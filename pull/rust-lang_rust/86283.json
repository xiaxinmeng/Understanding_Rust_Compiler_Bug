Part of that is that there's not a clear visual delineation between the end of one method's documentation and the summary of the next method.\r\n\r\nIn this demo I removed the `[-] pub fn` from the beginning of each function. My thinking is that `[-]` can be shown just when it needs to be. \"fn\" is implicit in the fact that we're in a section full of methods (and also the parentheses and arguments are a great hint that we're looking at `fn`s).\r\n\r\n\"pub\" is usually implicit since we're looking at documentation. There's the issue of `--document-private-items`, but we can solve that by marking the private items differently, rather than always marking public items so the private items can be noticed by their lack of \"pub\".\r\n\r\nI've also highlighted the methods with a border-top and a light grey background-color (same as the color on examples). For this I took inspiration from hexdocs (https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.html#json_library/0)  and Sphinx with the readthedocs theme (https://certbot.eff.org/docs/api/certbot.plugins.dns_common_lexicon.html). Both of those use a background color and a single border to make method headings stand out: hexdocs uses a border-left, and pydoc uses a border-top. I chose the same color we use as a border-right when a heading is `:target` (that is, when you've clicked on it from the sidebar or from a URL with a fragment).\r\n\r\nAnyhow, all sorts of feedback welcome. Do you see this as a problem in need of solving? Is this a good way to solve it? Are there other ways? I've intentionally not spent too much time polishing this PR, so if you don't wind up liking it don't worry that I'll be throwing too much work away.\r\n\r\n/cc @jyn514 @Manishearth @GuillaumeGomez
