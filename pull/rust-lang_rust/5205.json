It's an ordered container (by byte order, which is sorted order for integers and byte strings when done in the right direction) with O(1) worst-case lookup, removal and insertion. There's no rebalancing or rehashing so it's actually O(1) without amortizing any costs.\n\nThe fanout can be adjusted in multiples of 2 from 2-ary through 256-ary, but it's hardcoded at 16-ary because there isn't a way to expose that in the type system yet. To keep things simple, it also only allows `uint` keys, but later I'll expand it to all the built-in integer types and byte arrays.\n\nThere's quite a bit of room for performance improvement, along with the boost that will come with dropping the headers on `Owned` `~` and getting rid of the overhead from the stack switches to the allocator. It currently does suffix compression for a single node and then splits into two n-ary trie nodes, which could be replaced with an array for at least 4-8 suffixes before splitting it. There's also the option of doing path compression, which may be a good or a bad idea and depends a lot on the data stored.\n\nI want to share the test suite with the other maps so that's why I haven't duplicated all of the existing integer key tests in this file. I'll send in another pull request to deal with that.\n\nCurrent benchmark numbers against the other map types:\n\n```\nTreeMap:\n Sequential integers:\n  insert: 0.798295\n  search: 0.188931\n  remove: 0.435923\n Random integers:\n  insert: 1.557661\n  search: 0.758325\n  remove: 1.720527\n\nLinearMap:\n Sequential integers:\n  insert: 0.272338\n  search: 0.141179\n  remove: 0.190273\n Random integers:\n  insert: 0.293588\n  search: 0.162677\n  remove: 0.206142\n\nTrieMap:\n Sequential integers:\n  insert: 0.0901\n  search: 0.012223\n  remove: 0.084139\n Random integers:\n  insert: 0.392719\n  search: 0.261632\n  remove: 0.470401\n```\n\n@graydon is using an earlier version of this for the garbage collection implementation, so that's why I added this to libcore. I left out the `next` and `prev` methods _for now_ because I just wanted the essentials first.\n", "created_at": "2013-03-02T20:41:27Z", "updated_at": "2014-07-27T16:00:59Z", "closed_at":
