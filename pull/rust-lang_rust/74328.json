In that time these functions have undergone several iterations, with [the `async-std` impls](https://docs.rs/async-std/1.6.2/async_std/future/index.html) probably diverging the most (using `async fn`, which in hindsight was a mistake).\r\n\r\nIt seems the space around these functions has been _thoroughly_ explored over the last couple of years, and the ecosystem has settled on the current shape of the functions. It seems highly unlikely we'd want to make any further changes to these functions, so I propose we stabilize.\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nThis stabilization PR was fairly straightforward; this feature has already thoroughly been reviewed by the libs team already in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70834.
