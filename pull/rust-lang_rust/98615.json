LLVM types are already quite lossy. also, the representation of LLVM constants I was floating back then in the context of removing LLVM aggregates, [turned into a miri \"abstract allocation\" representation proposal](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/mir-constant-evaluation/3143/31), so it wasn't entirely a waste of time)</sub>\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nA couple notes for context:\r\n* historically the lack of opaque pointers, and the (perceived?) need to represent Rust types (or rather, their layouts) using LLVM aggregates, had delayed (and complicated) what we now call the `rustc` ABI/layout system (thankfully we didn't end up needing cycle detection for \"mutual recursion\" groups)\r\n* I was looking into [generalizing \"scalar pair\" layouts the other day](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/97861#issuecomment-1167313517), and the interaction with LLVM struct types is getting in the way a lot (both coming up with appropriate LLVM types for \"scalar components\", and subsequent GEPs)\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nSome additional concerns come from backends that are even higher-level than LLVM:\r\n* **`rustc_codegen_gcc`** (cc @antoyo)\r\n  * not super familiar with it, but I suspect it could also switch fully to untyped pointers\r\n* **`rustc_codegen_spirv`**\r\n  * currently takes advantage of being able to represent Rust `struct` types (and a limited selection of `enum`s, based on layout) as SPIR-V structs\r\n  * already handles pointer-casting GEPs (i.e. it tries to recover a castless GEP based on the offset), so all it really needs is to see the layout in `alloca` and all the call ABI handling\r\n    * that is, its backend `Value`s would be tracking a richer SPIR-V type than `rustc_codegen_ssa` needs or wants for the backend `Type`, in an opaque-pointer/aggreggate-less world\r\n  * long-term the plan is to introduce a SPIR-V derivative IR that would more readily allow both representing the \"untyped memory\" semantics Rust wants, and legalizing it away (mostly into SSA values, but inferring \"typed memory\" is also an option for some things)\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how well we can test the LLVM optimization impact of this PR, but to some extent a perf run might be able to reflect at least the impact on `rustc`'s code.\r\n\r\ncc @rust-lang/wg-llvm @bjorn3 @tmiasko", "created_at":
