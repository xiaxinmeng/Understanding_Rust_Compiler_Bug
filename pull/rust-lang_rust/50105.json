This currently only\r\naffects the start files, which is enough to allow building rustc on musl\r\ntargets.\r\n\r\nMost of the changes are analogous to crt-static.\r\n\r\nExcluding the start files is something musl based distributions usually patch into their copy of rustc: \r\n  - https://github.com/alpinelinux/aports/blob/eb064c8/community/rust/musl-fix-linux_musl_base.patch\r\n  - https://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages/blob/77400fc/srcpkgs/rust/patches/link-musl-dynamically.patch\r\n\r\nFor third-party distributions that not yet carry those patches it would be nice if it was supported without the need to patch upstream sources.\r\n\r\n## Reasons\r\n### What breaks?\r\nSome start files were missed when originally writing the logic to swap in musl start files (gcc comes with its own start files, which are suppressed by -nostdlib, but not manually included later on). This caused #36710, which also affects rustc with the internal llvm copy or any other system libraries that need crtbegin/crtend.\r\n\r\n### How is it fixed?\r\nThe system linker already has all the logic to decide which start files to include, so we can just defer to it (except of course if it doesn't target musl).\r\n\r\n### Why is it optional?\r\nIn #40113 it was first tried to remove the start files, which broke compiling musl-targeting static binaries with a glibc-targeting compiler. This is why it eventually landed without removing the start files. Being an option side-steps the issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the start files still installed?\r\nThis has the nice side-effect, that the produced rust-std-* binaries can still be used by on a glibc-targeting system with a rustc built against glibc.\r\n\r\n## Does it work?\r\nWith the following build script (using [musl-cross-make](https://github.com/richfelker/musl-cross-make)): https://shadowice.org/~mixi/rust-musl/build.sh, I was able to cross-compile a musl-host musl-targeting rustc on a glibc-based system. The resulting binaries are at https://shadowice.org/~mixi/rust-musl/binaries/. This also requires #50103 and #50104 (which are also applied to the branch the build script uses).\r\n\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2018-04-20T09:41:21Z", "updated_at": "2018-05-13T14:48:51Z", "closed_at": "2018-05-11T23:06:34Z", "merged_at": "2018-05-11T23:06:34Z", "merge_commit_sha": "490d05055abd36521abc41c2e551ac789820e80f", "assignee": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
