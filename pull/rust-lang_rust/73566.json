The main issue is that it does not preserve the validity of the `DefId` tree, meaning that operations on DefIds may unexpectedly fail when called later. This is blocking intra-doc links (see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73101).\r\n\r\nThis PR starts by removing `everybody_loops`, fixing #71104 and #71820. However, that brings back the bugs seen originally in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/43348: Since libstd documents items for all platforms, the function bodies sometimes do not type check. Here are the errors from documenting `libstd` with `everybody_loops` disabled and no other changes:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nerror[E0433]: failed to resolve: could not find `handle` in `sys`\r\n  --> src/libstd/sys/windows/ext/process.rs:13:27\r\n   |\r\n13 |         let handle = sys::handle::Handle::new(handle as *mut _);\r\n   |                           ^^^^^^ could not find `handle` in `sys`\r\n\r\nerror[E0425]: cannot find function `symlink_inner` in module `sys::fs`\r\n   --> src/libstd/sys/windows/ext/fs.rs:544:14\r\n    |\r\n544 |     sys::fs::symlink_inner(src.as_ref(), dst.as_ref(), false)\r\n    |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ not found in `sys::fs`\r\n\r\nerror[E0425]: cannot find function `symlink_inner` in module `sys::fs`\r\n   --> src/libstd/sys/windows/ext/fs.rs:564:14\r\n    |\r\n564 |     sys::fs::symlink_inner(src.as_ref(), dst.as_ref(), true)\r\n    |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ not found in `sys::fs`\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Why does this need changes to `rustc_resolve`?\r\n\r\nNormally, this could be avoided by simply not calling the `typeck_item_bodies` pass. However, the errors above happen before type checking, in name resolution itself. Since name resolution is intermingled with macro expansion, and rustdoc needs expansion to happen before it knows all items to be documented, there needs to be someway to ignore _resolution_ errors in function bodies.\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution suggested by @petrochenkov was to not run `everybody_loops` on anything containing a nested `DefId`. This would solve some of the immediate issues, but isn't bullet-proof: the following functions still could not be documented if the items in the body failed to resolve:\r\n\r\n- Functions containing a nested `DefId` (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/71104)\r\n- ~~Functions returning `impl Trait` (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/43878)~~ These ended up not resolving anyway with this PR.\r\n- ~~`const fn`, because `loop {}` in `const fn` is unstable (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43636)~~ `const_loop` was just stabilized.\r\n\r\nThis also isn't exactly what rustdoc wants, which is to avoid looking at function bodies in the first place.\r\n\r\n<a id=\"what-changes-were-made\" href=\"#what-changes-were-made\">\r\n\r\n## What changes were made?\r\n\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nThe hack implemented in this PR is to add an option to ignore all resolution errors in function bodies. This is enabled only for rustdoc. Since resolution errors are ignored, the MIR generated will be invalid, as can be seen in the following ICE:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nerror: internal compiler error: broken MIR in DefId(0:11 ~ doc_cfg[8787]::uses_target_feature[0]) (\"return type\"): bad type [type error]\r\n  --> /home/joshua/src/rust/src/test/rustdoc/doc-cfg.rs:51:1\r\n   |\r\n51 | / pub unsafe fn uses_target_feature() {\r\n52 | |     content::should::be::irrelevant();\r\n53 | | }\r\n   | |_^\r\n```\r\n\r\nFortunately, rustdoc does not need to access MIR in order to generate documentation. Therefore this also removes the call to `analyze()` in `rustdoc::run_core`. This has the side effect of not generating all lints by default. Most lints are safe to ignore (does rustdoc really need to run liveness analysis?) but `missing_docs` in particular is disabled when it should not be. Re-running `missing_docs` specifically does not help, because it causes the typechecking pass to be run, bringing back the errors from #24658:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror[E0599]: no method named `into_handle` found for struct `sys::unix::pipe::AnonPipe` in the current scope\r\n  --> src/libstd/sys/windows/ext/process.rs:71:27\r\n   |\r\n71 |         self.into_inner().into_handle().into_raw() as *mut _\r\n   |                           ^^^^^^^^^^^ method not found in `sys::unix::pipe::AnonPipe`\r\n   |\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of #73743, we only run typeck on demand. So this only causes an issue for functions returning `impl Trait`, which were already special cased by `ReplaceFunctionWithBody`. However, it now considers `async fn f() -> T` to be considered `impl Future<Output = T>`, where before it was considered to have a concrete `T` type.\r\n\r\n## How will this affect future changes to rustdoc?\r\n\r\n- Any new changes to rustdoc will not be able to perform type checking without bringing back resolution errors in function bodies.\r\n    + As a corollary, any new lints cannot require or perform type checking. In some cases this may require refactoring other parts of the compiler to perform type-checking only on-demand, see for example #73743.\r\n    + As a corollary, rustdoc can never again call `tcx.analysis()` unless this PR is reverted altogether.\r\n\r\n## Current status\r\n\r\n- ~~I am not yet sure how to bring back `missing_docs` without running typeck. @eddyb suggested allowing lints to opt-out of type-checking, which would probably be another rabbit hole.~~ The opt-out was implemented in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73743. However, of the rustc lints, now _only_ missing_docs is run and no other lints: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73566#issuecomment-650213058. We need a team decision on whether that's an acceptable tradeoff. Note that all rustdoc lints are still run (`intra_doc_link_resolution_failure`, etc). **UPDATE**: This was deemed acceptable in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73566#issuecomment-655750237\r\n- ~~The implementation of optional errors in `rustc_resolve` is very brute force, it should probably be moved from `LateResolver` to `Resolver` to avoid duplicating the logic in many places.~~ I'm mostly happy with it now.\r\n\r\n- This no longer allows errors in `async fn f() -> T`. This caused breakage in 50 crates out of a full crater run, all of which (that I looked at) didn't compile when run with rustc directly. In other words, it used to be that they could not be compiled but could still be documented; now they can't be documented either. This needs a decision from the rustdoc team on whether this is acceptable breakage. **UPDATE**: This was deemed acceptable in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73566#issuecomment-655750237\r\n- ~~This makes `fn typeck_tables_of` in `rustc_typeck` public. This is not desired behavior, but needs the changes from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74070 in order to be fixed.~~ Reverted.", "created_at": "2020-06-20T22:33:20Z", "updated_at": "2020-12-20T04:14:00Z", "closed_at": "2020-07-16T22:24:10Z", "merged_at": "2020-07-16T22:24:10Z", "merge_commit_sha": "c23f045a8b10c92eef5b1fbefea7696065e5977c", "assignee": {"login": "eddyb", "id": 77424, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDI0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77424?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb", "html_url": "https://github.com/eddyb", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "eddyb", "id": 77424, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDI0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77424?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb", "html_url": "https://github.com/eddyb", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 203738, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM3Mzg=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-rustdoc", "name": "T-rustdoc", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the rustdoc team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 239393, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzkzOTM=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/A-resolve", "name": "A-resolve", "color": "f7e101", "default": false, "description": "Area: Path resolution"}, {"id": 178802147, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxNzg4MDIxNDc=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/I-needs-decision", "name": "I-needs-decision", "color": "e11d21", "default": false, "description": "Issues in need of decision."}, {"id": 211668100, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgxMDA=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-compiler", "name": "T-compiler", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the compiler team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
