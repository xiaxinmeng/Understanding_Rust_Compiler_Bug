This makes the API more consistent with similar functions already in the stdlib, for example [`std::iter::from_fn`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/fn.from_fn.html), and removes some awkwardness from the naming (I remember being confused by what `poll_fn` meant when I first encountered it).\r\n\r\n## Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThe main rationale not to name this `core::future::from_fn` is that the `futures` crate also exposes [`futures::future::lazy`](https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/future/fn.lazy.html) which also takes a closure. That would mean we'd have two functions that take a closure at top level. However the stdlib exposes `std::iter::once`, which exists next to `std::iter::from_fn` with both functions creating an iterator from a function; meaning there would be precedent for having both functions in the same hierarchy.\r\n\r\nHowever I don't think `futures::future::lazy` is a good fit for the stdlib, and I'd be surprised if we saw it stabilized. It was designed before we had `async/.await` in the language, as a convenience function to create \"lazy values\" . But most of its uses have been replaced by async blocks since:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// lazy\r\nuse std::future::lazy;\r\nlet fut = lazy(|_| \"world\");\r\nprintln!(\"hello {}\", fut.await);\r\n\r\n// async blocks\r\nlet fut = async { \"world\" };\r\nprintln!(\"hello {}\", fut.await);\r\n```\r\nWith the expected addition of async closures to the language, it's likely the uses for `futures::future::lazy` will only decrease further. Async closures are expected to be able to take closures, take borrows as arguments, and support `.await` inside of the closure body. Which makes it seem quite likely we'll only ever expose a single \"create a future from a closure\" method in the `core::future` hierarchy.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ncc/ @rust-lang/wg-async-foundations ",
