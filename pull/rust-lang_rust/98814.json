By that, I mean that my proposed patch is\r\nnot the best solution but one that does not change as much existing code.\r\nIt treats symptoms rather than the root cause.\r\n\r\nThis PR \u201ccensors\u201d certain complex unevaluated constant expressions like `match`es, blocks, function calls, struct literals etc. by pretty-printing them as `_` / `{ _ }` (number and string literals, paths and `()` are still printed as one would expect).\r\nResorting to this placeholder is preferable to printing the full expression verbatim since\r\nthey can be quite large and verbose resulting in an unreadable mess in the generated documentation.\r\nFurther, mindlessly printing the const would leak private and `doc(hidden)` struct fields (#97933), at least in the current\r\nstable & nightly implementations which rely on `span_to_snippet` (!) and `rustc_hir_pretty::id_to_string`.\r\n\r\nThe censoring of _verbose_ expressions is probably going to stay longer term.\r\nHowever, in regards to private and `doc(hidden)` struct fields, I have a more proper fix in mind\r\nwhich I have already partially implemented locally and for which I am going to open a separate PR sometime soon.\r\nFor that, I was already in contact with @GuillaumeGomez.\r\nThe proper fix involves rustdoc not falling back on pretty-printing unevaluated consts so easily (what this PR is concerned about)\r\nand instead preferring to print evaluated consts which contain more information allowing it to selectively hide private and `doc(hidden)` fields, create hyperlinks etc. generally making the output more granular and precise (compared to the brutal `_` placeholder).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I was a bit too late and the issue just hit stable (1.62).\r\nShould this be backported to beta or even a potential 1.62.1?\r\n\r\nr? @GuillaumeGomez ", "created_at": "2022-07-02T16:59:10Z", "updated_at": "2022-07-05T07:10:46Z", "closed_at": "2022-07-05T01:23:12Z", "merged_at": "2022-07-05T01:23:12Z", "merge_commit_sha": "9ad3ef13ac6b9a1c73f1129f0925740607a0961a", "assignee": {"login": "GuillaumeGomez", "id": 3050060, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTAwNjA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3050060?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez", "html_url": "https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "GuillaumeGomez", "id": 3050060, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTAwNjA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3050060?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez", "html_url": "https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 203738, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM3Mzg=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-rustdoc", "name": "T-rustdoc", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the rustdoc team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
