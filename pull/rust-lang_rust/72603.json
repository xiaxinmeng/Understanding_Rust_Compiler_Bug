The goal of this PR is to allow rustc, in coordination with the build system, to present a useful diagnostic about how to remove an unnecessary dependency from a dependency specification file (eg Cargo.toml).\r\n\r\nEDIT: Updated to current PR state.\r\n\r\nThe location is specified for each named crate - that is, for a given `--extern foo[=path]` there can also be `--extern-location foo=<location>`. It supports ~~three~~ two styles of location:\r\n~~1. `--extern-location foo=file:<path>:<line>` - a file path and line specification\r\n1. `--extern-location foo=span:<path>:<start>:<end>` - a span specified as a file and start and end byte offsets~~\r\n1. `--extern-location foo=raw:<anything>` - a raw string which is included in the output\r\n1. `--extern-location foo=json:<anything>` - an arbitrary Json structure which is emitted via Json diagnostics in a `tool_metadata` field.\r\n\r\n~~1 & 2 are turned into an internal `Span`, so long as the path exists and is readable, and the location is meaningful (within the file, etc). This is used as the `Span` for a fix suggestion which is reported like other fix suggestions.~~\r\n\r\n`raw` and `json` are for the case where the location isn't best expressed as a file and location within that file. For example, it could be a rule name and the name of a dependency within that rule. `rustc` makes no attempt to parse the raw string, and simply includes it in the output diagnostic text. `json` is only included in json diagnostics. `raw` is emitted as text and also as a json string in `tool_metadata`.\r\n\r\nIf no `--extern-location` option is specified then it will emit a default json structure consisting of `{\"name\": name, \"path\": path}` corresponding to the name and path in `--extern name=path`.\r\n\r\nThis is a prototype/RFC to make some of the earlier conversations more concrete. It doesn't stand on its own - it's only useful if implemented by Cargo and other build systems. There's also a ton of implementation details which I'd appreciate a second eye on as well.\r\n\r\n~~**NOTE** The first commit in this PR is #72342 and should be ignored for the purposes of review. The first commit is a very simplistic implementation which is basically raw-only, presented as a MVP. The second implements the full thing, and subsequent commits are incremental fixes.~~\r\n\r\ncc @ehuss @est31 @petrochenkov @estebank ", "created_at": "2020-05-26T05:42:36Z", "updated_at": "2021-02-08T05:05:58Z", "closed_at": "2021-02-08T05:05:56Z", "merged_at": "2021-02-08T05:05:56Z", "merge_commit_sha": "0b7a598e12649d7ab2415a82cbc3fea879fa9dab", "assignee": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, {"login": "matthewjasper", "id": 20113453, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTEzNDUz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20113453?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/matthewjasper", "html_url": "https://github.com/matthewjasper", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matthewjasper/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matthewjasper/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matthewjasper/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matthewjasper/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matthewjasper/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matthewjasper/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matthewjasper/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matthewjasper/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/matthewjasper/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 211668100, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgxMDA=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-compiler", "name": "T-compiler", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the compiler team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
