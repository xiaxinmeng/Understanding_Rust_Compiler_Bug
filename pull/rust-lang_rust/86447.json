The result of this means that volume management functions may fail. Unfortunately these functions include looking up the drive name, which in turn means that `std::fs::canonicalize` won't work.\r\n\r\n# The workaround\r\n\r\nThe solution presented here is to detect when querying the drive name fails and fallback to using the NT kernel path. This can be used in win32 by prepending `\\\\?\\GLOBALROOT` to the kernel path ([as documented here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#nt-namespaces)). The downside of this solution is that it produces \"weird\" looking paths that a user may not recognise and other applications may not be able to use.\r\n\r\nE.g. this path:\r\n\r\n    R:\\path\\to\\file.txt\r\n\r\nMay be canonicalized like so:\r\n\r\n    \\\\?\\GLOBALROOT\\Device\\ImDisk0\\path\\to\\file.txt\r\n\r\nBut it is at least usable by `std::fs` and it's perhaps better than having the crashes reported in some of the issues above.\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\n\r\nWorking in the presence of these drivers can be tricky and normally I would just suggest this isn't Rust's problem (which it technically isn't). However, these drivers seem widespread enough that I think it makes sense to try to workaround them, at least in this specific case.", "created_at": "2021-06-18T21:03:37Z", "updated_at":
