If that's important I can go through them again and try a more principled approach. When I run `rg '```ignore \\(' .` on the repo, there look to be lots of different conventions other people have used for this sort of thing. I could try unifying them all if that would be helpful.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if there was a better existing way to do this but I wrote my own script to help me run all the doctests and wade through the output.
