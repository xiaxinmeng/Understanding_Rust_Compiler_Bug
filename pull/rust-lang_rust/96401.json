The `on` and `off` values force the rust-provided CRT objects to be linked.\r\n\r\nThe way to choose the target-defined behavior is to omit the flag, there is no value one can use.\r\n\r\nProposed behavior: to model using a rust-provided linker (like `rust-lld`), a new value `-C link-self-contained=linker` is added. This flag becomes a bit more complex, controlling two facets: the CRT linking, and the use of a `rustup` linker.\r\n\r\nIn order to not change stable behavior:\r\n- `-C link-self-contained=y` still targets only the CRT linking (although it can be argued that this could opt in to both)\r\n- `-C link-self-contained=n` disables both\r\n- `-C link-self-contained=linker` turns on the linker facet, but keeps the default CRT facet\r\n- a value reifying the current default, to make it explicit for the future: `-C link-self-contained=auto`. If `linker` ever becomes a default, this would allow to turn off the linker facet while still keeping the target-defined CRT-linking behavior. Otherwise, the fact that this value is only available when the flag is absent will prevent picking it explicitly.\r\n- depending on whether we'd want `-C link-self-contained=y` to mean a single or both facets, a value like `-C link-self-contained=crt` would be useful if `linker` ever became the default: this would allow to turn off the linker facet while opting into the CRT-linking.\r\n- turning both on with `-C link-self-contained=all`. We had discussed e.g. `-C link-self-contained=crt,linker`, but without a way or need to turn off CRT-linking while enabling the linker (a use-case `-C link-self-contained=linker` would serve most of the time, as the CRT-linking is only enabled in a very limited number or targets) it doesn't seem that useful to specify both as `crt,linker`. If we need a way to do so, then `-C link-self-contained=crt,linker` and e.g. `-C link-self-contained=no-crt,linker` could be used.\r\n\r\n##### 2. `-C linker-flavor`\r\nToday, `-C linker-flavor` is [a list of flavor mappings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3d237ab52920924694f6fc3e47ee8588514bfa70/compiler/rustc_target/src/spec/mod.rs#L161-L173) (`LinkerFlavor`s) that target specs can use.\r\n\r\nProposed behavior: these stable values are retained, but a new extensible one is added for the `gcc` flavor: `gcc:*`. The `gcc:` prefix would allow to specify a linker for `cc` to use, much like one would add a `-fuse-ld` link-arg today: `-C linker-flavor=gcc:lld` would be a thin wrapper over that, and pass `-fuse-ld=lld` to the `cc` process.\r\n\r\n##### 3. `-C linker-flavor=gcc:lld -C link-self-contained=linker`\r\n\r\nThis is the combination that allows using `rust-lld`, by providing either `-fuse-ld` or `-B` with the sysroot path containing the `lld-wrapper`s that will launch `rust-lld`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOpening as draft for discussion about:\r\n- the naming of the options and structures, for the two flags\r\n- the new behavior of `-Clink-self-contained` described above: the individual and aggregate opt-ins and opt-outs, making sure that stable behavior is preserved, and that there are adequate options to keep the stable behavior if `linker` becomes a default one day \r\n- the zulip thread mentioned opportunities for cleanups but I'm not 100% sure what they are, but they can probably be done in follow-up PRs.\r\n\r\nand because:\r\n- I wonder what should we do on windows gnu ? Since IIUC it supports a `gcc` linker-flavor (and `rust-lld` already with `-C linker=rust-lld`). Maybe nothing in particular\r\n- and how/if we need to mention the unstable values in the `--help` text or wait for when we'll drop the  `-Z unstable-options` requirement ?\r\n- I'm not sure about some of the `run-make` tests, maybe some need to be more constrained (e.g. linux only), and would love feedback about them\r\n\r\n\r\nr? @ghost", "created_at": "2022-04-25T18:53:06Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-13T07:05:21Z", "closed_at": "2023-05-13T07:04:56Z", "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha": "2f9f479161b4f2d1a49962bb7ef8ab692b669859", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 211668100, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgxMDA=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-compiler", "name": "T-compiler", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the compiler team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 627350354, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw2MjczNTAzNTQ=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-inactive", "name": "S-inactive", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Inactive and waiting on the author.
