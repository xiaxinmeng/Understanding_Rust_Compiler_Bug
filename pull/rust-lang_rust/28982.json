Currently, there is no way to set the controlling terminal of a child process using the `std::process::Command` API. I am working on a library which abstracts over the tty subsystem; this method is needed to create a Rustic equivalent to fork_pty(3).\n\nThe proposed API works like this:\n- Calling `Command::tty()` sets session_leader to true, regardless of whether or not session_leader() has been called. It prevents future calls to session_leader from having any impact.\n- `Command::tty()` does not automatically cause the controlling terminal to be set as the stdio handles of the child process. To do that, one needs to call the appropriate methods with `Stdio::from_raw_fd(fd)` or the like. I made this decision to make the API more flexible (e.g. if you want to run a process that needs to have a controlling terminal set for some reason, but you don't want to communicate with it over that tty pair).\n- During `Command::spawn()`, in the child process, after setting the process to be the leader of a new session, if an fd has been set to be the ctty for the child, this change is performed using the TIOCSCTTY ioctl.\n\nI think this code is correct, but I feel a bit out of my depth with regard to a few things. In particular: is TIOCSCTTY supported, with the same ioctl number, on all relevant platforms? is closing the file descriptor in the child process the correct behavior in the context of Rust's RAII?\n", "created_at": "2015-10-12T04:36:01Z", "updated_at": "2015-12-02T22:44:21Z", "closed_at": "2015-12-02T22:44:20Z", "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha":
