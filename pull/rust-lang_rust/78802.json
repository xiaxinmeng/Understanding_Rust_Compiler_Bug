No other intentional changes are introduced to public API.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to observe the current layout of these types (e.g., by pointer casting); most but not all libraries which were found by Crater to do this have had updates issued and affected versions yanked. See report below.\r\n\r\n### Benefits of this change\r\n\r\n- It will become possible to move these fundamental network types from `std` into `core` ([RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2832)).\r\n- Some methods that can't be made `const fn`s today can be made `const fn`s with this change.\r\n- `SocketAddrV4` only occupies 6 bytes instead of 16 bytes.\r\n- These simple primitives become easier to read and uses less `unsafe`.\r\n- Makes these types support structural equality, which means you can now (for instance) match an `Ipv4Addr` against a constant\r\n\r\n### ~Remaining~ Previous problems\r\n\r\nThis change obviously changes the memory layout of the types. And it turns out some libraries invalidly assumes the memory layout and does very dangerous pointer casts to convert them. These libraries will have undefined behaviour and perform invalid memory access until patched.\r\n\r\n- [x] - `mio` - Issue: https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/issues/1386.\r\n  - [x] `0.7` branch https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/pull/1388\r\n  - [x] `0.7.6` published https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/pull/1398\r\n  - [x] Yank all `0.7` versions older than `0.7.6`\r\n  - [x] Report `<0.7.6` to RustSec Advisory Database https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0081.html\r\n- [x] - `socket2` - Issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/socket2-rs/issues/119.\r\n  - [x] `0.3.x` branch https://github.com/rust-lang/socket2-rs/pull/120\r\n  - [x] `0.3.16` published\r\n  - [x] `master` branch https://github.com/rust-lang/socket2-rs/pull/122\r\n  - [x] Yank all `0.3` versions older than `0.3.16`\r\n  - [x] Report `<0.3.16` to RustSec Advisory Database https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0079.html\r\n- [x] - `net2` - Issue: https://github.com/deprecrated/net2-rs/issues/105\r\n  - [x] https://github.com/deprecrated/net2-rs/pull/106\r\n  - [x] `0.2.36` published\r\n  - [x] Yank all `0.2` versions older than `0.2.36`\r\n  - [x] Report `<0.2.36` to RustSec Advisory Database https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0078.html\r\n- [x] - `miow` - Issue: https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/miow/issues/38\r\n  - [x] `0.3.x` - https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/miow/pull/39\r\n  - [x] `0.3.6` published\r\n  - [x] `0.2.x` - https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/miow/pull/40\r\n  - [x] `0.2.2` published\r\n  - [x] Yanked all `0.2` versions older than `0.2.2`\r\n  - [x] Yanked all `0.3` versions older than `0.3.6`\r\n  - [x] Report `<0.2.2` and `<0.3.6` to RustSec Advisory Database https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0080.html\r\n- [x] - `quinn master` (aka what became 0.7) - https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/issues/968 https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/987\r\n  - [x] - `quinn 0.6` - https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/1045\r\n  - [x] - `quinn 0.5` - https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/pull/1046\r\n  - [x] - Release `0.7.0`, `0.6.2` and `0.5.4`\r\n- [x] - `nb-connect` - https://github.com/smol-rs/nb-connect/issues/1\r\n  - [x] - Release `1.0.3`\r\n  - [x] - Yank all versions older than `1.0.3`\r\n- [x] - `shadowsocks-rust` - https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-rust/issues/462\r\n- [ ] - `rio` - https://github.com/spacejam/rio/issues/44\r\n- [ ] - `seaslug` - https://github.com/spacejam/seaslug/issues/1\r\n\r\n#### Fixed crate versions\r\n\r\nAll crates I have found that assumed the memory layout have been fixed and published.

The standard library no longer implements these as the corresponding `libc` structs (`sockaddr_in`, `sockaddr_in6` etc.). This internal representation was never exposed, but some crates relied on it anyway by unsafely transmuting. This change will cause those crates to make invalid memory accesses. Notably `net2 <0.2.36`, `socket2 <0.3.16`, `mio <0.7.6`, `miow <0.3.6` and a few other crates are affected. All known affected crates have been patched and have had fixed versions published over a year ago. If any affected crate is still in your dependency tree, you need to upgrade them before using this version of Rust.\r\n", "created_at": "2020-11-06T07:52:13Z", "updated_at": "2022-11-10T17:42:14Z", "closed_at": "2022-07-31T18:59:30Z", "merged_at": "2022-07-31T18:59:30Z", "merge_commit_sha": "3405e402faf413ef4633142225228c260a91dd9d", "assignee": {"login": "joshtriplett", "id": 162737, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjczNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162737?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett", "html_url": "https://github.com/joshtriplett", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "joshtriplett", "id": 162737, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjczNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162737?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett", "html_url": "https://github.com/joshtriplett", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 211668062, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgwNjI=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-libs-api", "name": "T-libs-api", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the library API team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 223796632, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMjM3OTY2MzI=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/relnotes", "name": "relnotes", "color": "fad8c7", "default": false, "description": "Marks issues that should be documented in the release notes of the next release."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
