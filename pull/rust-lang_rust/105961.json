Unfortunately, I had to duplicate a lot of the diagnostic code found in `rustc_hir_typeck::method::suggest` which we don't have access to in `rustc_hir_analysis`. Not sure if there is a simple way to unify the error handling. Note that in the future, `rustc_hir_analysis::astconv` might not actually be the place where we resolve inherent associated types (see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103621#issuecomment-1304309565) but `rustc_hir_typeck` (?) in which case the duplication may naturally just disappear. While inherent associated *constants* are currently resolved during \"method\" probing, I did not find a straightforward way to incorporate IAT lookup into it as types and values (functions & constants) are two separate entities for which distinct code paths are taken.\r\n\r\nFixes #104251 (incl. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/104251#issuecomment-1338501171).\r\nFixes #105305.\r\nFixes #107468.\r\n\r\n@rustbot label T-types F-inherent_associated_types\r\nr? types\r\n", "created_at": "2022-12-20T15:46:34Z", "updated_at": "2023-02-20T12:27:41Z", "closed_at": "2023-02-20T03:37:46Z", "merged_at": "2023-02-20T03:37:46Z", "merge_commit_sha": "7b552967b8ed122aa949cddac8c2270b6490e64e", "assignee": {"login": "jackh726", "id": 31162821, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTYyODIx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31162821?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726", "html_url": "https://github.com/jackh726", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "jackh726", "id": 31162821, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTYyODIx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31162821?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726", "html_url": "https://github.com/jackh726", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 211668100, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgxMDA=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-compiler", "name": "T-compiler", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the compiler team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
