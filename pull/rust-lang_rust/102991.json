It has a few advantages over the current design:\r\n* It allows the buffer to be of length 0, which means the `VecDeque::new` new longer has to allocate and could be changed to a `const fn`\r\n* It allows the `VecDeque` to fill the buffer completely, unlike the old implementation, which always had to leave a free space\r\n* It removes the restriction for the size to be a power of two, allowing it to properly `shrink_to_fit`, unlike the old `VecDeque`\r\n* The above points also combine to allow the `Vec<T> -> VecDeque<T>` conversion to be very cheap and guaranteed O(1). I mention this in the `From<Vec<T>>` impl, but it's not a strong guarantee just yet, as that would likely need some form of API change proposal.\r\n\r\nAll the tests seem to pass for the new `VecDeque`, with some slight adjustments.\r\n\r\nr? @scottmcm ", "created_at": "2022-10-12T23:07:12Z", "updated_at": "2022-12-02T20:44:13Z", "closed_at": "2022-11-28T13:20:42Z", "merged_at": "2022-11-28T13:20:42Z", "merge_commit_sha": "69df0f2c2f665d7f4e38a3579a81d4efc0d81034", "assignee": {"login": "scottmcm", "id": 18526288, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTI2Mjg4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18526288?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm", "html_url": "https://github.com/scottmcm", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "scottmcm", "id": 18526288, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTI2Mjg4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18526288?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm", "html_url": "https://github.com/scottmcm", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 120005, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAwMDU=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/A-testsuite", "name": "A-testsuite", "color": "f7e101", "default": false, "description": "Area: The testsuite used to check the correctness of rustc"}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
