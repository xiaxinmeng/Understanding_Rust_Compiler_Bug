As long as tasks use at least 64KB (in user stack, kernel stack, etc.) and 64-bit platforms actually only provide 48-bit addressing (this is the case for x86-64 right now) the 2^16/2^32 limitation cannot be overrun\n2. Anyway, Pentium Pro+ and ARMv6+ provide 64-bit atomics in 32-bit mode (cmpxchg8b and ldrexd etc.) and x86-64 processors beyond the early Opterons as well as ARMv8 provide 128-bit atomics in 64-bit mode (cmpxchg16b), so it's only a matter of implementing support for and using those if desired\n\nCurrently Rust uses 2MB stacks by default, so programs that don't specify the stack size manually already cannot trip this limitation.\n", "created_at": "2014-01-13T22:34:15Z", "updated_at": "2014-06-12T10:35:09Z", "closed_at": "2014-01-16T01:15:26Z", "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha":
