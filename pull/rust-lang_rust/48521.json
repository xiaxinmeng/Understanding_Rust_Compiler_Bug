Each commit is intended to be relatively small, even though the overall patch is quite large. I would recommend reviewing by-commit for review purposes. I'm happy to split this PR up into smaller ones if that makes things easier -- the last commit (which implements the actual tests) is fairly small, though it builds on the refactoring done in the rest of the commits quite heavily.\r\n\r\n### Configuration refactor\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the configuration to utilize `Default` impls for the structs and to directly include toml-deserialized structs in the final `Config` struct. This avoids quite a bit of boilerplate code, and, in my opinion, makes it considerably easier to understand what the default value for a given option is. It's intended that nothing has actually changed, but it's possible that I've accidentally forgotten some option -- I've tried to check manually and found nothing relevant.\r\n\r\n### Testing design (also included in relevant commit)\r\n\r\nIn order to run tests, various parts of rustbuild are cfg'd out,\r\ngenerally speaking, these are filesystem-related operations and running\r\ncommands. Then, rustbuild is run \"as normal\" and the various steps that\r\nwhere run are retrieved from the cache and checked against the expected\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nNote that this means that the current implementation primarily tests\r\n\"what\" we build, but doesn't actually test that what we build *will*\r\nbuild. In other words, it doesn't do any form of dependency verification\r\nfor any crate. This is possible to implement, but is considered future\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThis implementation strives to cfg out as little code as possible; it\r\nalso does not currently test anywhere near all of rustbuild. The current\r\ntests are also not checked for \"correctness,\" rather, they simply\r\nrepresent what we do as of this commit, which may be wrong.\r\n\r\nA fake fs module is also added to src/bootstrap/lib.rs and used\r\nthroughout rustbuild to make it so that most of the code doesn't have to\r\ncfg out create_dir_all and remove_dir_all, etc.\r\n\r\nTest cases are drawn from the old implementation of rustbuild, though\r\nthe expected results may vary.\r\n\r\nr? @alexcrichton ", "created_at": "2018-02-25T00:28:00Z", "updated_at": "2019-06-08T13:48:52Z", "closed_at":
