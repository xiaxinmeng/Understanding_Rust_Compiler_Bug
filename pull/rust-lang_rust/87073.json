I'm willing to split it up a little more if it would help reviewing, but it would be tricky and I'd rather not unless it's necessary.\r\n\r\n ## What does this do?\r\n\r\n- Fixes https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73423.\r\n- Fixes https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79630. I'm not sure how to test this for the standard library explicitly, but you can see from some of the diffs from the `no_std` tests. I also tested it locally and it works correctly: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23638587/125214383-e1fdd000-e284-11eb-8048-76b5df958aad.png)\r\n- Fixes https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83083.\r\n\r\n## Why are these changes interconnected?\r\n\r\n- Allowing anchors (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83083) without fixing the online/offline problem (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79630) will actually just silently discard the anchors, that's not a fix. The online/offline problem is directly related to the fragment hack; links need to go through `fn href()` to be fixed.\r\n- Technically I could fix the online/offline problem without removing the error on anchors; I am willing to separate that out if it would be helpful for reviewing. However I can't fix the anchor problem without adding docs to core, since rustdoc needs all those primitives to have docs to avoid a fallback, and currently `#![no_std]` crates don't have docs for primitives. I also can't fix the online/offline problem without removing the fragment hack, since otherwise diffs like this will be wrong for some primitives but not others:\r\n```diff\r\n@@ -385,7 +381,7 @@ fn resolve_primitive_associated_item(\r\n                         ty::AssocKind::Const => \"associatedconstant\",\r\n                         ty::AssocKind::Type => \"associatedtype\",\r\n                     };\r\n-                    let fragment = format!(\"{}#{}.{}\", prim_ty.as_sym(), out, item_name);\r\n+                    let fragment = format!(\"{}.{}\", out, item_name);\r\n                     (Res::Primitive(prim_ty), fragment, Some((kind.as_def_kind(), item.def_id)))\r\n                 })\r\n         })\r\n```\r\n- Adding primitive docs to core without making any other change will cause links to go to `core` instead of `std`, even for crates with `extern crate std`. See \"Breaking changes to doc(primitive)\" below for why this is the case. That said, I could add some special casing to rustdoc at the same time that would let me separate this change from the others (it would fix https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73423 but still special-case intra-doc links). I'm willing to separate that out if helpful for reviewing.\r\n\r\n### Add primitive documentation to libcore\r\n\r\nThis works by reusing the same `include!(\"primitive_docs.rs\")` file in both core and std, and then special-casing links in core to use relative links instead of intra-doc links. This doesn't use purely intra-doc links because some of the primitive docs links to items only in std; this doesn't use purely relative links because that introduces new broken links when the docs are re-exported (e.g. String's `&str` deref impl, or Vec's slice deref impl).\r\n\r\nNote that this copies the whole file to core, to avoid anyone compiling core to have to set `CARGO_PKG_NAME`. See https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/122651-general/topic/Who.20should.20review.20changes.20to.20linkchecker.3F/near/249939598 for more context. It also adds a tidy check to make sure the two files are kept in sync.\r\n\r\n### Fix inconsistent online/offline primitive docs\r\n\r\nThis does four things:\r\n- Records modules with `doc(primitive)` in `cache.external_paths`. This is necessary for `href()` to find them later.\r\n- Makes `cache.primitive_locations` available to the intra-doc link pass, by refactoring out a `PrimitiveType::primitive_locations` function that only uses `TyCtxt`.\r\n- Special cases modules with `doc(primitive)` to be treated as always public for the purpose of links.\r\n- Removes the fragment hack. cc @notriddle, I know you added some comments about this in the code (thank you for that!)\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes to `doc(primitive)`\r\n\r\n\"Breaking\" is a little misleading here - these are changes in behavior, none of them will cause code to fail to compile.\r\n\r\nLet me preface this by saying I think stabilizing `doc(primitive)` was a uniquely terrible idea. As far as I can tell, it was stabilized by oversight; it's been stable since 1.0. No one should have need to use it except the standard library, and a crater run shows that in fact no one is using it: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87050#issuecomment-886166706. I hope to actually make `doc(primitive)` a no-op unless you opt-in with a nightly feature, which will keep crates compiling without forcing rustdoc into trying to keep somewhat arbitrary behavior guarantees; but for now, this just subtly changes some of the behavior if you use `doc(primitive)` in a dependency.\r\n\r\nThat said, here are the changes:\r\n-  Refactoring out `primitive_locations()` is technically a change in behavior, since it no longer looks for primitives in crates that were passed through `--extern`, but not used by the crate; however, that seems like such an unlikely edge case it's not worth dealing with.\r\n- The precedence given to primitive locations is no longer just arbitrary, it can also be inconsistent from run to run. Let me explain that more: previously, primitive locations were sorted by the `CrateNum`; the comment on that sort said \"Favor linking to as local extern as possible, so iterate all crates in reverse topological order.\" Unfortunately, that's not actually what CrateNum tracks: it measures the order crates are loaded, not the number of intermediate crates between that dependency and the root crate. It happened to work as intended before because the compiler injects `extern crate std;` at the top of every crate, which ensured it would have the first CrateNum other than the current, but every other CrateNum was completely arbitrary (for example, `core` often had a later CrateNum than `std`). This now removes the sort on CrateNum completely and special-cases core instead. In particular, if you depend on both `std` and a crate which defines a `doc(primitive)` module, it's arbitrary whether rustdoc will use the docs from std or the ones from the other crate. cc @alexcrichton, you wrote this originally.\r\n\r\ncc @rust-lang/rustdoc\r\ncc @rust-lang/libs for the addition to `core` (the commit you're interested in is https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87073/commits/91346c8293bb5f41d8e1d2ec9336433664652c53)", "created_at": "2021-07-12T00:48:11Z", "updated_at": "2021-09-12T07:17:18Z", "closed_at": "2021-09-12T05:38:26Z", "merged_at": "2021-09-12T05:38:26Z", "merge_commit_sha": "0273e3bce7a0ce49e96a9662163e2380cb87e0be", "assignee": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 203738, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM3Mzg=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-rustdoc", "name": "T-rustdoc", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the rustdoc team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
