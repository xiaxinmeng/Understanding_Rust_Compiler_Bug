This has been noted in the documentation, however, and is in a must_use message.\r\n\r\nI didn't do this for the other smart pointer types (`Rc<T>` and `Arc<T>`) since it seemed less useful, and is semantically a bit hairier, I think. I'm happy to change that though, if desirable.\r\n\r\n~~I didn't make this generic over the Allocator parameter, mostly because the other From impls largely aren't (only a couple are). It's also not clear to me how that interacts with stability, although it's probably fine. Anyway, happy to change that as well.~~ Actually I was wrong, most of the similar impls are generic over the allocator, so this is too.\r\n\r\nThis is a trait implementation, so IIUC it's automatically stable (and thus needs to go through an FCP, I believe), and thus is marked as stable. I'm happy to change it to unstable if this wasn't correct information.", "created_at": "2021-01-02T09:50:27Z", "updated_at": "2021-01-02T11:48:35Z", "closed_at": "2021-01-02T11:47:42Z", "merged_at":
