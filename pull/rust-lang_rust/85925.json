I decided to reuse the feature request issue (#71015) as a tracking issue. A member of the rust-lang org will have to edit the original post to be formatted correctly as I am not the issue's original author.\r\n\r\nThe common name `lerp` is used because it is the term used by most code in a wide variety of contexts; it also happens to be the recently chosen name of the function that was added to C++20.\r\n\r\nTo ensure symmetry as a method, this breaks the usual ordering of the method from `lerp(a, b, t)` to `t.lerp(a, b)`. This makes the most sense to me personally, and there will definitely be discussion before stabilisation anyway.\r\n\r\nImplementing lerp \"correctly\" is very dififcult even though it's a very common building-block used in all sorts of applications. A good prior reading is [this proposal](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0811r2.html#linear-interpolation) for the C++20 lerp which talks about the various guarantees, which I've simplified down to:\r\n\r\n1. Exactness: `(0.0).lerp(start, end) == start` and `(1.0).lerp(start, end) == end`\r\n2. Consistency: `anything.lerp(x, x) == x`\r\n3. Monotonicity: once you go up don't go down\r\n\r\nFun story: the version provided in that proposal, from what I understand, isn't actually monotonic.\r\n\r\nI messed around with a *lot* of different lerp implementations because I kind of got a bit obsessed and I ultimately landed on one that uses the fused `mul_add` instruction. Floating-point lerp lore is hard to come by, so, just trust me when I say that this ticks all the boxes. I'm only 90% certain that it's monotonic, but I'm sure that people who care deeply about this will be there to discuss before stabilisation.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for using `mul_add` is that, in general, it ticks more boxes with fewer branches to be \"correct.\" Although it will be slower on architectures without the fused `mul_add`, that's becoming more and more rare and I have a feeling that most people who will find themselves needing `lerp` will also have an efficient `mul_add` instruction available.", "created_at": "2021-06-02T03:13:01Z", "updated_at": "2022-10-15T23:29:48Z", "closed_at": "2021-06-18T02:00:24Z", "merged_at": "2021-06-18T02:00:24Z", "merge_commit_sha": "fcac47896696899badc9a436d798d48158895ea3", "assignee": {"login": "m-ou-se", "id": 783247, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc4MzI0Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/783247?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se", "html_url": "https://github.com/m-ou-se", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "m-ou-se", "id": 783247, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc4MzI0Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/783247?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se", "html_url": "https://github.com/m-ou-se", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 211668062, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgwNjI=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-libs-api", "name": "T-libs-api", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the library API team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
