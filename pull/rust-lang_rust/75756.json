Also add `PerNS::iter()` for consistency. Let me know if this should be `impl IntoIterator` instead.\r\n- Make `ResolutionFailure` an enum instead of a unit variant. This was most of the changes: everywhere that said `ErrorKind::ResolutionFailure` now has to say _why_ the link failed to resolve.\r\n- Store the resolution in case of an anchor failure. Previously this was implemented as variants on `AnchorFailure` which was prone to typos and had inconsistent output compared to the rest of the diagnostics.\r\n- Turn some `Err`ors into unwrap() or panic()s, because they're rustdoc bugs and not user error. These have comments as to why they're bugs (in particular this would have caught #76073 as a bug a while ago).\r\n- If an item is not in scope at all, say the first segment in the path that failed to resolve\r\n- If an item exists but not in the current namespaces, say that and suggests linking to that namespace.\r\n- If there is a partial resolution for an item (part of the segments resolved, but not all of them), say the partial resolution and why the following segment didn't resolve.\r\n- Add the `DefId` of associated items to `kind_side_channel` so it can be used for diagnostics (tl;dr of the hack: the rest of rustdoc expects the id of the item, but for diagnostics we need the associated item).\r\n- No longer suggests escaping the brackets for every link that failed to resolve; this was pretty obnoxious. Now it only suggests `\\[ \\]` if no segment resolved and there is no `::` in the link.\r\n- Add `Suggestion`, which says _what_ to prefix the link with, not just 'prefix with the item kind'.\r\n\r\nPlaces where this is currently buggy:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>All outdated</summary>\r\n\r\n~~1.
