This API requires the user to manually construct a vtable for the waker themself - which is both cumbersome and very error prone. This API would provide an ergonomic, straightforward and guaranteed memory-safe way of constructing a waker.\r\n\r\nIt has been our longstanding intention that the `Waker` type essentially function as an `Arc<dyn Wake>`, with a `Wake` trait as defined here. Two considerations prevented the original API from being shipped as simply an `Arc<dyn Wake>`:\r\n\r\n- We want to support futures on embedded systems, which may not have an allocator, and in optimized executors for which this API may not be best-suited. Therefore, we have always explicitly supported the maximally-flexible (but also memory-unsafe) `RawWaker` API, and `Waker` has always lived in libcore.\r\n- Because `Waker` lives in libcore and `Arc` lives in liballoc, it has not been feasible to provide a constructor for `Waker` from `Arc<dyn Wake>`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Wake trait was left out of the initial version of the task waker API.\r\n\r\nHowever, as Rust 1.41, it is possible under the more flexible orphan rules to implement `From<Arc<W>> for Waker where W: Wake` in liballoc. Therefore, we can now define this constructor even though `Waker` lives in libcore.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds these APIs:\r\n\r\n- A `Wake` trait, which contains two methods\r\n    - A required method `wake`, which is called by `Waker::wake`\r\n    - A provided method `wake_by_ref`, which is called by `Waker::wake_by_ref` and which implementors can override if they can optimize this use case.\r\n- An implementation of `From<Arc<W>> for Waker where W: Wake + Send + Sync + 'static`\r\n- A similar implementation of `From<Arc<W>> for RawWaker`.", "created_at": "2020-01-31T13:36:35Z", "updated_at": "2020-03-23T22:03:02Z", "closed_at": "2020-03-23T22:03:02Z", "merged_at": "2020-03-23T22:03:02Z", "merge_commit_sha": "e4d2f747e56e52cbd4ee90222fb455c6488ba683", "assignee": {"login": "cramertj", "id": 5963049, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU5NjMwNDk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5963049?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj", "html_url": "https://github.com/cramertj", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "cramertj", "id": 5963049, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU5NjMwNDk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5963049?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj", "html_url": "https://github.com/cramertj", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cramertj/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 211668062, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgwNjI=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-libs-api", "name": "T-libs-api", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the library API team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
