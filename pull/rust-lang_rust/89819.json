In single mode, sections which did not require relocation were written into object files but ignored by the linker and were not packaged. However, both split and single modes could be packaged or not, the primary difference in behaviour was where the debuginfo sections that did not require link-time relocation were written (in a DWARF object or the object file).\r\n\r\n  In the first commit of this PR, I re-introduce a `-Z split-dwarf-kind` flag, which can be used to pick between split and single modes when `-C split-debuginfo` is used to enable Split DWARF (either packed or unpacked).\r\n- Split DWARF packaging requires all of the object files to exist, including those in dependencies. ~~Therefore, the second commit of this PR makes rustc keep all objects or dwarf objects for unpacked mode and if the crate is a dependency in packed mode (determined by heuristic: if no linking is taking place), then objects or dwarf objects are kept. Objects are kept if `-Z split-dwarf-kind` is `SplitDwarfKind::Single`, and dwarf objects if `SplitDwarfKind::Split`.~~\r\n\r\n  ~~There are other approaches that could be taken to supporting packed Split DWARF with crate dependencies but this seemed like the least complicated and was contained to only rustc. Other potential approaches are described in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81024#issuecomment-760478223, I'm happy to change the approach I've taken here if it isn't what we're looking for.~~ See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89819#issuecomment-985671867 for the current approach.\r\n- ~~There's still a dependency on `llvm-dwp` after this change, which [we probably want to move away from](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/llvm-dwp.20is.20not.20recommended) but that seems out-of-scope for this PR. Ideally, Split DWARF (in packed or unpacked modes) will be usable on nightly after this lands. If there aren't any bugs reported then it's possible we could allow Split DWARF to be used on stable after this change, it depends whether or not switching away from `llvm-dwp` later would break any guarantees, or whether we'd want to change how we handle this cross-crate case in future.~~ See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89819#issuecomment-985671867.\r\n\r\nr? @nagisa\r\ncc @alexcrichton", "created_at": "2021-10-12T13:38:32Z", "updated_at": "2022-01-06T18:09:58Z", "closed_at": "2022-01-06T15:30:53Z", "merged_at": "2022-01-06T15:30:53Z", "merge_commit_sha": "a77cc64af491a31db224109a76b9b81cd26cd07c", "assignee": {"login": "nagisa", "id": 679122, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTEyMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/679122?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa", "html_url": "https://github.com/nagisa", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "nagisa", "id": 679122, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTEyMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/679122?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa", "html_url": "https://github.com/nagisa", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 211668100, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgxMDA=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-compiler", "name": "T-compiler", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the compiler team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
