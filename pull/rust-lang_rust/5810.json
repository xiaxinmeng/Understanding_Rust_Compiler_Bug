It requires that the container is frozen so there's no worry about invalidating them.\n\nAdvantages over internal iterators, which are functions that are passed closures and directly implement the iteration protocol:\n- Iteration is stateful, so you can interleave iteration over arbitrary containers. That's needed to implement algorithms like zip, merge, set union, set intersection, set difference and symmetric difference. I already used this internally in the `TreeMap` and `TreeSet` implementations, but regions and traits weren't solid enough to make it generic yet.\n- They provide a universal, generic interface. The same trait is used for a forward/reverse iterator, an iterator over a range, etc. Internal iterators end up resulting in a trait for each possible way you could iterate.\n- They can be composed with adaptors like `ZipIterator`, which also implement the same trait themselves.\n\nThe disadvantage is that they're a pain to write without support from the compiler for compiling something like `yield` to a state machine. :)\n\nThis can coexist alongside internal iterators since both can use the current `for` protocol. It's easier to write an internal iterator, but external ones are far more powerful/useful so they should probably be provided whenever possible by the standard library.\n## Current issues\n#5801 is somewhat annoying since explicit type hints are required.\n\nI just wanted to get the essentials working well, so I haven't put much thought into making the naming concise (free functions vs. static `new` methods, etc.).\n\nMaking an `Iterable` trait seems like it will have to be a long-term goal, requiring type system extensions. At least without resorting to objects which would probably be unacceptably slow.\n", "created_at": "2013-04-10T00:30:33Z", "updated_at": "2014-06-13T10:39:33Z", "closed_at": "2013-04-13T22:39:55Z",
