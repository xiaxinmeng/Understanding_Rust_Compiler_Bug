The problem is that a Path may contain non-UTF-8 data on most platforms. In the implementation of the RFC, a `display` method was added, which returns an adapter that implements `Display` by replacing non-UTF8 data with a unicode replacement character.\r\n\r\nThough I can't find a record of the discussion around this issue, I believe there were two primary reasons not to just implement this behavior as the `Display` impl of `Path`:\r\n\r\n1. The adapter allocated in the non-UTF8 case, and Rust as a rule tries to avoid allocations that are not explicit in code.\r\n2. The user may prefer an alternative solution than using the unicode replacement character for handling non-UTF8 data.\r\n\r\nIn my view, the choice to provide an adapter rather than implement Display has had a high cost in terms of user experience:\r\n\r\n* I almost never remember that I need an adapter, forcing me to go back and edit my code after compiling it and getting an error.\r\n* It makes my code more noisy to have the display adapter; this detail is rarely important.\r\n* It is extremely uncommon to actually do something other than call the display adapter when trying to display a path (I have never wanted anything else myself).\r\n* For new users, it is Yet Another Compiler Error that they have to figure out how to solve, contributing to the sense that Rust nags and obstructs rather than assists & guides.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think time has shown that this has been a detriment to user experience, rather than a helpful reminder. That leaves only the first reason not to implement this: implicit allocations. That problem was happily resolved in June 2017: #42613 provided an alternative implementation which efficiently avoids allocations.\r\n\r\nGiven that, I think it is time that we implement `Display` for both `Path` and `PathBuf` and deprecate the `Path::display` method.\r\n\r\nr? @alexcrichton\r\ncc @rust-lang/libs\r\n\r\n[rfc474]:
