It uses two futexes: One for the readers to wait on, and one for the writers to wait on. The readers futex contains the state of the RwLock: The number of readers, a bit indicating whether writers are waiting, and a bit indicating whether readers are waiting. The writers futex is used as a simple condition variable and its contents are meaningless; it just needs to be changed on every notification.\r\n\r\nUsing two futexes rather than one has the obvious advantage of allowing a separate queue for readers and writers, but it also means we avoid the problem a single-futex RwLock would have of making it hard for a writer to go to sleep while the number of readers is rapidly changing up and down, as the writers futex is only changed when we actually want to wake up a writer.\r\n\r\nIt always prefers writers, as we decided [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/93740#issuecomment-1070696128).\r\n\r\nTo be able to prefer writers, it relies on futex_wake to return the number of awoken threads to be able to handle write-unlocking while both the readers-waiting and writers-waiting bits are set. Instead of waking both and letting them race, it first wakes writers and only continues to wake the readers too if futex_wake reported there were no writers to wake up.\r\n\r\nr? @Amanieu", "created_at": "2022-04-08T12:09:13Z", "updated_at": "2022-08-30T11:02:44Z", "closed_at": "2022-04-12T00:18:52Z", "merged_at": "2022-04-12T00:18:51Z", "merge_commit_sha": "a15ac301627b33f87ca6f166b7cdbcc453543ee3", "assignee": {"login": "Amanieu", "id": 278509, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODUwOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/278509?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu", "html_url": "https://github.com/Amanieu", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "Amanieu", "id": 278509, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODUwOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/278509?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu", "html_url": "https://github.com/Amanieu", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 123110, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMxMTA=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/O-linux", "name": "O-linux", "color": "6e6ec0", "default": false, "description": "Operating system: Linux"}, {"id": 9695584, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw5Njk1NTg0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/A-concurrency", "name": "A-concurrency", "color": "f7e101", "default": false, "description": "Area: Concurrency related issues."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
