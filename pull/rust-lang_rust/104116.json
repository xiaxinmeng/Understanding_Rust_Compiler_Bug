Fundamentally it uses optimal sorting networks to speedup sorting small slices. Before going into too much detail on the speedup, the most important thing is correctness. It passes my test suite in https://github.com/Voultapher/sort-research-rs both with normal Rust and Miri. That includes tests not found or not found with the same rigor in the standard library tests, `observable_is_less`, `panic_retain_original_set` and `violate_ord_retain_original_set`. And from a code structure point, it copies several elements from `slice::sort`. They live in separate modules, and I don't know enough about the structure of the standard library to unify them. In essence I could image them both living in core and stable sorting requiring a passed in function that does the allocation. But even then I'm not sure how that affects LTO and inlining, which are critical for performance. In my repository I have all the implementations copied into individual modules, and I'm not sure how to test that in the standard library.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSpeedups:\r\n\r\n- 1.2-1.5x faster than existing implementation for random, saw and other patterns (integers)\r\n- Same performance for very densely distributed random inputs and ascending and descending inputs, len >= 40.\r\n- On average fewer comparisons for types that are judged cheap to move\r\n- Near perfect sorting of descending inputs starting from size 8.\r\n\r\nTo understand this PR, it's advisable to read https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100856. There I go into more detail on the test methodology and graphs.\r\n\r\nThe full benchmark results can be found here: https://voultapher.github.io/sort-research-rs/results/e746538/\r\n\r\nHere are the speedups and slowdowns for Zen3:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"604\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6864584/200372807-a464b4b1-5bb2-4f91-8eb9-dc9d523f1a8b.png\">\r\n\r\nFor hot-u64 we can see that the speedups are the most extreme for smaller sizes and level out at 30%.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"604\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6864584/200373101-f2a3e498-61c4-464f-98f2-3da27be0bab7.png\">\r\n\r\nFor hot-string which is relatively expensive to access we see it level out at 4% while seeing 10-15% speedup for smaller sizes, and 3x speedup as the most extreme case hot-string-descending-20. These results are in-line with the average reduced comparison counts and the extreme speedups are explained by the ability to detect fully or mostly decreasing inputs even for small inputs. For smaller sizes there are also a noticeable amount of slowdowns. I'd argue that the overall speedup is worth it here, but this can be tuned with the `qualifies_for_branchless_sort` heuristic.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"604\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6864584/200373315-6c3cc025-fcde-44ce-804d-96bb8620fff7.png\">\r\n\r\nThe 1k type generally produces the most noisy results, so I'm not sure this is a real signal. But it might be thanks to the tuned insert right and left functions.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"604\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6864584/200373195-f5fc73f4-7ea3-459f-b2c9-2dec98414875.png\">\r\n\r\nThe cheap to access but expensive to compare type f128 shows a modest speedup of 10-20%, with descending inputs again showing the largest outliers at a 5x speedup for descending-20, which switches from insertion sort to the more sophisticated `sort_small`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"604\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6864584/200373390-2e39b431-2eaa-4b45-8b43-9d63d7abe072.png\">\r\n\r\nThe cold results don't look too *hot* for small sizes <= 20, these could be addressed by adding extra logic. But even then it's a tricky balance, where something like pattern analysis is really hard if not impossible to do without some slowdown for cold code. Also note, I'm not too sure about the my methodology for cold code here.\r\n\r\nThe speedups and slowdowns for Firestorm are relatively similar:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"604\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6864584/200372940-e5b40a3d-722f-4cf7-aa70-414c07b9f757.png\">\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nComparison statistics.\r\n\r\n```\r\nPercent comparisons done more by rust_new_unstable than rust_std_unstable\r\n[i32-ascending-20-plus]:              mean: -2%     min: -13%  max: 0%\r\n[i32-ascending-20-sub]:               mean: 14%     min: 0%    max: 67%\r\n[i32-ascending_saw_20-20-plus]:       mean: -7%     min: -19%  max: -2%\r\n[i32-ascending_saw_20-20-sub]:        mean: 14%     min: 0%    max: 67%\r\n[i32-ascending_saw_5-20-plus]:        mean: -8%     min: -24%  max: -3%\r\n[i32-ascending_saw_5-20-sub]:         mean: 13%     min: -11%  max: 67%\r\n[i32-descending-20-plus]:             mean: -47%    min: -240% max: 0%\r\n[i32-descending-20-sub]:              mean: -396%   min: -900% max: 0%\r\n[i32-descending_saw_20-20-plus]:      mean: -54%    min: -240% max: -3%\r\n[i32-descending_saw_20-20-sub]:       mean: -396%   min: -900% max: 0%\r\n[i32-descending_saw_5-20-plus]:       mean: -6%     min: -22%  max: -1%\r\n[i32-descending_saw_5-20-sub]:        mean: -74%    min: -350% max: 0%\r\n[i32-pipe_organ-20-plus]:             mean: -27%    min: -64%  max: -6%\r\n[i32-pipe_organ-20-sub]:              mean: -54%    min: -143% max: 18%\r\n[i32-random-20-plus]:                 mean: -6%     min: -14%  max: -3%\r\n[i32-random-20-sub]:                  mean: -8%     min: -34%  max: 25%\r\n[i32-random_binary-20-plus]:          mean: 13%     min: -13%  max: 85%\r\n[i32-random_binary-20-sub]:           mean: 22%     min: 0%    max: 62%\r\n[i32-random_dense-20-plus]:           mean: 7%      min: 0%    max: 35%\r\n[i32-random_dense-20-sub]:            mean: 4%      min: -15%  max: 31%\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith some exceptions, overall we see a nice average reduction of comparisons. That's the reasons why I tuned `qualifies_for_branchless_sort` to allow all types except those that are deemed expensive to move.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBinary bloat.\r\n\r\nCompiling a simple hello world and sorting 6 different integer types and 2 different String containers, in release mode and stripping the binary yields:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBaseline:            300k\r\nrust_std_unstable:   379k\r\nrust_new_unstable:   425k\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhy is this faster?\r\n\r\nModer hardware is so complex that all I can do is guess, but in essence if you look at the assembly call graph of `insertion_sort_shift_left`:\r\n\r\n![insertion-sort-assembly](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6864584/200373438-1d2725aa-d1a1-4172-81fa-30a9597d5580.png)\r\nmbly\r\n\r\nAnd compare that to `sort8_optimal`:\r\n\r\n![sort8-assembly](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6864584/200373463-f8eb531f-3a08-4248-a7ac-e5a43e6b4a28.png)\r\n\r\nIt might seem clear, why the `sort8_optimal` and it's siblings are able to extract more Instruction-Level-Parallelism (ILP) than insertion sort which is currently being used.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is, that pdqsort spends a *lot* of time in insertion sort:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"604\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6864584/200373619-4fa69557-bab2-46e4-adb2-a0e3a8446f79.png\">\r\n\r\nSo it's worthwhile to speed up this area. The kind of optimizations pdqsort does to avoid choosing a bad pivot or even switching to heapsort make a lot of sense at larger sizes, but are overkill for smaller sizes. Which are better addressed with something tailormade like `sort_small`.", "created_at": "2022-11-07T17:24:12Z", "updated_at": "2023-01-26T07:56:57Z", "closed_at": "2023-01-26T07:56:56Z", "merged_at":
