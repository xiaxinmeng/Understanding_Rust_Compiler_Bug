This has lead to a [CVE for `ripgrep`](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-3013) but presumably other command line utilities could be similarly vulnerable if they run commands. This was [discussed on the internals forum](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/std-command-resolve-to-avoid-security-issues-on-windows/14800). Also discussed was [which directories should be searched](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/windows-where-should-command-new-look-for-executables/15015).\r\n\r\nEDIT: This PR originally removed all implicit paths. They've now been added back as laid out in the rest of this comment.\r\n\r\n## Old Search Strategy\r\n\r\nThe old search strategy is [documented here][1]. Additionally Rust adds searching the child's paths (see also #37519). So the full list of paths that were searched was:\r\n\r\n1. The directories that are listed in the child's `PATH` environment variable.\r\n2. The directory from which the application loaded.\r\n3. The current directory for the parent process.\r\n4. The 32-bit Windows system directory.\r\n5. The 16-bit Windows system directory.\r\n6. The Windows directory.\r\n7. The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.\r\n\r\n## New Search Strategy\r\n\r\nThe new strategy removes the current directory from the searched paths.\r\n\r\n1. The directories that are listed in the child's PATH environment variable.\r\n2. The directory from which the application loaded.\r\n3. The 32-bit Windows system directory.\r\n4. The Windows directory.\r\n5. The directories that are listed in the parent's PATH environment variable.\r\n\r\nNote that it also removes the 16-bit system directory, mostly because there isn't a function to get it. I do not anticipate this being an issue in modern Windows.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\nRemoving the current directory should fix CVE's like the one linked above. However, it's possible some Windows users of affected Rust CLI applications have come to expect the old behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis change could also affect small Windows-only script-like programs that assumed the current directory would be used. The user would need to use `.\\file.exe` instead of the bare application name.\r\n\r\nThis PR could break tests, especially those that test the exact output of error messages (e.g. Cargo) as this does change the error messages is some cases.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa#parameters", "created_at": "2021-08-02T16:08:29Z", "updated_at": "2021-11-24T08:52:39Z", "closed_at": "2021-11-20T21:37:57Z", "merged_at": "2021-11-20T21:37:56Z", "merge_commit_sha": "2885c474823637ae69c5967327327a337aebedb2", "assignee": {"login": "dtolnay", "id": 1940490, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDA0OTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1940490?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay", "html_url": "https://github.com/dtolnay", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "dtolnay", "id": 1940490, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDA0OTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1940490?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay", "html_url": "https://github.com/dtolnay", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 123109, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMxMDk=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/O-windows", "name": "O-windows", "color": "6e6ec0", "default": false, "description": "Operating system: Windows"}, {"id": 211668062, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgwNjI=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-libs-api", "name": "T-libs-api", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the library API team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 223796632, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMjM3OTY2MzI=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/relnotes", "name": "relnotes", "color": "fad8c7", "default": false, "description": "Marks issues that should be documented in the release notes of the next release."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
