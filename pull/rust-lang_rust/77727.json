There are several versions of this function in the godbolt:\r\n\r\n- `info_new`: version in the current patch\r\n- `info_less_new`: version in initial PR\r\n- `info_original`: version currently in the tree\r\n- `info_orig_but_better_orderings`: a version that just tries to change the original code's orderings from SeqCst to the (probably) minimal orderings required for soundness/correctness.\r\n\r\nThe biggest concern I have here is if we can use AtomicU64, or if there are targets that dont have it that this code supports. AFAICT: no. (If that changes in the future, it's easy enough to do something different for them)\r\n\r\nr? @Amanieu because he caught a couple issues last time I tried to do a patch reducing orderings \ud83d\ude05\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>I rewrote this whole message so the original is inside here</summary>\r\n\r\nI happened to notice the code we use for caching the result of mach_timebase_info uses SeqCst exclusively.\r\n\r\nHowever, thinking a little more, it's actually pretty easy to avoid the static mut by packing the timebase info into an AtomicU64.\r\n\r\nThis entirely avoids needing to do the compare_exchange. The AtomicU64 can be read/written using Relaxed ops, which on current macos/ios platforms (x86_64/aarch64) have no overhead compared to direct loads/stores. This simplifies the code and makes it a lot safer too.\r\n\r\nI have no numbers to prove that this improves performance (It seems a little futile to benchmark something like this), although it should do that on both targets it applies to.\r\n\r\nThat said, it also removes a bunch of unsafe code and simplifies the logic (arguably at least \u2014 there are only two states now, initialized or not), so I think it's a net win even without concrete numbers.\r\n\r\nIf you want to take a look at the assembly output though, see below. It has the new version, the original, and a version of the original with lower Orderings (which is still worse than the version in this PR)\r\n\r\n- godbolt.org/z/obfqf9 x86_64-apple-darwin\r\n\r\n- godbolt.org/z/Wz5cWc aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu (godbolt can't do aarch64-apple-ios but that doesn't matter here)\r\n\r\nA different (and more efficient) option than this would be to just use the AtomicU64 and use the knowledge that after initialization the denominator should be nonzero... That felt like it's relying on too many things I'm not confident in, so I didn't want to do that.\r\n</details>", "created_at": "2020-10-08T22:04:09Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-11T15:57:14Z", "closed_at": "2020-10-11T15:57:10Z", "merged_at": "2020-10-11T15:57:10Z", "merge_commit_sha": "bc74dd711fd154555dea3b110dfed39c4dc37bc6", "assignee": {"login": "Amanieu", "id": 278509, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODUwOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/278509?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu", "html_url": "https://github.com/Amanieu", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "Amanieu", "id": 278509, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODUwOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/278509?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu", "html_url": "https://github.com/Amanieu", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 113376, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMTMzNzY=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/I-slow", "name": "I-slow", "color": "e10c02", "default": false, "description": "Problems and improvements with respect to performance of generated code."}, {"id": 211668062, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgwNjI=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-libs-api", "name": "T-libs-api", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the library API team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
