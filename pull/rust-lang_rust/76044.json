It extends the current dataflow framework to work with arbitrary lattices, not just `BitSet`s. This is a prerequisite for dataflow-enabled MIR const-propagation. Personally, I am skeptical of the usefulness of doing const-propagation pre-monomorphization, since many useful constants only become known after monomorphization (e.g. `size_of::<T>()`) and users have a natural tendency to hand-optimize the rest. It's probably worth exprimenting with, however, and others have shown interest cc @rust-lang/wg-mir-opt.\r\n\r\nThe `Idx` associated type is moved from `AnalysisDomain` to `GenKillAnalysis` and replaced with an associated `Domain` type that must implement `JoinSemiLattice`. Like before, each `Analysis` defines the \"bottom value\" for its domain, but can no longer override the dataflow join operator. Analyses that want to use set intersection must now use the `lattice::Dual` newtype. `GenKillAnalysis` impls have an additional requirement that `Self::Domain: BorrowMut<BitSet<Self::Idx>>`, which effectively means that they must use `BitSet<Self::Idx>` or `lattice::Dual<BitSet<Self::Idx>>` as their domain.\r\n\r\nMost of these changes were mechanical. However, because a `Domain` is no longer always a powerset of some index type, we can no longer use an `IndexVec<BasicBlock, GenKillSet<A::Idx>>>` to store cached block transfer functions. Instead, we use a boxed `dyn Fn` trait object. I discuss a few alternatives to the current approach in a commit message.\r\n\r\nThe majority of new lines of code are to preserve existing Graphviz diagrams for those unlucky enough to have to debug dataflow analyses. I find these diagrams incredibly useful when things are going wrong and considered regressing them unacceptable, especially the pretty-printing of `MovePathIndex`s, which are used in many dataflow analyses. This required a parallel `fmt` trait used only for printing dataflow domains, as well as a refactoring of the `graphviz` module now that we cannot expect the domain to be a `BitSet`. Some features did have to be removed, such as the gen/kill display mode (which I didn't use but existed to mirror the output of the old dataflow framework) and line wrapping. Since I had to rewrite much of it anyway, I took the opportunity to switch to a `Visitor` for printing dataflow state diffs instead of using cursors, which are error prone for code that must be generic over both forward and backward analyses. As a side-effect of this change, we no longer have quadratic behavior when writing graphviz diagrams for backward dataflow analyses.\r\n\r\nr? @pnkfelix", "created_at": "2020-08-28T23:31:29Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-06T01:42:17Z", "closed_at": "2020-09-07T23:43:28Z", "merged_at": "2020-09-07T23:43:28Z", "merge_commit_sha": "0e2c1281e909ca38479b97962fc9248f75d66412", "assignee": {"login": "pnkfelix", "id": 173127, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173127?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix", "html_url": "https://github.com/pnkfelix", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "pnkfelix", "id": 173127, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173127?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix", "html_url": "https://github.com/pnkfelix", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
