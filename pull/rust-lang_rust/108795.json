Targets should normally use the same names and\r\n>   naming conventions as used elsewhere in the broader ecosystem beyond Rust\r\n>   (such as in other toolchains), unless they have a very good reason to\r\n>   diverge. Changing the name of a target can be highly disruptive, especially\r\n>   once the target reaches a higher tier, so getting the name right is important\r\n>   even for a tier 3 target.\r\n\r\nThis uses the same naming conventions used for the other macOS targets (`-apple-darwin`), combined with the convention used by LLVM for the `x86_64h` targets. LLVM's convention matches the architecture name used when invoking various tools such as `lipo`, `arch`, and (IMO) there's not really a compelling reason to depart from it.\r\n\r\n> - Target names should not introduce undue confusion or ambiguity unless\r\n>   absolutely necessary to maintain ecosystem compatibility. For example, if\r\n>   the name of the target makes people extremely likely to form incorrect\r\n>   beliefs about what it targets, the name should be changed or augmented to\r\n>   disambiguate it.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is especially likely, although I suppose someone could mistake it for `x86_64-apple-darwin`.\r\n\r\n> - If possible, use only letters, numbers, dashes and underscores for the name.\r\n>   Periods (`.`) are known to cause issues in Cargo.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc4d\r\n\r\n> - Tier 3 targets may have unusual requirements to build or use, but must not\r\n>   create legal issues or impose onerous legal terms for the Rust project or for\r\n>   Rust developers or users.\r\n>   - The target must not introduce license incompatibilities.\r\n\r\nIt does not.\r\n\r\n> - Anything added to the Rust repository must be under the standard Rust\r\n>   license (`MIT OR Apache-2.0`).\r\n\r\nIt is.\r\n\r\n> - The target must not cause the Rust tools or libraries built for any other\r\n>   host (even when supporting cross-compilation to the target) to depend\r\n>   on any new dependency less permissive than the Rust licensing policy. This\r\n>   applies whether the dependency is a Rust crate that would require adding\r\n>   new license exceptions (as specified by the `tidy` tool in the\r\n>   rust-lang/rust repository), or whether the dependency is a native library\r\n>   or binary. In other words, the introduction of the target must not cause a\r\n>   user installing or running a version of Rust or the Rust tools to be\r\n>   subject to any new license requirements.\r\n\r\nThere are no new dependencies that don't also apply to `x86_64-apple-darwin`.\r\n\r\n> - Compiling, linking, and emitting functional binaries, libraries, or other\r\n>   code for the target (whether hosted on the target itself or cross-compiling\r\n>   from another target) must not depend on proprietary (non-FOSS) libraries.\r\n>   Host tools built for the target itself may depend on the ordinary runtime\r\n>   libraries supplied by the platform and commonly used by other applications\r\n>   built for the target, but those libraries must not be required for code\r\n>   generation for the target; cross-compilation to the target must not require\r\n>   such libraries at all. For instance, `rustc` built for the target may\r\n>   depend on a common proprietary C runtime library or console output library,\r\n>   but must not depend on a proprietary code generation library or code\r\n>   optimization library. Rust's license permits such combinations, but the\r\n>   Rust project has no interest in maintaining such combinations within the\r\n>   scope of Rust itself, even at tier 3.\r\n\r\nThis has the same requirements as the other macOS targets (e.g. `x86_64-apple-darwin` and similar).\r\n\r\n> - \"onerous\" here is an intentionally subjective term. At a minimum, \"onerous\"\r\n>   legal/licensing terms include but are *not* limited to: non-disclosure\r\n>   requirements, non-compete requirements, contributor license agreements\r\n>   (CLAs) or equivalent, \"non-commercial\"/\"research-only\"/etc terms,\r\n>   requirements conditional on the employer or employment of any particular\r\n>   Rust developers, revocable terms, any requirements that create liability\r\n>   for the Rust project or its developers or users, or any requirements that\r\n>   adversely affect the livelihood or prospects of the Rust project or its\r\n>   developers or users.\r\n\r\nNo change here.\r\n\r\n> - Neither this policy nor any decisions made regarding targets shall create any\r\n>   binding agreement or estoppel by any party. If any member of an approving\r\n>   Rust team serves as one of the maintainers of a target, or has any legal or\r\n>   employment requirement (explicit or implicit) that might affect their\r\n>   decisions regarding a target, they must recuse themselves from any approval\r\n>   decisions regarding the target's tier status, though they may otherwise\r\n>   participate in discussions.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc4d\r\n\r\n> - This requirement does not prevent part or all of this policy from being\r\n>   cited in an explicit contract or work agreement (e.g. to implement or\r\n>   maintain support for a target). This requirement exists to ensure that a\r\n>   developer or team responsible for reviewing and approving a target does not\r\n>   face any legal threats or obligations that would prevent them from freely\r\n>   exercising their judgment in such approval, even if such judgment involves\r\n>   subjective matters or goes beyond the letter of these requirements.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc4d\r\n\r\n> - Tier 3 targets should attempt to implement as much of the standard libraries\r\n>   as possible and appropriate (`core` for most targets, `alloc` for targets\r\n>   that can support dynamic memory allocation, `std` for targets with an\r\n>   operating system or equivalent layer of system-provided functionality), but\r\n>   may leave some code unimplemented (either unavailable or stubbed out as\r\n>   appropriate), whether because the target makes it impossible to implement or\r\n>   challenging to implement. The authors of pull requests are not obligated to\r\n>   avoid calling any portions of the standard library on the basis of a tier 3\r\n>   target not implementing those portions.\r\n\r\nThe standard library tests seem to pass.\r\n\r\n> - The target must provide documentation for the Rust community explaining how\r\n>   to build for the target, using cross-compilation if possible. If the target\r\n>   supports running binaries, or running tests (even if they do not pass), the\r\n>   documentation must explain how to run such binaries or tests for the target,\r\n>   using emulation if possible or dedicated hardware if necessary.\r\n\r\nDocumentation is provided.\r\n\r\n> - Tier 3 targets must not impose burden on the authors of pull requests, or\r\n>   other developers in the community, to maintain the target. In particular,\r\n>   do not post comments (automated or manual) on a PR that derail or suggest a\r\n>   block on the PR based on a tier 3 target. Do not send automated messages or\r\n>   notifications (via any medium, including via `@`) to a PR author or others\r\n>   involved with a PR regarding a tier 3 target, unless they have opted into\r\n>   such messages.\r\n\r\nNoted. This target is nearly identical to `x86_64-apple-darwin`, so this is\r\nunlikely to cause issues anyway.\r\n\r\n> - Backlinks such as those generated by the issue/PR tracker when linking to\r\n>   an issue or PR are not considered a violation of this policy, within\r\n>   reason. However, such messages (even on a separate repository) must not\r\n>   generate notifications to anyone involved with a PR who has not requested\r\n>   such notifications.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc4d\r\n\r\n> - Patches adding or updating tier 3 targets must not break any existing tier 2\r\n>   or tier 1 target, and must not knowingly break another tier 3 target without\r\n>   approval of either the compiler team or the maintainers of the other tier 3\r\n>   target.\r\n>   - In particular, this may come up when working on closely related targets,\r\n>     such as variations of the same architecture with different features. Avoid\r\n>     introducing unconditional uses of features that another variation of the\r\n>     target may not have; use conditional compilation or runtime detection, as\r\n>     appropriate, to let each target run code supported by that target.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc4d\r\n", "created_at": "2023-03-06T00:52:18Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-20T19:35:52Z", "closed_at": "2023-04-20T19:35:47Z", "merged_at": "2023-04-20T19:35:47Z", "merge_commit_sha": "7dc211f5cede0a515d7a00bf7f3f908ce97e861c", "assignee": {"login": "oli-obk", "id": 332036, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAzNg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332036?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk", "html_url": "https://github.com/oli-obk", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "oli-obk", "id": 332036, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAzNg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332036?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk", "html_url": "https://github.com/oli-obk", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 123111, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMxMTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/O-macos", "name": "O-macos", "color": "6e6ec0", "default": false, "description": "Operating system: macOS"}, {"id": 211668100, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgxMDA=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-compiler", "name": "T-compiler", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the compiler team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
