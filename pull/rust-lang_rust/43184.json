In all cases, we use the same basic \"memoization\" strategy: \r\n\r\n- Store the `DepNodeIndex` in the slot along with value.\r\n- If value is present, return it, and add a read of the dep-node-index.\r\n- Else, start an anonymous task, and store resulting node.\r\n\r\nWe apply this strategy to a number of caches in trait selection:\r\n\r\n- The \"trans\" caches of selection and projection\r\n- The \"evaluation\" cache\r\n- The \"candidate selection\" cache\r\n\r\nIn general, for our cache strategy to be \"dep-correct\", the computation of the value is permitted to rely on the *value in the key* but nothing else. The basic argument is this: in order to look something up, you have to produce the key, and to do that you must have whatever reads were needed to create the key. Then, you get whatever reads were further needed to produce the value. But if the \"closure\" that produced the value made use of *other* environmental data, not derivable from the key, that would be bad -- but that would **also** suggest that the cache is messed up (though it's not proof).\r\n\r\nThe structure of these caches do not obviously prove that the correctness criteria are met, and I aim to address that in further refactorings. But I *believe* it to be the case that, if we assume that the existing caches are correct, there are also no dependency failures (in other words, if there's a bug, it's a pre-existing one). Specifically:\r\n\r\n- The trans caches: these take as input just a `tcx`, which is \"by definition\" not leaky, the `trait-ref` etc, which is part of the key, and sometimes a span (doesn't influence the result). So they seem fine.\r\n- The evaluation cache:\r\n    - This computation takes as input the \"stack\" and has access to the infcx.\r\n    - The infcx is a problem -- would be better to take the tcx -- and this is exactly one of the things I plan to improve in later PRs. Let's ignore it for now. =)\r\n    - The stack itself is also not great, in that the *key* only consists of the top-entry in the stack.\r\n    - However, the stack can cause a problem in two ways:\r\n        - overflow (we panic)\r\n        - cycle check fails (we do not update the cache, I believe)\r\n- The candidate selection cache: \r\n    - as before, takes the \"stack\" and has access to the infcx.\r\n    - here it is not as obvious that we avoid caching stack-dependent computations. However, to the extent that we do, this is a pre-existing bug, in that we are making cache entries we shouldn't. \r\n    - I aim to resolve this by -- following the chalk-style of evaluation -- merging candidate selection and evaluation. \r\n    - The infcx is a problem -- would be better to take the tcx -- and this is exactly one of the things I plan to improve in later PRs. Let's ignore it for now. =)\r\n    - The stack itself is also not great, in that the *key* only consists of the top-entry in the stack.\r\n    - Moreover, the stack would generally just introduce ambiguities and errors anyhow, so that lessens the risk.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the existing approach to handle dependencies in the trait code carries the same risks or worse, so this seems like a strict improvement!\r\n\r\nr? @michaelwoerister \r\n\r\ncc @arielb1 ", "created_at": "2017-07-12T16:08:25Z", "updated_at": "2017-08-13T03:02:18Z", "closed_at": "2017-07-15T04:47:15Z", "merged_at":
