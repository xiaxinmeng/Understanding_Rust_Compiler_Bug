Running a stage2 compile and the rustc-perf suite takes hours on the hardware I have at the moment, so I can't do much more than that.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_2020-04-05 rustc performance data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1065730/78462657-5d60f100-76d4-11ea-8a0b-4f3962707c38.png)\r\n\r\nIn the best case of the `vec::bench_in_place_recycle` synthetic microbenchmark these optimizations can provide a 15x speedup over the regular implementation which allocates a new vec for every benchmark iteration. [Benchmark results](https://gist.github.com/the8472/6d999b2d08a2bedf3b93f12112f96e2f). In real code the speedups are tiny, but it also depends on the allocator used, a system allocator that uses a process-wide mutex will benefit more than one with thread-local pools.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What was changed\r\n\r\n* `SpecExtend` which covered `from_iter` and `extend` specializations was split into separate traits\r\n* `extend` and `from_iter` now reuse the `append_elements` if passed iterators are from slices.\r\n* A preexisting `vec.into_iter().collect::<Vec<_>>()` optimization that passed through the original vec has been generalized further to also cover cases where the original has been partially drained.\r\n* A chain of *Vec<T> / BinaryHeap<T> / Box<[T]>* `IntoIter`s  through various iterator adapters collected into *Vec<U>* and *BinaryHeap<U>* will be performed in place as long as `T` and `U` have the same alignment and size and aren't ZSTs.\r\n* To enable above specialization the unsafe, unstable `SourceIter` and `InPlaceIterable` traits have been added. The first allows reaching through the iterator pipeline to grab a pointer to the source memory. The latter is a marker that promises that the read pointer will advance as fast or faster than the write pointer and thus in-place operation is possible in the first place.\r\n* `vec::IntoIter` implements `TrustedRandomAccess` for `T: Copy` to allow in-place collection when there is a `Zip` adapter in the iterator. TRA had to be made an unstable public trait to support this.\r\n\r\n\r\n## In-place collectible adapters\r\n\r\n* `Map`\r\n* `MapWhile`\r\n* `Filter`\r\n* `FilterMap`\r\n* `Fuse`\r\n* `Skip`\r\n* `SkipWhile`\r\n* `Take`\r\n* `TakeWhile`\r\n* `Enumerate`\r\n* `Zip` (left hand side only, `Copy` types only)\r\n* `Peek`\r\n* `Scan`\r\n* `Inspect`\r\n\r\n## Concerns\r\n\r\n`vec.into_iter().filter(|_| false).collect()` will no longer return a vec with 0 capacity, instead it will return its original allocation. This avoids the cost of doing any allocation or deallocation but could lead to large allocations living longer than expected.\r\nIf that's not acceptable some resizing policy at the end of the attempted in-place collect would be necessary, which in the worst case could result in one more memcopy than the non-specialized case.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Possible followup work\r\n\r\n* split liballoc/vec.rs to remove `ignore-tidy-filelength`\r\n* try to get trivial chains such as `vec.into_iter().skip(1).collect::<Vec<)>>()` to compile to a `memmove` (currently compiles to a pile of SIMD, see #69187 )\r\n* improve up the traits so they can be reused by other crates, e.g. itertools. I think currently they're only good enough for internal use\r\n* allow iterators sourced from a `HashSet` to be in-place collected into a `Vec`\r\n", "created_at": "2020-04-04T23:30:23Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-26T15:16:57Z", "closed_at": "2020-09-03T23:29:27Z", "merged_at": "2020-09-03T23:29:27Z", "merge_commit_sha": "0d0f6b113047b2cf9afbde990cee30fd5b866469", "assignee": {"login": "Amanieu", "id": 278509, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODUwOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/278509?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu", "html_url": "https://github.com/Amanieu", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "Amanieu", "id": 278509, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODUwOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/278509?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu", "html_url": "https://github.com/Amanieu", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
