I've had this idea knocking around for a while of adding f-strings. I apologize for not going through the proper RFC process, but I thought it would be easier to get it working first and see what people thought informally, before going through that.\r\n\r\nDemo:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet a = \"test\";\r\nlet b = \"spam\";\r\nlet text = f\"Hello {a} {b}! {5 * 4 + 22}\";\r\nassert_eq!(text, \"Hello test spam! 42\");\r\n\r\nlet nested = f\"foo { f\"bar { f\"baz { f\"quux: {9 * 9}!\" }\" }\" }\";\r\nassert_eq!(nested, \"foo bar baz quux: 81!\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of unresolved issues that I'd really appreciate feedback on!\r\n- I've chosen \"f-string\", as a shorthand for \"format string\". This is to avoid confusion with the other meaning of format string (the string that is passed into the `format!` / `print!` macros), but up for changing it to just format string, to be easier to understand for users.\r\n- This implementation doesn't have any addition of options, as I think it may conflict with type ascription: e.g. `f\"{foo:x}\"` could be trying to print `foo` with the hex option, or it could be ascribing type `x` to the `foo` expression.\r\n  - As type ascription is unstable, this isn't a huge problem.\r\n  - This could be solved by just automatically assuming this is a format option until otherwise proven - and `f\"{foo:type:}\"` could be used if people really want type ascription. This may be more tricky to implement though, so I'm leaving that until I get some feedback on this.\r\n- A `Lexer` struct has been made, to replace `Cursor`, as it now needs to be stateful to keep track of the f-string nesting.\r\n- There was a bit of back-and-forth on deciding if f-strings should be treated as \"proper\" literals or not. Currently this is the solution:\r\n  - `rustc_lexer::TokenKind` and `rustc_ast::TokenKind` have `FStr` directly on them, as opposed to in `LiteralKind`. See `rustc_lexer/tests.rs` for the new f-string tests.\r\n  - `rustc_ast::ExprKind` has a new `FStr` member too, but it is fully parsed at this point.\r\n  - This then plugs directly into the existing `format_args!` machinery, with one change - `alloc::fmt::format` is now a lang intrinsic. To allow f-strings on non-std platforms in future, we could add an extra prefix to allow for getting `FormatArgs` directly from f-strings (e.g. `fa\"foo {1 + 1}\"` and/or `af\"bar {2 + 2}\"` would return `FormatArgs`)\r\n- `rustc_expand::proc_macro_server` has been modified to add f-strings - would this be a breaking change? If so, how could it be changed in a backwards-compatible way? Editions?\r\n- Should expressions f-strings support statements? i.e. should the parser treat the inner expression as a block? It is surrounded by braces, so it would fit. Would be quite cool (or hacky, depending on your opinion): `f\"{ let a = 2; a }\" -> \"2\"`\r\n- Currently f-strings don't have suffixes, whereas other strings do. I think this is ok?\r\n- There are various `// TODO`s around the diff, feedback appreciated :)", "created_at": "2023-03-27T02:18:57Z", "updated_at": "2023-03-27T21:13:01Z", "closed_at":
