I am splitting it out because:\r\n * It generates many bad merge conflicts so I want to get it merged\r\n * There is a bikeshed issue blocking it which needs to be resolved one way or the other\r\n\r\nThis MR has <strike>three</strike> two kinds of change:\r\n 1. Alphabetically sort various tables of `ErrorKind`s\r\n 2. `use ErrorKind::*` and remove a lot of individual `ErrorKind::` qualifiers.\r\n\r\nThere was also a bikeshed issue which was impeding the progress of #79965.  <strike>I would like to resolve it one way or the other.  I request that @T-libs either (a) decide to merge this MR, accepting my bikeshed colour, or (b) formally close this MR to indicate a positive decision to colour the bikeshed the other way.  In case (b) I will resubmit it with the bikeshed repainted.</strike>\r\n\r\nAs discussed below, the bikeshed is now painted the colour which seems most popular.  I think the contents of this MR are now uncontroversial.\r\n\r\n<strike>\r\n### Bikeshed discussion\r\n\r\nAs might be expected with a style discussion, I have strong feelings :-).  While I recognise that that's (as ever) rather disproportionate to the issue at hand, I want to put forward my arguments in favour of my preferred colour.\r\n\r\nI think the best argument is to tell a story about how item (2) - the defensive typesafety - came to be in this MR.  #79965 has been through a lot of discussion and modification.  Originally, it did not have the tabular reformatting.  I considered it but felt it would be controversial (and I was right...)\r\n\r\nHowever, the discussion in #79965 produced many changes.  New error kinds, suggestions to merge or split them, etc.   I kept having to rework the mappng tables.  I found the non-tabular format meant I couldn't see the trees for the wood.  It was too hard to work with.\r\n\r\nSo I decided to pay the price of the controversy, and to propose to reformat these tables.  I naturally used semiautomatic means to do the actual reformatting.\r\n\r\nAfter I had reformatted the Windows mapping table I found that it looked like this:\r\n```\r\n+        c::ERROR_TOO_MANY_LINKS                         => return TooManyLinks,\r\n+        c::ERROR_FILENAME_EXCED_RANGE                   => FilenameTooLong,\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a bug.  This bug was rendered almost invisibile by the previous formatting: everything being higgledy-piggeldy had obscured the underlying regularity of the code.  That made it easy for me to add an irregular, and incorrect, entry.\r\n\r\n<strike>Since I love using Rust's type system to defend against my mistakes, I also added the defensive programming commit (item 2 in my bullet list).  But if I had not reformatted this, I wouldn't have spotted this and quite possibly neither would anyone else.</strike>\r\n\r\nAs @dtolnay points out, this bug would be caught by the type system when the code is compiled for Windows in the CI, even though it was not detected in my local build for Unix.  However, the difference in the visibility of the mistake is still very striking and IMO demonstrates that the non-tabular layout is seriously inferior.\r\n\r\n#### Countrerarguments\r\n\r\n * *Tabular formats involve noisy and disruptive shuffling when the maximum size of entries changes.*  This is true if the table is made dense, with every column just wide enough for its contents (and if one insists on not having any deviations from the tabular layout).  However, in my proposal I have made the columns deliberately very wide so that they will fit foreseeable new entries.  Such a reformatting cannot be ruled out of course, but it seems to me that it will happen very rarely.\r\n * *This is contrary to Rust community style norms*.  I don't think it is.  There are existing places in `rust-lang/rust` where tables are rendered as-such.  Also, multiple people have requested that rustfmt gain a feature to more usefully manage the formatting of tabular code.\r\n * *Disabling rustfmt will make it harder to maintain these functions*.  There is almost no code in these functions other than the mapping tables.  It is true that adding a new `ErrorKind` will now involve manually inserting the right number of spaces.  I think this is a price well worth paying for being able to see what we're doing.\r\n</strike>", "created_at": "2021-05-06T11:38:58Z", "updated_at": "2021-07-03T06:53:47Z", "closed_at":
