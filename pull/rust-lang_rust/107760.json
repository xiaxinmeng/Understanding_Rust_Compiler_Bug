Of these, PG's impl is the most similar to this one, at least at a high level[^pg].\r\n\r\n[^pg]: The main similarity is that PG also uses 32bit rows in the transition table, and has a special case for ASCII (even if the way we special case it is very different). Beyond that, the impls are really totally different (theirs has fewer optimizations, doesn't need tracking any info for error positions, uses a different UTF8 automaton, and is just completely different code).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is not quite ready for review. I'm mostly getting this up now so I can check some perf runs and such. Assuming they (or further benchmarks) don't reveal issues, I believe the approach is basically complete, but the PR needs the following work to be ready for review I intend to:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add more comments/docs, it's totally impossible to follow at the moment.\r\n- [ ] Rewrite the code for the table so that it's comprehensible\u00a0instead of a total black box, and include a link to a generator the constants use.\r\n- [ ] Rewrite the ASCII scan loop (which is pretty clownshoes at the moment, and probably should still handle alignment after the first load).\r\n- [ ] Ensure the tests cover all the optimized cases (both short/long strings).\r\n- [ ] Integrate some of my benchmarks[^bench].\r\n\r\n[^bench]: The benchmarks I have locally have too much PII to be published as-is, since I derived them from real use including browser history (among other things), but that's a temporary situation. Some preliminary benchmarks based on the `simdutf8` corpus are [here](https://gist.github.com/thomcc/1d03d323aecfed570c77c060e2e1cb63). It demonstrates a speedup in basically every case (across all string sizes and character compositions), although the real-world improvement seems to be even higher (the impl this replaces has branch misprediction issues for non-ASCII, which are not reflected in these benchmarks). \r\n\r\nI'm deliberately leaving anything that touches other functions as follow-up work that I'll do after this lands. That includes improving `String::from_utf8_lossy` or sharing any logic with `is_ascii`\r\n\r\n(Note: some stuff came up in $dayjob so it may be a week or two before I finish all this, just wanted to get this up in the meantime so that it's not really in the back of my mind as much)\r\n\r\n## Appendix: FAQ\r\n\r\n### Potential Drawbacks\r\n\r\n- Weird algo involving a magic table. I will document this way better so that this drawback goes away.\r\n- Slightly slower in the invalid UTF-8 path, as we may re-validate up to 16 bytes. I'll probably fix this for truncation, but even so it is pretty minimal. It's very likely that if the error isn't right at the start of the string, this is version is still much faster.\r\n- Probably worse on some machines, including ones slow (slower than doing scalar operations) unaligned loads, and slow dynamic right shifts (slower than branching).\r\n- Additional 1kb table, although I'm very careful not to touch it for the pure-ASCII path (doing this without eliminating the benefit of the shift-DFA was hard).\r\n- Need `const_eval_select`. This is both because LLVM was doing worse on the `while ...` version of some of the loops, and because `core::simd` isn't const-compatible (trait usage). The function we call would still exist either way though.\r\n\r\n### Why not `simdutf8`'s algorithm?\r\n\r\nShort version:\r\n- Can't use algos requiring new instructions in libcore for various reasons. Not worth it to maintain just for `-Zbuild-std` users (okay, and `aarch64` users).\r\n- This impl is\u00a0pretty small, mostly portable (a couple special cases in the ASCII handling, but nothing complex or conditionally compiled), and does not require much target-specific complexity.\r\n- On the bright side, we're faster for strings up to around 40-120 bytes anyway. At least on my machines.\r\n\r\nLong version: <https://gist.github.com/thomcc/f153a122f680023f937f2c912978b8e6>.\r\n", "created_at": "2023-02-07T13:47:43Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-09T13:36:22Z",
