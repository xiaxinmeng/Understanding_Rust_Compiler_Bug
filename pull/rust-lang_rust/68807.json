Again, arithmetic and overflow handling with multiple integer types of different widths and signedness is tricky, careful review would be appreciated. I had to change a few of of Simon's originally added tests to get them to pass, but I believe that their formulation is correct now and they were incorrect before.\r\n\r\nThis could use a perf test to see how it impacts performance. Hopefully, due to the fact that this version of the redesign really is pretty much just removing `replace_one`/`replace_zero` and renaming the other functions to fit the description as successor/predecessor rather than add/sub, it shouldn't impact much. This also makes a potential impl to make `RangeInclusive<char>` work much more practical.", "created_at": "2020-02-03T21:24:51Z", "updated_at": "2020-02-16T03:52:19Z", "closed_at":
