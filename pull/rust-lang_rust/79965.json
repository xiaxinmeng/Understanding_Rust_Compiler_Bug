Taking some Unix examples, `ENOTEMPTY` and\r\n`EXDEV` have obvious recovery strategies.  Recently I was surprised to\r\ndiscover that `ENOSPC` came out as `ErrorKind::Other`.\r\n\r\nSince I am familiar with Unix I reviwed the list of errno values in\r\n  https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/errno.h.html\r\n\r\nHere, I add those that most clearly seem to be needed.\r\n\r\n@CraftSpider provided information about Windows, and references, which\r\nI have tried to take into account.\r\n\r\nThis has to be insta-stable because we can't sensibly have a different\r\nset of ErrorKinds depending on a std feature flag.\r\n\r\nI have *not* added these to the mapping tables for any operating\r\nsystems other than Unix and Windows.  I hope that it is OK to add them\r\nnow for Unix and Windows now, and maybe add them to other OS's mapping\r\ntables as and when someone on that OS is able to consider the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nI adopted the general principle that it was usually a bad idea to map\r\ntwo distinct error values to the same Rust error code.  I notice that\r\nthis principle is already violated in the case of `EACCES` and\r\n`EPERM`, which both map to `PermissionDenied`.  I think this was\r\nprobably a mistake but it would be quite hard to change now, so I\r\ndon't propose to do anything about that.\r\n\r\nHowever, for Windows, there are sometimes different error codes for\r\nidentical situations.  Eg there are WSA* versions of some error\r\ncodes as well as ERROR_* ones.  Also Windows seems to have a great\r\nmany more erorr codes.  I don't know precisely what best practice\r\nwould be for Windows.\r\n```\r\n\r\n<strike>\r\n\r\n```\r\nErrno values I wasn't sure about so *haven't* included:\r\n\r\nEMFILE ENFILE ENOBUFS ENOLCK:\r\n\r\n  These are all fairly Unix-specific resource exhaustion situations.\r\n  In practice it seemed not very likely to me that anyone would want\r\n  to handle these differently to `Other`.\r\n\r\nENOMEM ERANGE EDOM EOVERFLOW\r\n\r\n  Normally these don't get exposed to the Rust callers I hope.  They\r\n  don't tend to come out of filesystem APIs.\r\n\r\nEILSEQ\r\n\r\n  Hopefully Rust libraries open files in binary mode and do the\r\n  converstion in Rust.  So Rust code ought not to be exposed to\r\n  EILSEQ.\r\n\r\nEIO\r\n\r\n  The range of things that could cause this is troublesome.  I found\r\n  it difficult to describe.  I do think it would be useful to add this\r\n  at some point, because EIO on a filesystem operation is much more\r\n  serious than most other errors.\r\n\r\nENETDOWN\r\n\r\n  I wasn't sure if this was useful or, indeed, if any modern systems\r\n  use it.\r\n\r\nENOEXEC\r\n\r\n  It is not clear to me how a Rust program could respond to this.  It\r\n  seems rather niche.\r\n\r\nEPROTO ENETRESET ENODATA ENOMSG ENOPROTOOPT ENOSR ENOSTR ETIME\r\nENOTRECOVERABLE EOWNERDEAD EBADMSG EPROTONOSUPPORT EPROTOTYPE EIDRM\r\n\r\n  These are network or STREAMS related errors which I have never in\r\n  my own Unix programming found the need to do anything with.  I think\r\n  someone who understands these better should be the one to try to\r\n  find good Rust names and descriptions for them.\r\n\r\nENOTTY ENXIO ENODEV EOPNOTSUPP ESRCH EALREADY ECANCELED ECHILD\r\nEINPROGRESS\r\n\r\n  These are very hard to get unless you're already doing something\r\n  very Unix-specific, in which case the raw_os_error interface is\r\n  probably more suitable than relying on the Rust ErrorKind mapping.\r\n\r\nEFAULT EBADF\r\n\r\n  These would seem to be the result of application UB.\r\n```\r\n</strike>\r\n<i>(omitted errnos are discussed below, especially in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79965#issuecomment-810468334)", "created_at": "2020-12-12T15:19:13Z", "updated_at": "2022-12-30T02:13:29Z", "closed_at": "2021-07-03T06:53:45Z", "merged_at": "2021-07-03T06:53:45Z", "merge_commit_sha": "fdd9a071474d898556891d5146fd9e8d1a10a077", "assignee": {"login": "m-ou-se", "id": 783247, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc4MzI0Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/783247?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se", "html_url": "https://github.com/m-ou-se", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "m-ou-se", "id": 783247, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc4MzI0Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/783247?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se", "html_url": "https://github.com/m-ou-se", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 211668062, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgwNjI=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-libs-api", "name": "T-libs-api", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the library API team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 223796632, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMjM3OTY2MzI=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/relnotes", "name": "relnotes", "color": "fad8c7", "default": false, "description": "Marks issues that should be documented in the release notes of the next release."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
