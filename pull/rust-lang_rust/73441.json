The standard library's support for `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` requires\r\nin-process parsing of object files and DWARF debug information to\r\ninterpret it and print the filename/line number of stack frames as part\r\nof a backtrace.\r\n\r\nHistorically this support in the standard library has come from a\r\nlibrary called \"libbacktrace\". The libbacktrace library seems to have\r\nbeen extracted from gcc at some point and is written in C. We've had a\r\nlot of issues with libbacktrace over time, unfortunately, though. The\r\nlibrary does not appear to be actively maintained since we've had\r\npatches sit for months-to-years without comments. We have discovered a\r\ngood number of soundness issues with the library itself, both when\r\nparsing valid DWARF as well as invalid DWARF. This is enough of an issue\r\nthat the libs team has previously decided that we cannot feed untrusted\r\ninputs to libbacktrace. This also doesn't take into account the\r\nportability of libbacktrace which has been difficult to manage and\r\nmaintain over time. While possible there are lots of exceptions and it's\r\nthe main C dependency of the standard library right now.\r\n\r\nFor years it's been the desire to switch over to a Rust-based solution\r\nfor symbolicating backtraces. It's been assumed that we'll be using the\r\nGimli family of crates for this purpose, which are targeted at safely\r\nand efficiently parsing DWARF debug information. I've been working\r\nrecently to shore up the Gimli support in the `backtrace` crate. As of a\r\nfew weeks ago the `backtrace` crate, by default, uses Gimli when loaded\r\nfrom crates.io. This transition has gone well enough that I figured it\r\nwas time to start talking seriously about this change to the standard\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nThis commit is a preview of what's probably the best way to integrate\r\nthe `backtrace` crate into the standard library with the Gimli feature\r\nturned on. While today it's used as a crates.io dependency, this commit\r\nswitches the `backtrace` crate to a submodule of this repository which\r\nwill need to be updated manually. This is not done lightly, but is\r\nthought to be the best solution. The primary reason for this is that the\r\n`backtrace` crate needs to do some pretty nontrivial filesystem\r\ninteractions to locate debug information. Working without `std::fs` is\r\nnot an option, and while it might be possible to do some sort of\r\ntrait-based solution when prototyped it was found to be too unergonomic.\r\nUsing a submodule allows the `backtrace` crate to build as a submodule\r\nof the `std` crate itself, enabling it to use `std::fs` and such.\r\n\r\nOtherwise this adds new dependencies to the standard library. This step\r\nrequires extra attention because this means that these crates are now\r\ngoing to be included with all Rust programs by default. It's important\r\nto note, however, that we're already shipping libbacktrace with all Rust\r\nprograms by default and it has a bunch of C code implementing all of\r\nthis internally anyway, so we're basically already switching\r\nalready-shipping functionality to Rust from C.\r\n\r\n* `object` - this crate is used to parse object file headers and\r\n  contents. Very low-level support is used from this crate and almost\r\n  all of it is disabled. Largely we're just using struct definitions as\r\n  well as convenience methods internally to read bytes and such.\r\n\r\n* `addr2line` - this is the main meat of the implementation for\r\n  symbolication. This crate depends on `gimli` for DWARF parsing and\r\n  then provides interfaces needed by the `backtrace` crate to turn an\r\n  address into a filename / line number. This crate is actually pretty\r\n  small (fits in a single file almost!) and mirrors most of what\r\n  `dwarf.c` does for libbacktrace.\r\n\r\n* `miniz_oxide` - the libbacktrace crate transparently handles\r\n  compressed debug information which is compressed with zlib. This crate\r\n  is used to decompress compressed debug sections.\r\n\r\n* `gimli` - not actually used directly, but a dependency of `addr2line`.\r\n\r\n* `adler32`- not used directly either, but a dependency of\r\n  `miniz_oxide`.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this change is to improve the safety of backtrace\r\nsymbolication in the standard library, especially in the face of\r\npossibly malformed DWARF debug information. Even to this day we're still\r\nseeing segfaults in libbacktrace which could possibly become security\r\nvulnerabilities. This change should almost entirely eliminate this\r\npossibility whilc also paving the way forward to adding more features\r\nlike split debug information.\r\n\r\nSome references for those interested are:\r\n\r\n* Original addition of libbacktrace - #12602\r\n* OOM with libbacktrace - #24231\r\n* Backtrace failure due to use of uninitialized value - #28447\r\n* Possibility to feed untrusted data to libbacktrace - #21889\r\n* Soundness fix for libbacktrace - #33729\r\n* Crash in libbacktrace - #39468\r\n* Support for macOS, never merged - ianlancetaylor/libbacktrace#2\r\n* Performance issues with libbacktrace - #29293, #37477\r\n* Update procedure is quite complicated due to how many patches we\r\n  need to carry - #50955\r\n* Libbacktrace doesn't work on MinGW with dynamic libs - #71060\r\n* Segfault in libbacktrace on macOS - #71397\r\n\r\nSwitching to Rust will not make us immune to all of these issues. The\r\ncrashes are expected to go away, but correctness and performance may\r\nstill have bugs arise. The gimli and `backtrace` crates, however, are\r\nactively maintained unlike libbacktrace, so this should enable us to at\r\nleast efficiently apply fixes as situations come up.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI want to note that my purpose for creating a PR here is to start a conversation about this. I think that all the various pieces are in place that this is compelling enough that I think this transition should be talked about seriously. There are a number of items which still need to be addressed before actually merging this PR, however:\r\n\r\n* [ ] `gimli` needs to be published to crates.io\r\n* [ ] `addr2line` needs a publish\r\n* [ ] `miniz_oxide` needs a publish\r\n* [ ] Tests probably shouldn't recommend the `gimli` crate's traits for implementing\r\n* [ ] The `backtrace` crate's branch changes need to be merged to the master branch (https://github.com/rust-lang/backtrace-rs/pull/349)\r\n* [ ] The support for `libbacktrace` on some platforms needs to be audited to see if we should support more strategies in the gimli implementation - https://github.com/rust-lang/backtrace-rs/issues/325, https://github.com/rust-lang/backtrace-rs/issues/326, https://github.com/rust-lang/backtrace-rs/issues/350, https://github.com/rust-lang/backtrace-rs/issues/351\r\n\r\nMost of the merging/publishing I'm not actively pushing on right now. It's a bit wonky for crates to support libstd so I'm holding off on pulling the trigger everywhere until there's a bit more discussion about how to go through with this. Namely https://github.com/rust-lang/backtrace-rs/pull/349 I'm going to hold off merging until we decide to go through with the submodule strategy.\r\n\r\nIn any case this is a pretty major change, so I suspect that the compiler team is likely going to be interested in this. I don't mean to force changes by dumping a bunch of code by any means. Integration of external crates into the standard library is so difficult I wanted to have a proof-of-concept to review while talking about whether to do this at all (hence the PR), but I'm more than happy to follow any processes needed to merge this. I must admit though that I'm not entirely sure myself at this time what the process would be to decide to merge this, so I'm hoping others can help me figure that out!", "created_at": "2020-06-17T14:48:17Z", "updated_at": "2020-07-23T00:42:39Z", "closed_at": "2020-07-18T19:29:39Z", "merged_at": "2020-07-18T19:29:39Z", "merge_commit_sha": "1fa54ad9680cc82e7301f8ed4e9b7402dfd6ce0e", "assignee": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
