This could be avoided if it were possible to convert an `&Arc`/`&Rc` to a `&Weak` directly, with a function like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl<T: ?Sized> Arc<T> {\r\n    pub const fn as_weak<'a>(this: &'a Self) -> &'a Weak<T> {\r\n        unsafe { mem::transmute::<&'a Arc<T>, &'a Weak<T>>(this) }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn memory, `Arc`/`Rc` and `sync::Weak`/`rc::Weak` are both represented by a `NotNull` pointer to the backing `ArcInner`/`RcBox` where the reference counts and inner value are actually stored. Whether a reference is strong or weak exists only at the type level, and the static guarantees provided by `Weak` (that the pointed-to allocation will exist, unless the pointer has the special non-aligned `Weak::new` value) are strictly weaker than those provided by `Arc`/`Rc` (that the pointed-to allocation will exist full-stop, and that the value inside that allocation will still be valid/will not have been dropped yet). The `Arc`/`Rc` do have a `PhantomData<T>` that the `Weak`s do not, but it's zero-size and shouldn't affect layout, only drop behaviour (which isn't relevant since the proposed function is for borrowed values).\r\n\r\nThis requires the addition of the `#[repr(transparent)]` attribute to `Arc`/`Rc`, and `Weak` in order to guarantee their memory layouts are identical. (`#[repr(C)]` might also work for that purpose, but I'm not sure if that would break the `NonZero` niche optimization.) According to the discussions at https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72841#pullrequestreview-429527831, adding the `#[repr]` does **not** constitute a public interface change/commitment because the internal fields are still private (and with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90435 such `#[repr]`s may be hidden from the docs in the future). So even if the `#[repr(transparent)]` were added, this function still couldn't be implemented in an external crate as the crate wouldn't be able to soundly rely on the layout remaining the same; this function can only be implemented in the standard library.\r\n\r\nThis implementation is gated behind a new `#![feature(rc_as_weak)]`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_previous discussion: [Rust Internals thread
