For example, in some embedded and/or unconventional platforms, it tends to be helpful for linkage trickery even if it is unstable. \r\n\r\nMinimal example:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    unsafe {\r\n        dbg!(test1().unwrap());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nextern {\r\n    #[link_name = \"test\"]\r\n    fn test1() -> Result<u32, u32>;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[no_mangle]\r\nfn test() -> Result<u32, u32> {\r\n    Ok(3)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this situation, it may be unclear to some users that not specifying an ABI for the `extern` block and not specifying an ABI for the exposed `#[no_mangle]` function will actually lead to a mismatch of ABI due to the fact the default ABIs for these two contexts are different.\r\n\r\nThe resulting warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwarning: `extern` block uses type `std::result::Result<u32, u32>`, which is not FFI-safe\r\n --> src/main.rs:9:19\r\n  |\r\n9 |     fn test1() -> Result<u32, u32>;\r\n  |                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ not FFI-safe\r\n  |\r\n  = note: `#[warn(improper_ctypes)]` on by default\r\n  = help: consider adding a `#[repr(C)]`, `#[repr(transparent)]`, or integer `#[repr(...)]` attribute to this enum\r\n  = note: enum has no representation hint\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error doesn't at all allude to the actual problem causing their issue, and has (multiple times, in my experience) lead to a rather dead-in debugging experience. (Maybe it should explicitly say `extern` defaults to `extern \"C\"`?)\r\n\r\nWhile I believe this style of:\r\n\r\n1. Not specifying an ABI\r\n2. Abusing `#[no_mangle]`\r\n\r\nis not good practice, it *is* something I have seen happen multiple times (from myself and from others asking questions) and while `extern \"Rust\"` is not *recommended*, giving the user things (to google, for example) which will lead to the discovery of information about the instability of the Rust ABI and the nature, it will direct users towards the information they need to solve their problem.\r\n\r\nWhile I would argue `#[no_mangle]` without `extern` should raise a warning or error (as this would lead to exposing a Rust ABI function being opt-in, which better matches the unstable nature of the Rust ABI), I believe that is a significantly more controversial way to go about improving the user experience around this, hence this PR only being an update to existing warning, however I'm totally open to others' ideas on the subject.", "created_at": "2020-08-01T22:16:20Z", "updated_at": "2020-09-07T19:21:30Z", "closed_at": "2020-09-07T19:21:30Z",
