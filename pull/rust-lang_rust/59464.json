The\r\n`wasm32-unknown-wasi` target is intended to be a WebAssembly target\r\nwhich matches the [WASI proposal recently announced][LINK]. In summary\r\nthe WASI target is an effort to define a standard set of syscalls for\r\nWebAssembly modules, allowing WebAssembly modules to not only be\r\nportable across architectures but also be portable across environments\r\nimplementing this standard set of system calls.\r\n\r\nThe wasi target in libstd is still somewhat bare bones. This PR does not\r\nfill out the filesystem, networking, threads, etc. Instead it only\r\nprovides the most basic of integration with the wasi syscalls, enabling\r\nfeatures like:\r\n\r\n* `Instant::now` and `SystemTime::now` work\r\n* `env::args` is hooked up\r\n* `env::vars` will look up environment variables\r\n* `println!` will print to standard out\r\n* `process::{exit, abort}` should be hooked up appropriately\r\n\r\nNone of these APIs can work natively on the `wasm32-unknown-unknown`\r\ntarget, but with the assumption of the WASI set of syscalls we're able\r\nto provide implementations of these syscalls that engines can implement.\r\nCurrently the primary engine implementing wasi is [wasmtime], but more\r\nwill surely emerge!\r\n\r\nIn terms of future development of libstd, I think this is something\r\nwe'll probably want to discuss. The purpose of the WASI target is to\r\nprovide a standardized set of syscalls, but it's *also* to provide a\r\nstandard C sysroot for compiling C/C++ programs. This means it's\r\nintended that functions like `read` and `write` are implemented for this\r\ntarget with a relatively standard definition and implementation. It's\r\nunclear, therefore, how we want to expose file descriptors and how we'll\r\nwant to implement system primitives. For example should `std::fs::File`\r\nhave a libc-based file descriptor underneath it? The raw wasi file\r\ndescriptor? We'll see! Currently these details are all intentionally\r\nhidden and things we can change over time.\r\n\r\nA `WasiFd` sample struct was added to the standard library as part of\r\nthis commit, but it's not currently used. It shows how all the wasi\r\nsyscalls could be ergonomically bound in Rust, and they offer a possible\r\nimplementation of primitives like `std::fs::File` if we bind wasi file\r\ndescriptors exactly.\r\n\r\nApart from the standard library, there's also the matter of how this\r\ntarget is integrated with respect to its C standard library. The\r\nreference sysroot, for example, provides managment of standard unix file\r\ndescriptors and also standard APIs like `open` (as opposed to the\r\nrelative `openat` inspiration for the wasi ssycalls). Currently the\r\nstandard library relies on the C sysroot symbols for operations such as\r\nenvironment management, process exit, and `read`/`write` of stdio fds.\r\nWe want these operations in Rust to be interoperable with C if they're\r\nused in the same process. Put another way, if Rust and C are linked into\r\nthe same WebAssembly binary they should work together, but that requires\r\nthat the same C standard library is used.\r\n\r\nWe also, however, want the `wasm32-unknown-wasi` target to be\r\nusable-by-default with the Rust compiler without requiring a separate\r\ntoolchain to get downloaded and configured. With that in mind, there's\r\ntwo modes of operation for the `wasm32-unknown-wasi` target:\r\n\r\n1. By default the C standard library is statically provided inside of\r\n   `liblibc.rlib` distributed as part of the sysroot. This means that\r\n   you can `rustc foo.wasm --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` and you're\r\n   good to go, a fully workable wasi binary pops out. This is\r\n   incompatible with linking in C code, however, which may be compiled\r\n   against a different sysroot than the Rust code was previously\r\n   compiled against. In this mode the default of `rust-lld` is used to\r\n   link binaries.\r\n\r\n2. For linking with C code, the `-C target-feature=-crt-static` flag\r\n   needs to be passed. This takes inspiration from the musl target for\r\n   this flag, but the idea is that you're no longer using the provided\r\n   static C runtime, but rather one will be provided externally. This\r\n   flag is intended to also get coupled with an external `clang`\r\n   compiler configured with its own sysroot. Therefore you'll typically\r\n   use this flag with `-C linker=/path/to/clang-script-wrapper`. Using\r\n   this mode the Rust code will continue to reference standard C\r\n   symbols, but the definition will be pulled in by the linker configured.\r\n\r\nAlright so that's all the current state of this PR. I suspect we'll\r\ndefinitely want to discuss this before landing of course! This PR is\r\ncoupled with libc changes as well which I'll be posting shortly.\r\n\r\n[LINK]: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/\r\n[wasmtime]: https://github.com/cranestation/wasmtime-wasi", "created_at": "2019-03-27T16:23:34Z", "updated_at": "2019-05-01T17:49:23Z", "closed_at": "2019-03-30T06:06:16Z", "merged_at": "2019-03-30T06:06:16Z", "merge_commit_sha": "ace71240d233e71fcc6e3824fa2e5e05697fd2cc", "assignee": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
