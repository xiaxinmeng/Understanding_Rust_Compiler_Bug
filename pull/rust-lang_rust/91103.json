This was not super noticeable because clicking a link inside the method heading would navigate to that link. But clicking any unlinked black text in a method heading would trigger the behavior.\r\n\r\nThat behavior was somewhat unexpected, and means that if you try to click a type name in a method heading, but miss by a few pixels, you get a confusing surprise.\r\n\r\nThis change inhibits that behavior by putting an event listener on most summaries that cancels the event unless the event target was the summary itself. In practice, that means it cancels the event unless the target was the \"[+]\" / \"[-]\", because the rest of the heading is wrapped inside a `<div>`, which is the target for anything that doesn't have a more specific target.\r\n\r\nr? @Manishearth ", "created_at": "2021-11-21T08:48:39Z", "updated_at": "2021-11-23T23:49:06Z", "closed_at": "2021-11-23T23:49:02Z", "merged_at": "2021-11-23T23:49:02Z", "merge_commit_sha": "eb5c2d38952d9e281a28a4c6cb417b4cce83fe71", "assignee": {"login": "Manishearth", "id": 1617736, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc3MzY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1617736?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth", "html_url": "https://github.com/Manishearth", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "Manishearth", "id": 1617736, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc3MzY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1617736?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth", "html_url": "https://github.com/Manishearth", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 203738, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM3Mzg=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-rustdoc", "name": "T-rustdoc", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the rustdoc team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
