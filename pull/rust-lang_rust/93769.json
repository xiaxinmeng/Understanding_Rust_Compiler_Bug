That makes a huge difference compared to `into_iter`.\r\n- Apparently people do use `mem::forget` a lot and are surprised by its effect, see the history of the notice on `vec::drain`.\r\n\r\nReasons not to do that:\r\n- It makes the description overwhelming. To mitigate that, I moved these paragraphs into a separate section.\r\n- It may lock in a contract that a later implementation may wish to violate. Though as far as I see that's only the case for `string::drain`.\r\n\r\nI'd rather move the Leaking section below Panics because it seems much more of a detail, just didn't do that to reduce changes where the clause exists already.\r\n\r\nr? @yaahc", "created_at": "2022-02-08T10:56:03Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-09T15:10:50Z", "closed_at": "2022-02-09T14:11:23Z", "merged_at": null,
