Of course I might be totally wrong. Any comments are greatly appreciated. )\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently `std::net` does not support socket configurations before binding to an address. For example, set `SO_REUSEADDR` is common for UDP sockets and it is not possible using `std::net`. \r\n\r\n## Proposal \r\n\r\nAdd `UnboundUdpSocket` in `std::net` to support UDP socket configurations before binding to an address. Once bound, the socket will become a regular `UdpSocket`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly `UnboundTcpSocket` is to support TCP socket configurations before connecting or binding.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nThe implementation is straightforward and kept to minimum at this moment. \r\n\r\nNote1: for `UnboundUdpSocket`, only configurations of `SO_REUSEADDR` is implemented in its public API. It is because what I needed, also because adding more methods is not the key point of this patch.\r\n\r\nNote2: for `UnboundTcpSocket`,  because the current codebase [already sets `SO_REUSEADDR` for `TcpListener`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/20ad8209288896259cd1829d2b057bc017315fce/library/std/src/sys_common/net.rs#L395), this diff only prepares for `UnboundTcpSocket` by implementing its `net_imp` part. I did not have a specific need to add for TCP at this moment, hence did not implement its public API.\r\n\r\nNote3: `UnboundUdpSocket` is also useful for Windows platforms by supporting `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE`.\r\n\r\n~~Also, the issue number `99999` is a placeholder.~~\r\n\r\n## Prior art\r\n\r\nThe most popular crate for socket programming is probably [`socket2`](https://crates.io/crates/socket2).  However, I believe `std::net` is worth to be enhanced to support socket operations before binding.  \r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for all comments in the Rust internals discussion I linked at the top.  They are very helpful and encouraging.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\n- I also added a new `SocketAddrFamily` so that we can create a `Socket` without a full `SocketAddr`. \r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n- Issue number changed to `none` as the number 99999 was [taken](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/99999) recently. \r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n- An ACP was submitted: https://github.com/rust-lang/libs-team/issues/66 \r\n",
