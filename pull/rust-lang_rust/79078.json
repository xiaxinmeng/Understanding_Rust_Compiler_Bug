Crater found one such regression, where import `use foo as derive` goes into a cycle with `#[derive(Something)]`.\r\n- **[feature-gated]** `#[derive]` is now expanded as any other attributes in left-to-right order. This allows to remove the restriction on other macro attributes following `#[derive]` (https://github.com/rust-lang/reference/issues/566). The following macro attributes become a part of the derive's input (this is not a change, non-macro attributes following `#[derive]` were treated in the same way previously).\r\n- `#[derive]` is now expanded as any other attributes in left-to-right order. This means two derive attributes `#[derive(Foo)] #[derive(Bar)]` are now expanded separately rather than together. It doesn't generally make difference, except for esoteric cases. For example `#[derive(Foo)]` can now produce an import bringing `Bar` into scope, but previously both `Foo` and `Bar` were required to be resolved before expanding any of them.\r\n- **[feature-gated]** `#[derive()]` (with empty list in parentheses) actually becomes useful. For historical reasons `#[derive]` *fully configures* its input, eagerly evaluating `cfg` everywhere in its target, for example on fields.\r\nExpansion infra doesn't do that for other attributes, but now when macro attributes attributes are allowed to be written after `#[derive]`, it means that derive can *fully configure* items for them.\r\n    ```rust\r\n\t#[derive()]\r\n\t#[my_attr]\r\n\tstruct S {\r\n\t\t#[cfg(FALSE)] // this field in removed by `#[derive()]` and not observed by `#[my_attr]`\r\n\t\tfield: u8\r\n\t}\r\n    ```\r\n- `#[derive]` on some non-item targets is now prohibited. This was accidentally allowed as noop in the past, but was warned about since early 2018 (#50092), despite that crater found a few such cases in unmaintained crates.\r\n- Derive helper attributes used before their introduction are now reported with a deprecation lint. This change is long overdue (since macro modularization, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/52226#issuecomment-422605033), but it was hard to do without fixing expansion order for derives. The deprecation is tracked by #79202.\r\n```rust\r\n    #[trait_helper] // warning: derive helper attribute is used before it is introduced\r\n    #[derive(Trait)]\r\n    struct S {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCrater analysis: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79078#issuecomment-731436821", "created_at": "2020-11-15T19:33:14Z", "updated_at": "2021-02-22T23:12:54Z", "closed_at": "2021-02-07T22:25:15Z", "merged_at": "2021-02-07T22:25:15Z", "merge_commit_sha": "9778068cbc1e06cc3685422323ff38a2f397de26", "assignee": {"login": "Aaron1011", "id": 1408859, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDg4NTk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1408859?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011", "html_url": "https://github.com/Aaron1011", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "Aaron1011", "id": 1408859, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDg4NTk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1408859?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011", "html_url": "https://github.com/Aaron1011", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aaron1011/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 234948, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzQ5NDg=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/A-attributes", "name": "A-attributes", "color": "f7e101", "default": false, "description": "Area: #[attributes(..)]"}, {"id": 132910982, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MTA5ODI=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/A-macros", "name": "A-macros", "color": "f7e101", "default": false, "description": "Area: All kinds of macros (custom derive, macro_rules!, proc macros, ..)"}, {"id": 211668019, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgwMTk=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-lang", "name": "T-lang", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the language team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
