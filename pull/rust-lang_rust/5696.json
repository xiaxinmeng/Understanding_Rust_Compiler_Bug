It might as well be called `HashMap` instead of being named after the specific implementation, since there's only one.\n\nSipHash distributes keys so well that I don't think there will ever be much need to use anything but a simple hash table with open addressing. If there _is_ a better way to do it, it will probably be better in all cases and can just be the default implementation. \n\nA cuckoo-hashing implementation combining a weaker hash with SipHash could be useful, but that won't be as general purpose - you would need to write a separate fast hash function specialized for the type to really take advantage of it (like taking a page from libstdc++/libc++ and just using the integer value as the \"hash\"). I think a more specific naming for a truly alternative implementation like that would be fine, with the nice naming reserved for the general purpose container.\n", "created_at":
