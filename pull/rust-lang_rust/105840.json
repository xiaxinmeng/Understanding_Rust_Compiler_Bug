A significant contributor to the size of the implementation is that it has two comparisons. And this actually follows through to the final x86_64 codegen too, which is... strange. We don't need two `cmp` instructions in order to do a single Rust-level comparison. So I started tweaking the implementation, and came up with the same thing as https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64082 (which I didn't know about at the time), I ran `llvm-mca` on it per the issue which was linked in the code to establish that it looked better, and submitted it for a benchmark run.\r\n\r\nThe initial benchmark run regresses basically everything. By looking through the cachegrind diffs in the perf report then the `perf annotate` for regressed functions, I was able to identify one source of the regression: `Ord::min` and `Ord::max` no longer optimize well. Tweaking them to bypass `Ord::cmp` removed some regressions, but not much.\r\n\r\nDiving back into the cachegrind diffs and disassembly, I found one huge widespread issue was that the codegen for `Span`'s `hash_stable` regressed because `span_data_to_lines_and_cols` no longer inlined into it, because that function does a lot of `Range<BytePos>::contains`. The implementation of `Range::contains` uses `PartialOrd` multiple times, and we had massively regressed the codegen of `Range::contains`. The root problem here seems to be that `PartialOrd` is derived on `BytePos`, which is a simple wrapper around a `u32`. So for `BytePos`, `PartialOrd::{le, lt, ge, gt}` use the default impls, which go through `PartialOrd::cmp`, and LLVM fails to optimize these combinations of methods with the new `Ord::cmp` implementation. At a guess, the new implementation makes LLVM totally loses track of the fact that `<Ord for u32>::cmp` is an elaborate way to compare two integers.\r\n\r\nSo I have low hopes for this overall, because my strategy (which is working) to recover the regressions is to avoid the \"faster\" implementation that this PR is based around. If we have to settle for an implementation of `Ord::cmp` which is on its own sub-optimal but is optimized better in combination with functions that use its return value in specific ways, so be it. However, one of the runs had an improvement in `coercions`. I don't know if that is jitter or relevant. But I'm still finding threads to pull here, so I'm going to keep at it.\r\n\r\nFor the moment I am hacking up the implementations on `BytePos` instead of modifying the code that `derive(PartialOrd, Ord)` expands to because that would be hard, and it would also mean that we would just expand to more code, perhaps regressing compile time for that reason, even if the generated assembly is more efficient.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHacking up the remainder of the `PartialOrd`/`Ord` methods on `BytePos` took us down to 3 regressions and 6 improvements, which is interesting. All the improvements are in `coercions`, so I'm sure this improved _something_ but whether it matters... hard to say. Based on the findings of @joboet, I'm going to cherry-pick https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/106065 onto this branch, because that strategy seems to improve `PartialOrd::lt` and `PartialOrd::ge` back to the original codegen, even when they are using our new `Ord::cmp` impl. If the remaining perf regressions are due to de-optimizing a `PartialOrd::lt` not on `BytePos`, this might be a further improvement.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOkay, that cherry-pick brought us down to 2 regressions but that might be noise. We still have the same 6 improvements, all on `coercions`.\r\n\r\nI think the next thing to try here is modifying the implementation of `derive(PartialOrd)` to automatically emit the modifications that I made to `BytePos` (directly implementing all the methods for newtypes). But even if that works, I think the effect of this change is so mixed that it's probably not worth merging with current LLVM. What I'm afraid of is that this change currently pessimizes matching on `Ordering`, and that is the most natural thing to do with an enum. So I'm not closing this yet, but I think without a change from LLVM, I have other priorities at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\nr? @ghost", "created_at": "2022-12-17T20:48:02Z", "updated_at":
