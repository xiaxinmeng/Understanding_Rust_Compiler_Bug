It instead gets us ~80% of the way there! The steps taken in this PR are:\n- Landing pads are turned on by default for 64-bit MSVC. The LLVM support is \"good enough\" with the caveat the destructor glue is now marked noinline. This was recommended [on the associated bug](https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=23884) as a stopgap until LLVM has a better representation for exception handling in MSVC. The consequence of this is that MSVC will have a bit of a perf hit, but there are possible routes we can take if this workaround sticks around for too long.\n- The linker (`link.exe`) is now looked up in the Windows Registry if it's not otherwise available in the environment. This improves using the compiler outside of a VS shell (e.g. in a MSYS shell or in a vanilla cmd.exe shell). This also makes cross compiles via Cargo \"just work\" when crossing between 32 and 64 bit!\n- TLS destructors were fixed to start running on MSVC (they previously weren't running at all)\n- A few assorted `run-pass` tests were fixed.\n- The dependency on the `rust_builtin` library was removed entirely for MSVC to try to prevent any `cl.exe` compiled objects get into the standard library. This should help us later remove any dependence on the CRT by the standard library.\n- I re-added `rust_try_msvc_32.ll` for 32-bit MSVC and ensured that landing pads were turned off by default there as well.\n\nDespite landing pads being enabled, there are still _many_ failing tests on MSVC. The two major classes I've identified so far are:\n- Spurious aborts. It appears that when optimizations are enabled that landing pads aren't always lined up properly, and sometimes an exception being thrown can't find the catch block down the stack, causing the program to abort. I've been working to reduce this test case but haven't been met with great success just yet.\n- Parallel codegen does not work on MSVC. Our current strategy is to take the N object files emitted by the N codegen threads and use `ld -r` to assemble them into _one_ object file. The MSVC linker, however, does not have this ability, and this will need to be rearchitected to work on MSVC.\n\nI will fix parallel codegen in a future PR, and I'll also be watching LLVM closely to see if the aborts... disappear!\n", "created_at": "2015-07-02T18:00:21Z", "updated_at": "2015-07-07T00:15:54Z", "closed_at": "2015-07-06T21:22:26Z", "merged_at": "2015-07-06T21:22:26Z",
