Only the field drop glue is suppressed.\r\n\r\nThis PR should essentially fully implement #100344, and is gated behind the feature flag `manually_drop_attr`.\r\n\r\nSome additional notes:\r\n\r\n### The meaning of `#[manually_drop]`\r\n\r\n`#[manually_drop]` means \"do not destroy the fields automatically during destruction\". `ManuallyDrop`, could \"just\", morally speaking, be `#[manually_drop] struct ManuallyDrop<T>(T);`.\r\n\r\nThe intent is, per the MCP, to allow customization of the drop order, without making the interface for initializing or accessing the fields of the struct clumsier than a normal Rust type. It also -- and people did seem excited about this part -- lifts `ManuallyDrop` from being a special language supported feature to just another user of `#[manually_drop]`.\r\n\r\n### Insignificant Drop\r\n\r\nThere is the question of how this interacts with \"insignificant\" drop. I had trouble understanding the comments, but insignificant drop appears to just be a static analysis tool, and not something that changes behavior. (For example, it's used to detect if a language change will reorder drops in a meaningful way -- meaning, reorder the significant drops, not the insignificant ones.) Since it's unlikely to be used for `#[manually_drop]` types, I don't think it matters a whole lot. And where a destructor is defined, it would seem to make sense for `#[manually_drop]` types to match exactly the behavior of `union`, since they both have the shared property that field drop glue is suppressed.\r\n\r\n### Users that expect `adt.is_manually_drop()` <-> \"is `std::mem::ManuallyDrop`\"\r\n\r\nI looked for all locations that queried for `is_manually_drop` in any form, and found two difficult cases which are hardcoded for `ManuallyDrop` in particular.\r\n\r\nThe first is a clippy lint for redundant clones. I don't understand why it special-cases `ManuallyDrop`, and it's almost certainly wrong for it to special-case `#[manually_drop]` types in general. However, without understanding the original rationale, I have trouble figuring the right fix. Perhaps it should simply be deleted altogether.\r\n\r\nThe second is unions -- specifically, the logic for disabling `DerefMut`. `my_union.x.y = z` will automatically dereference `my_union.x` if it implements `DerefMut`, unless it is `ManuallyDrop`, in which case it will not. This is because `ManuallyDrop` is a pointer back to its content, and so this will automatically call `drop` on a probably uninitialized field, and is unsafe.\r\n\r\nThis is true of `ManuallyDrop`, but not necessarily any other `#[manually_drop]` type. I believe the correct fix would, instead, be a way to mark and detect types which are a smart pointer whose pointee is within `self`. See, for example, this playground link:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=76fb22a6214ce453538fc18ec35a839d\r\n\r\nBut that needs to wait for a separate RFC. For now, we apply exactly the same restriction for `ManuallyDrop` and for any other `#[manually_drop]` type, even though it may be confusing.\r\n\r\n## To-do in future PRs\r\n\r\n1.  (Optional) Fix the redundant clone check to correctly handle `#[manually_drop]` structs that aren't `ManuallyDrop`.\r\n2.  When there is more experience with the feature (e.g. in Crubit) create a full RFC based on the MCP, and go through the remainder of the stabilization process. (Also, do things like generalize the union error messages to not specifically mention `ManuallyDrop`, but also mention `#[manually_drop]`. For as long as the feature is unstable, the error messages would be confusing if they referenced it...)", "created_at": "2022-09-08T19:51:28Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-29T12:59:10Z", "closed_at": null,
