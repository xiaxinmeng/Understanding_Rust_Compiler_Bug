I am happy to close this PR and write a full RFC, if necessary.\r\n\r\nI believe this is sound, as `UnsafeCell<T>` does not provide public access to `self.value`, and the accessor methods `get()` and `set()` always refer to item contained within self. Therefore if the contained item can be cloned or copied, I believe the containing Cell should also be able to copied or cloned.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change is to allow the use of `UnsafeCell<T>` in static arrays, using the `[T; N]` syntax. For this syntax to work, `T` must be `Copy`. For example, if we wanted to make an array of `[UnsafeCell<u16>; 128]`, it would be necessary to fully type out the initializer 128 times, which is not desirable, and difficult to do at global scope with a const_fn or macro.\r\n\r\nAs of now, the `#[stable]` attribute is incorrect, and must be fixed before merging. I would also appreciate guidance on how to fill this out.", "created_at": "2018-10-19T16:23:49Z", "updated_at": "2021-03-10T16:27:32Z", "closed_at": "2018-11-13T18:39:24Z", "merged_at": null,
