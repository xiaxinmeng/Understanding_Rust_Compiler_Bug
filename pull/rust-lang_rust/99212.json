It also isn't particularly feasible for me to detect whether items from the implied feature are used and then only suggest updating _or_ removing the `#![feature(..)]` as appropriate, so I always do both.\r\n\r\nThere's some new information in the cross-crate metadata as a result of this change, that's a little unfortunate, but without requiring that the `#[unstable]` and `#[stable]` attributes both contain the implication information, it's necessary: \r\n\r\n```rust\r\n    /// This mapping is necessary unless both the `#[stable]` and `#[unstable]` attributes should\r\n    /// specify their implications (both `implies` and `implied_by`). If only one of the two\r\n    /// attributes do (as in the current implementation, `implied_by` in `#[unstable]`), then this\r\n    /// mapping is necessary for diagnostics. When a \"unnecessary feature attribute\" error is\r\n    /// reported, only the `#[stable]` attribute information is available, so the map is necessary\r\n    /// to know that the feature implies another feature. If it were reversed, and the `#[stable]`\r\n    /// attribute had an `implies` meta item, then a map would be necessary when avoiding a \"use of\r\n    /// unstable feature\" error for a feature that was implied.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also change some comments to documentation comments in the compiler, add a helper for going from a `Span` to a `Span` for the entire line, and fix a incorrect part of the pre-existing stability attribute diagnostics.\r\n\r\ncc @yaahc ", "created_at": "2022-07-13T14:22:01Z", "updated_at": "2023-02-02T17:09:11Z", "closed_at": "2022-07-20T22:19:33Z", "merged_at": "2022-07-20T22:19:33Z", "merge_commit_sha": "857afc75e6ca69cc7dcae36a6fac8c093ee6fa31", "assignee": {"login": "michaelwoerister", "id": 1825894, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjU4OTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1825894?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister", "html_url": "https://github.com/michaelwoerister", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "michaelwoerister", "id": 1825894, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjU4OTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1825894?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister", "html_url": "https://github.com/michaelwoerister", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 211668100, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgxMDA=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-compiler", "name": "T-compiler", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the compiler team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
