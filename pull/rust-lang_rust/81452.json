Failure to use a `Command` is hopefully fairly obvious but it seems friendly to mark this one for the same reason as futures.\r\n\r\nFailure to use a `Child` or `ExitStatus` are more serious.\r\n\r\nOn unix, failure to use a `Child` leaks the process.  It continues running in parallel, even after we have exited (or crashed), possibly interfering with the user's terminal or driveling nonsense into a logfile long after the original event.  In a long-running process, the child will become a zombie when it exits, and accumulation of zombies can prevent the spawning of new children.  IDK what failure to use a `Child` does on Windows but the docs are not encouraging.\r\n\r\nFailure to use an `ExitStatus` is the kind of error-handling bug Rust usually tries to save us from.\r\n\r\n## Contents of this MR\r\n\r\nThe main aim is just to mark these three types `#[must_use]`.  However, I reviewed the documentation and it was missing two of the problems with leaking `Child`.  I also felt `.spawn()` ought to direct the reader to `.status()`.\r\n\r\nMore worryingly, the `#[must_use]` changes revealed that most of the examples were broken.  Most of them leak the `Child` and nearly none of them check the exit status.  So I fixed that.\r\n\r\n### Bugs this revealed in other parts of rust-lang/rust, outside the stdlib\r\n\r\nThe bootstrap wrapper for rustc ignored the status of the `on_fail` command.  Although failing to run it at all produces a panic, I felt that was a bit much for if it simply fails.  So I chose to print a warning to stderr.  We are already failing here, so the shim will exit nonzero in any case.\r\n\r\nTwo tests in `src/ui/test` failed to check the exit status; in one case this is a clear bug.\r\n\r\nThe runtest wrapper failed to check the exit status from two of its invocations of adb.\r\n\r\n## Concern\r\n\r\nDuring a [pre-RFC discussion](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-overhaul-command-for-2021-ed/13755) I was told that adding a `#[must_use]` is not considered a breaking change because it's only a lint.\r\n\r\nBut I worry that this imay be too disruptive a change, given the problems in the stdlib examples themselves, and the rest of the lang tree.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand: almost all of the things that this found in the stdlib were actual bugs - bugs which would have been quite serious in deployed code.  Perhaps it is better to do our community the service of highlighting these problems rather than tolerating them.\r\n\r\nA friend observed that adding these `#[must_use]` would be \"doing the community a favour, but I'm not sure they'll enjoy it\".", "created_at": "2021-01-27T20:18:05Z", "updated_at": "2021-08-24T17:05:20Z", "closed_at": "2021-01-30T20:51:18Z", "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha":
