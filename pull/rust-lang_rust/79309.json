([playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=5be71c537adbcd1a84b9c62d3027c555))\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nAt the moment, when an inline module is inside a block, the `super` keyword refers to the parent module of the block. The result of this is that the inline module has no way to refer to its sibling items inside the block.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn foo() {\r\n    const FOO: u64 = 0;\r\n    mod foo {\r\n        pub use super::FOO; //~ ERROR no `Foo` in the root\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n([playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=2339d8e979dc45a25735b87ad1f85602))\r\n\r\nThe current interpretation of the `super` keyword is theoretically pure, however I want to argue it has practical drawbacks. As well as issues with doctests as per the first example, it means that in general code of the following form is interpreted differently depending on whether it is inside a block:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nconst FOO: u64 = 0;\r\nmod foo {\r\n    pub use super::FOO;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn isolation it seems fair to me to assume that most readers would state this code compiles and that `foo::FOO` can resolve. However, if this code is actually inside a block, it doesn't compile.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Design\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the behaviour of the `super` keyword in examples like the above such that usage inside a module which is a child of (one of more) blocks will attempt to resolve items from those blocks as well as the parent module of those blocks.\r\n\r\nAmbiguity is resolved by always preferring items that are closer to the module in the hierarchy. E.g. in the following example:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nconst FOO: u64 = 0;\r\nfn main() {\r\n    const FOO: u64 = 1;\r\n    mod foo {\r\n        pub use super::FOO;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe item `foo::FOO` will resolve to have the value `1`.\r\n\r\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Breakage \u26a0\ufe0f \r\n\r\nThis example just above is unfortunately also an example where current code could break under these changes. Today the compiler would not see the `FOO` constant which is the child of `main` from its sibling `mod foo`, and so the item `foo::FOO` today would instead resolve to have the value `0`. \r\n\r\n(Assuming, of course, that the snippet just above were not itself wholly inside a block, in which case the compiler today would not consider the `FOO` on the first line either \ud83d\ude43)\r\n\r\nI would argue inline modules inside blocks are rare. (I myself only found this case while testing a macro which created a module and discovering it did not compile when inside a block.) So this breakage is not likely to be widespread. Nevertheless we should assess carefully.\r\n\r\nIf we were to take a conservative approach it should be possible to change this PR to be backwards compatible. I'd propose in that case to push the complete change to the proposed design in this PR via an edition boundary, with a lint to warn of cases that will change.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\nI'm quite happy to throw this PR away in favour of an alternative design. I'll try to list them here as I see them:\r\n\r\n- @petrochenkov has proposed that a `#[transparent] mod foo` could behave as if it did not create a name boundary, which would allow these modules in blocks to share scope with their parent block. (See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79260#issuecomment-731773625)\r\n- @Aaron1011 wrote a pre-RFC on a `fn` modifier in use statements. (See https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-add-fn-path-qualifier/10900)\r\n- Also in that thread was the proposal of plain `use;`. I'd personally prefer it was a new keyword e.g. `use scope::*;` or `use scope::foo;` - that probably needs a new edition though as a new keyword.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] I think it's quite likely a change like this could be worthy of a wider design review. Please feel free to ask me to first present this as an RFC. (I started with the implementation so I could learn about this design and play with it.)\r\n- [ ] Feature gate? (I 100% assume this change will need one.)\r\n- [ ] Make a decision on the backwards-compatibility story, especially if it might want to become part of the 2021 edition.\r\n- [ ] Refactoring in the implementation of this PR - at the moment I kept to the most direct implementation I could find because I'm not familar with the `rustc_resolve` codebase. Please be unafraid to encourage me to rewrite this PR multiple times to get the cleanest result!\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2020-11-22T16:13:38Z", "updated_at": "2021-03-18T16:19:35Z", "closed_at":
