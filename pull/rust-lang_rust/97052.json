This is shown to work in src/test/ui/coercion/silly-box.rs.\r\n\r\nIt may be desirable to support coercing `DynMetadata<T>` in the future (e.g. `DynMetadata<dyn Trait + Sync> -> DynMetadata<dyn Trait>`). This PR does not add this, but it could be added fairly easily by adding a `CoerceUnsized` impl for `DynMetadata` and allowing `DynMetadata` where `TypedMetadata` is checked for here.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Isn't `TypedMetadata<T>` just a type alias for `<T as Pointee>::Metadata`?\r\n\r\nYes and no. The main problem at hand is that `<T as Pointee>::Metadata` no longer remembers what `T` is once the projection has been resolved. `TypedMetadata<T>` then is a \"strongly typed alias\" which reintroduces `T` and provides the ability to implement `CoerceUnsized`, which cannot be directly implemented on a resolved `<T as Pointee>::Metadata`.\r\n\r\nThere is a potential alternative -- instead of getting `impl CoerceUnsized` to work for `TypedMetadata<T>` as a builtin and then using the existing `struct` behavior for `impl CoerceUnsized`, we could teach coercion (and `impl CoerceUnsized`) to recognize the `<T as Pointee>::Metadata` projection and *directly* coerce that (as is currently done in `TypedMetadata<T>`) rather than delegating to the field's `CoerceUnsized` implementation. (However, this may be impractical, as type projections tend to get normalized away.)\r\n\r\nThis would make `TypedMetadata` a pure library type, but it would still be necessary if wanting to coerce/convert `<T as Pointee>::Metadata` in a function body or for some concrete `T`, rather than as a generic struct field.\r\n\r\n#### Why a coercion instead of just a conversion?\r\n\r\nSuch that `SillyBox<T>` can be coerced. (See also the next question.)\r\n\r\nA conversion is fairly simple to write: just `ptr::from_raw_parts` a null data pointer and the metadata, then coerce that.\r\n\r\n#### Why not use `*mut T` instead of `(*mut (), <T as Pointee>::Metadata)`?\r\n\r\nThe short version: because you might not always have a pointer.\r\n\r\nThere are a few reasons you might want to elide storing the actual pointer-to-`T`, or store something other than a pointer alongside the pointee metadata.\r\n\r\nOne such case is if you have some allocation at a statically known location; in this case it could make sense to have a `StaticRef` which just stores the pointee metadata and implements `Deref` by constructing a normal reference from the raw parts of the static location and the stored metadata. Normally such usage would necessarily also know the full concrete type and thus not need to use non-`()` metadata, but situations such as using linker functionality to place a slice at a (linker-known) static address could want to have `StaticRef<[T]>` to avoid re-deriving the linker-provided length multiple times.\r\n\r\nAnother such case is the use of something like an arena allocator, or a compacting allocator, or any storage allocation which doesn't hand out raw pointers and pin the allocated memory. Here, your `ArenaBox<T>`/`ArenaRef<T>` would store the index into the arena (and perhaps additional metadata like a generation) and the pointee metadata, and then you ask the arena to temporarily resolve the `ArenaRef<T>` into a normal `&T`.\r\n\r\nYet another is `StackBox<T>`, which stores a potentially unsized pointee in its own inline memory, allowing for the use of unsized types (such as `dyn Trait`) without indirection by always reserving a fixed max size/align for them on the stack.\r\n\r\nAll of these *could* be serviced by storing the metadata on a dangling pointer; however, this extra stored pointer exists solely to appease the compiler, and not for any actual benefit to the program.", "created_at": "2022-05-15T03:14:49Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-13T13:31:11Z", "closed_at":
