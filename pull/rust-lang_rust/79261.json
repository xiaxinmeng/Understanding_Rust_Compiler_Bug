I can't find any info about that decision being reverted. My understanding is just that it has been forgotten. If there has been a decision on keeping `compare_and_swap` then it's hard to find, and even if this PR does not go through it can act as a place where people can find out about the decision being reverted.\r\n\r\nAtomic operations are hard to understand, very hard. And it does not help that there are multiple similar methods to do compare and swap with. They are so similar that for a reader it might be hard to understand the difference. This PR aims to make that simpler by finally deprecating `compare_and_swap` which is essentially just a more limited version of `compare_exchange`. The documentation is also updated (according to the RFC text) to explain the differences a bit better.\r\n\r\nEven if we decide to not deprecate `compare_and_swap`. I still think the documentation for the atomic operations should be improved to better describe their differences and similarities. And the documentation can be written nicer than the PR currently proposes, but I wanted to start somewhere. Most of it is just copied from the RFC.\r\n\r\nThe documentation for `compare_exchange` and `compare_exchange_weak` indeed describe how they work! The problem is that they are more complex and harder to understand than `compare_and_swap`. So for someone who does not fully grasp this they might fall back to using `compare_and_swap`. Making the documentation outline the similarities and differences might build a bridge for people so they can cross over to the more powerful and sometimes more efficient operations.\r\n\r\nThe conversions I do to avoid the `std` internal deprecation errors are very straight forward `compare_and_swap -> compare_exchange` changes where the orderings are just using the mapping in the new documentation. Only in one place did I use `compare_exchange_weak`. This can probably be improved further. But the goal here was not for those operations to be perfect. Just to not get worse and to allow the deprecation to happen.", "created_at": "2020-11-21T12:25:51Z", "updated_at": "2021-03-27T13:18:59Z", "closed_at": "2020-12-23T12:25:07Z", "merged_at": "2020-12-23T12:25:07Z", "merge_commit_sha": "87eecd40e87cf7e77cee9cfdc79900c83baf6d8f", "assignee": {"login": "Amanieu", "id": 278509, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODUwOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/278509?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu", "html_url": "https://github.com/Amanieu", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "Amanieu", "id": 278509, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODUwOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/278509?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu", "html_url": "https://github.com/Amanieu", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 211668062, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgwNjI=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-libs-api", "name": "T-libs-api", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the library API team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
