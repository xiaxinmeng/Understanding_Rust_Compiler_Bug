It was surprisingly simple to implement. Example:\r\n```\r\nfn foo() -> never {\r\n    let x: never = panic!();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nThe never-type `!` is an essential feature in Rust to make type inference in eg. `match` work:\r\n```\r\nlet x = match some_enum {\r\n    Variant1 => 42u32,\r\n    Variant2 => return true,\r\n    _ => panic!(),\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHere `x` can be inferred to have the type `u32`, because the other two match arms have the type `!`, meaning that they never yield a value that would need to be stored in `x`. So in some sense, `!` is a _primitive type_ that marks control flow.\r\n\r\nCurrently though, you never need to write the `!`, besides the return type of a diverging function. This makes it an \"niche\" or \"advanced\" language feature. With the stabilization of the never-type this might change though.\r\n\r\nThe syntax of using the `!` symbol is **confusing** though, when you first stumble on it as someone learning Rust. Any intuition for what the `!` symbol might mean is misleading, since it's already used with macros, top-level attributes and doc comments in Rust. This is made worse by the fact that you can't even google it. The `!` symbol is just filtered out of any search query, and I even get amusingly unrelated result like hotel bookings when searching for \"Rust !\". \r\n\r\n# Solution Idea\r\n\r\nTo fix that I had the idea introduce a primitive type whose name is what we have been calling this feature since [2016](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1216#issuecomment-236866474): `never`.\r\nActually, it is just a type alias `pub type never = !` in `core::primitive` that is exported in the prelude.\r\nThis should make it fully backwards compatible, since you can use `never` and `!` interchangeably, and the new prelude export is shadowed if somebody made their own type called `never`.\r\n\r\nI changed some return types of core and std functions, and some never-type tests to verify that this proof-of-concept works. To my own surprise, bootstrapping works and all UI tests pass. There was one weird interaction with a stability attribute and one case where I had to use the full path `crate::primitive::never`, indicating that there are issues in some corner cases, but I haven't investigated further.\r\n\r\n# Downsides\r\n\r\nThe biggest downside is that existing stable Rust code should be migrated to `never`, since there shouldn't be two ways to express exactly the same. An edition migration would be a good fit: Warn on 2018 and below, error on 2021. But even if the change is straightforward and probably easy to implement in rustfix, the ecosystem impact should be carefully considered.\r\n\r\nI'd argue it's a relatively small cost, but also only a small gain. \r\nApparently the Syntax for diverging functions has always been low-priority, so it was overlooked in the rush to Rust 1.0, and again ignored in 2018. Even in the long discussion of the [never type RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1216) the syntax was barely mentioned. Though it's said where it comes from ([\"Yes, it was a bottom type, that's what `bot` and the bang sign refer to (`!` is supposed to look like `\u22a5`)\"](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1216#discussion_r34956199)) and [it was decided](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1216#issuecomment-236866474) to call the feature `never`.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that it becomes bad practice to name a variable `never`. You _can_ do it, just like you can name a variable `u32` or `char`, but it will look ugly when syntax highlighters color it like the other primitives. This will impact existing code that uses `never` as a name. I guess it won't be a problem for types, other than someone defining their own `enum never {}` type.\r\n\r\nAlso, diagnostics would need changes. They mention `!` in type errors when `never` is used.\r\n\r\n# What now?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I'm curious what other people think.\r\nDoes this make sense? \r\nIs it to late to make such a change to the never-type? \r\nIs it worth the downsides?\r\n\r\nIf there is interest, should I write a more detailed proposal?\r\n", "created_at": "2020-12-04T19:54:49Z", "updated_at": "2020-12-05T22:30:04Z",
