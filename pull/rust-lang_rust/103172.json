This results in missed\r\noptimizations, because there are some attributes that can be determined via\r\nanalysis of the MIR making up the function body. In particular, `readonly`\r\ncould be applied to most indirectly-passed by-value function arguments\r\n(specifically, those that are freeze and are observed not to be mutated), but\r\nit currently is not.\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces the machinery that allows `rustc` to determine those\r\nattributes. It consists of a query, `deduced_param_attrs`, that, when\r\nevaluated, analyzes the MIR of the function to determine supplementary\r\nattributes. The results of this query for each function are written into the\r\ncrate metadata so that the deduced parameter attributes can be applied to\r\ncross-crate functions. In this patch, we simply check the parameter for\r\nmutations to determine whether the `readonly` attribute should be applied to\r\nparameters that are indirect immutable freeze by-value.  More attributes could\r\nconceivably be deduced in the future: `nocapture` and `noalias` come to mind.\r\n\r\nAdding `readonly` to indirect function parameters where applicable enables some\r\npotential optimizations in LLVM that are discussed in [issue 103103] and [PR\r\n103070] around avoiding stack-to-stack memory copies that appear in functions\r\nlike `core::fmt::Write::write_fmt` and `core::panicking::assert_failed`. These\r\nfunctions pass a large structure unchanged by value to a subfunction that also\r\ndoesn't mutate it. Since the structure in this case is passed as an indirect\r\nparameter, it's a pointer from LLVM's perspective. As a result, the\r\nintermediate copy of the structure that our codegen emits could be optimized\r\naway by LLVM's MemCpyOptimizer if it knew that the pointer is `readonly\r\nnocapture noalias` in both the caller and callee. We already pass `nocapture\r\nnoalias`, but we're missing `readonly`, as we can't determine whether a\r\nby-value parameter is mutated by examining the signature in Rust. I didn't have\r\nmuch success with having LLVM infer the `readonly` attribute, even with fat\r\nLTO; it seems that deducing it at the MIR level is necessary.\r\n\r\nNo large benefits should be expected from this optimization *now*; LLVM needs\r\nsome changes (discussed in [PR 103070]) to more aggressively use the `noalias\r\nnocapture readonly` combination in its alias analysis. I have some LLVM patches\r\nfor these optimizations and have had them looked over. With all the patches\r\napplied locally, I enabled LLVM to remove all the `memcpy`s from the following\r\ncode:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    println!(\"Hello {}\", 3);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is a significant codegen improvement over the status quo. I expect that if this optimization kicks in in multiple places even for such a simple program, then it will apply to Rust code all over the place.\r\n\r\n[issue 103103]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/103103\r\n\r\n[PR 103070]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/103070", "created_at": "2022-10-18T03:00:10Z", "updated_at": "2022-10-23T01:13:43Z", "closed_at": "2022-10-22T05:08:52Z", "merged_at": "2022-10-22T05:08:52Z", "merge_commit_sha": "eecde5850cade0c058dc12330081329b31a826c7", "assignee": {"login": "oli-obk", "id": 332036, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAzNg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332036?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk", "html_url": "https://github.com/oli-obk", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "oli-obk", "id": 332036, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAzNg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332036?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk", "html_url": "https://github.com/oli-obk", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 120005, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAwMDU=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/A-testsuite", "name": "A-testsuite", "color": "f7e101", "default": false, "description": "Area: The testsuite used to check the correctness of rustc"}, {"id": 211668100, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgxMDA=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-compiler", "name": "T-compiler", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the compiler team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
