I rebased @jld's work off the current `master` and started with that.\r\n\r\nI was able to determine that this Travis error (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/45077#issuecomment-336029862) was ultimately caused by `src/librustc_llvm/build.rs` attempting to follow a wrong value in `LLVM_STATIC_STDCPP` (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/45077#issuecomment-352639456).\r\n\r\nI looked at the downstream port for FreeBSD (https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/lang/rust/) and it seems like they do not use `--enable-llvm-static-stdcpp`.\r\n\r\nSince `libc++` is included in the FreeBSD 10+ base system, we don't need to statically link it either?\r\n\r\nSo in b989428f7dec7b52d68bed6a21e9b5b0a8086267 I have set the FreeBSD build to not actually use `LLVM_STATIC_STDCPP`.\r\n\r\nI was able to run `./src/ci/docker/run.sh` with both `dist-i686-freebsd` and `dist-x86_64-freebsd` successfully and in about 1 minute of testing it seemed like the dist-x86_64-freebsd results worked on a FreeBSD 11 system.\r\n\r\nIt should fix #44433, which seems to be affecting many potential users.  Also FreeBSD users should be able to `./x.py build` which should help anyone who wants to upstream fixes for FreeBSD.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\nDoes this approach seem to be the right way to go? Do we actually really want to statically link `libc++`? (I tried that here, but it ultimately ran into a roadblock on x86_64: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/45077#issuecomment-353293414)\r\n\r\nCan we rewrite the comment here to be more clear about why some systems aren't going to actually use this option:\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b989428f7dec7b52d68bed6a21e9b5b0a8086267/src/bootstrap/compile.rs#L550-L553\r\n\r\nHow does this affect users of older FreeBSD systems? It seemed like no one was complaining about using a 10.3 base version in the thread for #45077.  FreeBSD seems to only officially support 10.3, 10.4, and 11.x right now, do we have to consider older users? The `libc++` stuff came in for FreeBSD 10, older FreeBSD used `libstdc++`.\r\n\r\nLooks like @alexcrichton was leading the discussion on the previous issue:\r\n\r\nr? @alexcrichton\r\n\r\nLet me know what I can do to help get this through.", "created_at": "2017-12-22T09:16:40Z", "updated_at": "2017-12-26T23:11:38Z", "closed_at": "2017-12-26T13:53:49Z", "merged_at": "2017-12-26T13:53:49Z",
