I believe this to be justified in that `Cleanup` is only ever used exactly once as an RAII handle, and is never passed to any FFI function.\n\nTwo tests including to ensure the lint triggers when `#[unsafe_no_drop_flag]` is missing, and does not trigger if it is present.\n\nAddresses rust-lang/rust#18380.\n", "created_at": "2015-02-08T05:35:52Z", "updated_at": "2015-05-01T17:25:58Z",
