These updates are based on [lessons learned](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72808#discussion_r475911543) from the design of `LineWriterShim`, as well as some discussions with @workingjubilee on this topic.\r\n\r\nThere are three main changes to how `BufWriter` works:\r\n\r\n- `write_all` now fully fills the buffer before flushing. Previously, it would fill the buffer as much as possible without splitting any incoming writes. However, we assume that a caller of `write_all` is foremost interested in minimizing write calls to the underlying device, which we can best achieve by maximizing the size of buffers we flush. Of course, incoming data that exceeds the *total* size of the buffer is still forwarded directly to the underlying device.\r\n    - Conversely, we assume that a caller of `write` would prefer to have unbroken writes if possible (that is, would prefer `Ok(n)` where `n == buf.len()`). The implementation of `write` is therefore left unchanged with regard to buffer filling.\r\n- `write_vectored` is unchanged when `inner.is_write_vectored()`. However, in the case where the underlying device doesn't offer any specialization, we now take care to buffer together all the incoming sub-bufs, even if the *total* size exceeds our buffer, and only fall back to directly forwarded writes in the case that an *individual* slice exceeds our buffer size. As a result, `BufWriter` now also unconditionally returns `true` for `is_write_vectored`.\r\n- Added `flush_buf_vectored()`, a new internal method that is similar to `flush_buf`, but additionally attempts to use vectored operations to send the new incoming data along with the existing buffered data in a single operation. I took care to ensure that this never results in more system calls than it would have already; in particular, it immediately stops forwarding as soon as the existing buffer is fully forwarded, even if 0 new bytes have been sent. `write` and `write_all` were refactored to take advantage of it, and `write_vectored` was slightly modified to forward to `write` if exactly 1 buffer is being written.\r\n- Additionally, as a much more minor change, removed several unnecessary uses of the `self.panicked` guard fences. `BufWriter::panicked` is about preventing duplicate writes of buffered data, so it isn't necessary to fence writes to the underlying device when the buffer is known to be empty.\r\n\r\n# Follow up items\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n- [x] Test the new behavior\r\n\r\n## Open questions\r\n\r\nStuff I want to call out and ensure is addressed in review:\r\n\r\n- [x] Do the assumptions underpinning the `BufWriter` changes make sense.\r\n- [x] Would it make sense for `BufWriter` to unconditionally return `true` for `is_write_buffered`, since it specializes vectored writes by buffering them together, even when the underlying device offers no such specialization?\r\n\r\nThis was split off to a separate PR from #78515", "created_at": "2020-10-30T02:30:40Z", "updated_at": "2021-03-02T01:17:56Z", "closed_at": "2021-03-02T01:17:44Z", "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha": "c33bb9d53c1e327c2c4b844313e4039ca18beccb", "assignee": {"login": "joshtriplett", "id": 162737, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjczNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162737?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett", "html_url": "https://github.com/joshtriplett", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "joshtriplett", "id": 162737, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjczNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162737?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett", "html_url": "https://github.com/joshtriplett", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 211668062, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgwNjI=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-libs-api", "name": "T-libs-api", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the library API team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 627350354, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw2MjczNTAzNTQ=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-inactive", "name": "S-inactive", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Inactive and waiting on the author.
