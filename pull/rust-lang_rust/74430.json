It's also a pretty niche bug so while I expect it to land soon I don't think we need to block stabilization on it anyway.</s>\r\n - Non-identifier primitive types like slices: This was not a part of the original RFC anyway, and is a pretty niche use case\r\n\r\n\r\nThe feature itself, sans https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65983, has been shipped on nightly for three years now, with people using it on docs.rs. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65983 itself is not an overwhelmingly central bit of functionality; the reason we elected to block stabilization on it was that back in 2017 it was not possible to fix the issue without some major refactorings of resolve, and we did not want to stabilize something that had such a potentially unfixable bug.\r\n\r\nGiven that we've fixed it, I see no reason to delay stabilization on this long awaited feature. It's possible that the latest patches have problems, however we _have_ done crater runs of some of the crucial parts. Furthermore, that's what the release trains are for, we will have a solid three months to let it ride the trains before it actually hits the stable compiler.\r\n\r\n\r\nr? @rust-lang/rustdoc", "created_at": "2020-07-17T07:19:52Z", "updated_at": "2020-09-29T06:18:08Z", "closed_at": "2020-09-24T05:58:43Z", "merged_at": "2020-09-24T05:58:43Z", "merge_commit_sha": "78a089487b5f6d5e4205ac4500410b442857bced", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 203738, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM3Mzg=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-rustdoc", "name": "T-rustdoc", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the rustdoc team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 223796632, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMjM3OTY2MzI=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/relnotes", "name": "relnotes", "color": "fad8c7", "default": false, "description": "Marks issues that should be documented in the release notes of the next release."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
