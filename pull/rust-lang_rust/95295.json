I am wholy spiritually defeated by the fact that _liballoc_ of all places is getting this stuff wrong. This isn't throwing shade at the folks who implemented these Rc features, but rather a statement of how impractical it is to expect anyone out in the wider ecosystem to enforce them if _some of the most audited rust code in the library that defines the very notion of allocating memory_ can't even reliably do it.\r\n> \r\n> We need the nuclear option of Layout enforcing this rule. Code that breaks this rule is _deeply_ broken and any \"regressions\" from changing Layout's contract is a _correctness_ fix. Anyone who disagrees and is sufficiently motivated can go around our backs but the standard library should 100% refuse to enable them.\r\n\r\ncc also @RalfJung @rust-lang/wg-allocators. Even though this technically supersedes #95252, those potential failure points should almost certainly still get nicer panics than just \"unwrap failed\" (which they would get by this PR).\r\n\r\nIt might additionally be worth recommending to users of the `Layout` API that they should ideally use `.and_then`/`?` to complete the entire layout calculation, and then `panic!` from a single location at the end of `Layout` manipulation, to reduce the overhead of the checks and optimizations preserving the exact location of each `panic` which are conceptually just one failure: allocation too big.\r\n\r\nProbably deserves a T-lang and/or T-libs-api FCP (this technically solidifies the [objects must be no larger than `isize::MAX`](https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/layout/scalars.html#isize-and-usize) rule further, and the UCG document says this hasn't been RFCd) and a crater run. Ideally, no code exists that will start failing with this addition; if it does, it was _likely_ (but not certainly) causing UB.\r\n\r\nChanges the raw_vec allocation path, thus deserves a perf run as well.\r\n\r\nI suggest hiding whitespace-only changes in the diff view.", "created_at": "2022-03-25T05:01:51Z", "updated_at": "2022-10-18T15:32:12Z", "closed_at": "2022-07-10T11:35:18Z", "merged_at": "2022-07-10T11:35:18Z", "merge_commit_sha": "4ec97d991b1bd86dc89fee761d79ac8e85239a08", "assignee": {"login": "joshtriplett", "id": 162737, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjczNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162737?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett", "html_url": "https://github.com/joshtriplett", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "joshtriplett", "id": 162737, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjczNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162737?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett", "html_url": "https://github.com/joshtriplett", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 129836139, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMjk4MzYxMzk=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/A-allocators", "name": "A-allocators", "color": "f7e101", "default": false, "description": "Area: Custom and system allocators"}, {"id": 211668062, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTE2NjgwNjI=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/T-libs-api", "name": "T-libs-api", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "Relevant to the library API team, which will review and decide on the PR/issue."}, {"id": 223796632, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMjM3OTY2MzI=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/relnotes", "name": "relnotes", "color": "fad8c7", "default": false, "description": "Marks issues that should be documented in the release notes of the next release."}, {"id": 583437191, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MzcxOTE=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/labels/S-waiting-on-bors", "name": "S-waiting-on-bors", "color": "d3dddd", "default": false, "description": "Status: Waiting on bors to run and complete tests.
