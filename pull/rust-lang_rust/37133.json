Unconventional here means: no networking, no filesystem, no environment and in general no system calls. Think OS kernel but different: you do want allocation and collections, you do want floating point numbers, you do want standard Rust abstractions such as `io::Write`, etc. Using `no_std` is really inconvenient in these situations because a lot of std is missing. Examples of such environments are emscripten\u00b9 and [Intel SGX](https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx).\n\nThis PR adds a `target_os = \"none\"` configuration. The approach I've taken is to base everything of off the `unix` base, removing the dependency on `libc`, and returning errors from all functions that used libc. I've borrowed some ideas from the Linux and emscripten implementations here and there.\n\nIn some places the existing unix code needed only minor modifications and `#[cfg()]` additions, in these cases I've modified the files inline. In other cases, it made more sense to reimplement the sys API in a new file. See [libstd/sys/none/mod.rs](https://github.com/jethrogb/rust/blob/no_os/src/libstd/sys/none/mod.rs).\n\nIn general these areas have been modified:\n- `fs` just mostly return io::Error. UNIX-compatible Path/OsString handling is still supported\n- `net` just mostly return io::Error. Addressing structures are still supported\n- `process` just mostly return io::Error\n- `env` just mostly return io::Error\n- `thread` just mostly return io::Error (note `std::thread::spawn` calls unwrap internally...)\n- `stdio` use \"fake stdio\" as is used on Windows when there is no console\n- `sync` replace all primitives with single-threaded primitives without any locking. If you do somehow end up in a multi-threaded environment, this means things are totally and utterly racy and unsafe.\n- `time` `SystemTime` is like the Linux version and you can do time math, but calling `now` will panic.\n\nI'm aware that the current state of the PR is nowhere near merging. I just want to announce my plans and solicit feedback. I already know that the following things need work:\n- tests. I have not tried to run any tests yet. It's not even clear how to run tests as there is no generic way to run binaries compiled for this target. Even if there were, I imagine many tests are going to fail. What would be a good approach to handling this?\n- formatting. I'm pretty sure that I'm not adhering to proper style everywhere\n- copyright headers for new files. These will be added later\n- librustc_back target. For now you need to use the [JSON target file](https://github.com/jethrogb/rust/blob/x86_64-unknown-none-gnu/x86_64-unknown-none-gnu.json).\n\nRather, I'm looking for technical feedback.\n\nYou can build this branch like so:\n\n```\nRUST_TARGET_PATH=/somewhere cargo rustc --lib --release --target x86_64-unknown-none-gnu --manifest-path src/rustc/std_shim/Cargo.toml\n```\n\nYou can then link the `deps` directory to the approriate `lib/rustlib` in your rust installation to test building with this target. Here's what you need to supply to make it link:\n- an allocator crate\n- `rlibc` or similar\n- an implementation for `extern fn getrandom(buf: *mut u8, len: usize);`\n\nI made a [sample application](https://github.com/jethrogb/rust/tree/x86_64-unknown-none-gnu) that takes this std and adds some Linux system calls around it, it works.\n\n\u00b9: If I understand the state of the emscripten port correctly based on discussions with @brson, if you're trying to use functionality that doesn't exist on the platform you'll just get linker errors. That's of course not very ergonomic.\n\nr? @brson\n", "created_at": "2016-10-12T23:41:51Z", "updated_at": "2016-11-28T21:53:45Z", "closed_at": "2016-11-28T21:53:45Z", "merged_at": null,
