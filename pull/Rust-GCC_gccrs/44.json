If you are not familiar with the `cfg` attribute, it is used for conditional compilation, and more information can be found on it [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html).\r\n\r\nNote that this is _not_ a finalised implementation of `cfg` attribute handling - other, somewhat less important defines, such as the ones related to the availability of atomic integers of various sizes, have not been added yet. However, I thought that this PR was already big enough and took long enough to code without taking the time to investigate GCC's atomic support, so I settled on just adding target defines for each platform supported by GCC.\r\n\r\nI am so sorry about the size of this PR, but I thought it would be better that the defines worked on all platforms before merging, and I grossly underestimated the amount of platforms supported by GCC. I'm not sure if it would be possible to break this up into smaller PRs without significant work because I made subsequent improvements to earlier target hooks after learning more about GCC's internals as I went along.", "created_at": "2020-08-12T14:06:19Z", "updated_at": "2020-08-15T13:58:38Z", "closed_at": "2020-08-15T13:58:38Z", "merged_at": "2020-08-15T13:58:38Z", "merge_commit_sha":
