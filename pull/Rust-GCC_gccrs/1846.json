Added node. Please tell me if there is anything more I could add to this class definition. Below I explain a few decisions and a few doubts I had regarding a few identifiers in the rustc code and their equivalent in gccrs.\r\n\r\nIn the rustc compiler, the Inline ASM node has been implemented [here](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/asm.html#ast)\r\n\r\nI have done what I could to mimic its properties. In rust, we can have enums with different implementations. Like here, if It's an InlineAsm operand, It could be IN with 2 attributes, while if it were OUT it would have 3 attributes, so I implemented each of these as separate structs.\r\n \r\nThere are a few things I still need clarification on. Like the identifiers: options and span(this is analogous to the scope from exploring the rustc compiler further), and am particularly struggling with these lines to find its equivalent cpp code.\r\n\r\n` pub template_strs: Box<[(Symbol, Option<Symbol>, Span)]> `\r\n`pub clobber_abi: Option<(Symbol, Span)>`\r\n\r\nI have also added location data to the following structs, though no such thing was done in the rustc implementation because it might be helpful later\r\n- InlineAsmSym\r\n- InlineAsmRegOrClass\r\n- InlineAsmPlaceHolder\r\n- InlineAsmTemplatePiece (I didn't add this one yet, if you agree to the above, I'll add location data here too)\r\n\r\nI also experimented with adding visitors, that's why there are changes in the following files, as I was asked just to create the class I will remove these changes in my final PR:\r\n- gcc/rust/ast/rust-ast-visitor.h\r\n- gcc/rust/ast/rust-ast-full-test.cc\r\n- gcc/rust/resolve/rust-early-name-resolver.cc\r\n-
