The right angle brackets at the end of generics should also be disambiguated in a better way now - token \"splitting\" instead of just \"replacing\". Also, match expression parsing and also AST storage/modelling of it was improved to be closer to the spec, faster, and simpler.\r\n\r\nIt also converts the parser to a template class (over a \"ManagedTokenSource\" type rather than the Lexer class in particular) in anticipation of the macro expansion code, which will require the parser to operate on tokens from a token stream (rather than tokens lexed from characters in the lexer) - I considered templating a better option than using a polymorphic \"ManagedTokenSource\" (which would be too slow) or misusing the Lexer (which would be dodgy and buggy). As the parser is a template class, its implementation had to be moved to a header file.", "created_at": "2020-10-01T14:11:00Z", "updated_at": "2020-10-03T16:03:51Z", "closed_at":
