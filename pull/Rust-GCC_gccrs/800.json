The configurations follow the same ones as shown in the reference repo specified by @philberty in the issue.\r\n\r\nThe linter works great, and the Test is shown as unsuccessful if a check fails. I also created a PR ( [here](https://github.com/mvvsmk/gccrs/pull/1) )in my fork to test this.  You can check the results out [here.](https://github.com/mvvsmk/gccrs/runs/4126281781?check_suite_focus=true) The test file's name is TEST.md .\r\n\r\nPlease note that the run mentioned above also shows errors in CONTRIBUTING.md and README.md, which were not part of the commit, but the linter goes over them regardless, as they are part of the Repository.\r\n\r\n### The issues that still remain are :\r\n\r\n- There are two files CONTRIBUTING.md and README.md which have a few errors, I could configure the linter to skip them, but it would be much easier to correct them.\r\n- The trigger branch for the workflow was not specified. Hence I use master.\r\n- Custom configurations/changes you would like me to add.\r\n\r\nThis is my first PR, so please let me know if I've missed anything!
