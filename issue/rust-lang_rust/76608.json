So as it stands, the tradeoff is probably not worth it, especially since most of the time you aren't looking at `debug!` logging.\r\n\r\nHowever, having `debug!` completely compiled out is extremely confusing the first time you go to add a `debug!`. While rustc-dev-guide can work on making this more discoverable, ideally this would always be on so you don't have to worry about it. I would _love_ to get the perf impact low enough that this can be on by default (or even always on).\r\n\r\nOne possible way to work towards this is by moving the more verbose logging to `trace!` and compiling out _trace_ instead. This allows keeping the (truly stupendous) amount of logging currently, but still making `debug!` work by default. Since `trace!` is rarely used, I expect this to be much less confusing for new contributors.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @jyn514 in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76588#discussion_r486707633_", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76608/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76608/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
