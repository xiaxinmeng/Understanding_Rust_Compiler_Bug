The easiest thing I can think of is to use a URI-like fragment-specifier: `path/to/pkgid#version`. Then `version` is passed through somewhat directly to the underlying fetch mechanism (as a revision identifier -- either a tag/ref or a hash) and is mapped into a (sub)directory when checking out and building packages. We can start with specific revisions and extend to accepting revision-ranges (say, separated by `..`) in dependency requirements at some point if we find this is something people want.\n\nNote that this is not in opposition to using [semvers](semver.org). We should encourage revision tags that are semvers. But users will occasionally want or need to refer to non-semver tags:\n- Users who just want `HEAD` of some repo, while doing development\n- Users who need a specific ref (by content-hash) that has no associated semver\n\nWe can (probably?) differentiate cases using the following algorithm (though it's getting tight):\n- Split any version-specifier at a `..` pair. If there's such a pair, it's a version range. If not, it's a single version.\n- If there is a `.` in a version, try to parse it as a semver.\n- If not, or if semver-parsing fails, consider it as an exact VCS revision identifier (tag, ref, etc.)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "catamorphism", "id": 427212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzIxMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/427212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism", "html_url": "https://github.com/catamorphism", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/5684/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/5684/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
