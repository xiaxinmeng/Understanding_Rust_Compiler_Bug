As such, please consider the plight of C/C++ developers learning and porting large bodies of C/C++ code to Rust.\r\n\r\nWhile Rust shouldn't aim to be a better C/C++, please try to inform C/C++ developers where their C/C++-isms won't work, wherever possible. In fact, I'd argue that suggested fixes should come before explanations in error messages.\r\n\r\nI spent 4 hours on the issue above, reading docs, SO issues, rewrote the code 4-5 times. Checked to see if I was running the latest compiler version, installed half a dozen Rust addins for VSCode to hope that one of them could tell me what I was doing wrong, etc. \r\n\r\nAt no point did I ever consider that the error was caused by a terminating semicolon! \ud83d\ude20 \r\n\r\nAnd it was all because Rust has a rule that a semicolon should suppress the result of an expression.\r\n\r\nIn which case ...\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet foo = 2;\r\n```\r\n... shouldn't set `foo` to `2` because the `;` should return the nil expression, no? Isn't this an inconsistent application of the semicolon rule?\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.48.0 (7eac88abb 2020-11-16)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 7eac88abb2e57e752f3302f02be5f3ce3d7adfb4\r\ncommit-date: 2020-11-16\r\nhost: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\r\nrelease: 1.48.0\r\nLLVM version: 11.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a backtrace in the code block by setting `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` in your\r\nenvironment.
