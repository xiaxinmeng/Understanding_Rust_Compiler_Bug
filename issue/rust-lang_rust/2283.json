I debugged this a bit by building a vanilla compiler in another repoistory and managed to trace it as far as a failure in `make_mono_id()` because the call to `map2()` that is processing bounds and substs receives a bounds vec of length 1 and a substs vec of length 2.  This seems to occur with the call to `vec::flatmap()` that occurs in librustsyntax processing the attributes.  I tried to narrow down the test to a smaller test file but was unable to find anything that reproduced the error other than the full rustc.\n\n@marijnh if you wouldn't mind taking a look and let me know if something jumps out at you, I would appreciate it.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "marijnh", "id": 144427, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144427?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh", "html_url": "https://github.com/marijnh", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2283/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2283/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
