When I looked into it I found that the rlibs were not bit-identical despite being built from the same source. Most of the differences were in the debug info because the current directory winds up encoded there. I tried using `-Zremap-path-prefix-from=... -Zremap-path-prefix-to=...` which removed most of the differences but not all. A small difference in the metadata remains, which from looking at the diff of the serialized metadata @eddyb said was the [SVH](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/6c04c41034c46730fba97bfe9cfa2dd0687c2a5f/src/librustc_metadata/schema.rs#L189). @michaelwoerister: do you know why this would be?\r\n\r\nI built this [test crate](https://github.com/luser/snippet) twice in different directories using the [test-build.sh](https://github.com/luser/snippet/blob/master/test-build.sh) script.
