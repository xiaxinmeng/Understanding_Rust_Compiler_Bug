For example,\n\n``` rust\nmacro_rules! m { () => { let x = 0; } }\n\nmacro_rules! n { () => {\n    let y = 0;\n    m!() // Since `m!()` expands into statements, this is ok\n}}\n\nfn main() {\n    n!();\n    let x = 0;\n    m!() // Since `m!()` expands into an expression, this is not ok\n}\n```\n\nOne way to fix this is to make all trailing expression statement macros expand into statements.\nWhen (if?) #34706 gets fixed, this will be backwards compatible. However, today it isn't:\n\n``` rust\nmacro_rules! m { () => { 1; } }\nfn f() -> i32 {\n    m!() // The trailing semicolon on `1` is ignored today, so this typechecks.\n         // If `m!()` were expanded into statements, the trailing semicolon\n         // would not be ignored, so this would break.\n}\n```\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34707/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34707/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
