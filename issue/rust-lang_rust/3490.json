The actual effect system that's being enforced is a BIT subtle.  I would prefer to implement a separate purityck later that is modeling the underlying effect system more directly.  This would not only be less complex in the implementation, it would give me more confidence we are enforcing the rules we want to enforce.\n\nHere is an example of some code which may or may not be safe:\n\n```\nuse std;\n\nfn main()\n{\n    let a = ~[1, 4, 3, 5, 2];\n    let mut compare_count = 0;\n\n    std::sort::quick_sort(|x, y| { compare_count += 1; *x < *y }, a);\n\n    error!(\"%d comparisons\", compare_count);\n    error!(\"%?\", a);\n}\n```\n\nTo answer whether it's safe requires me to (1) reconstruct the mental model of purity I had in mind; (2) check whether this conforms.  I'm deferring step (1) for the moment until I get back to this bug.  \n\nHere are some [further notes I wrote down at some point](https://gist.github.com/3718481) regarding how our rules map to an underlyling effect system.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3490/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3490/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
