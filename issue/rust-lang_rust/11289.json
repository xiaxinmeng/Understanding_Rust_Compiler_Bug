E.g. in an Autoconf or CMake based system you'd simply do:\n\n```\n./configure --exec-prefix rustpkg_workspace/<build_triple>\ncmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=rustpkg_workspace/<build_triple>\n```\n\nRight now you'd have to do something like this instead:\n\n```\n./configure --bindir rustpkg_workspace/bin/<build_triple> --libdir rustpkg_workspace/lib/<build_triple>\n# CMake doesn't have an option to do this by default\n```\n\nWhich is somewhat less convenient. There's still a question of where to obtain a rustc compatible target triple, but it's a separate issue.\n\nAlong the same lines, the default rustc search path could be modified to look for `<build_triple>/lib` instead of `lib/<build_triple>`.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "emberian", "id": 704250, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDI1MA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/704250?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian", "html_url": "https://github.com/emberian", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11289/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11289/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
