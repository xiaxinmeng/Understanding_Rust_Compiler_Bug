"While attempting to compile my application (or simply run `cargo check`), rustc will crash, with slightly different results depending on whether it's the stable or nightly branch. \r\n\r\n**OS**: Windows 10 x64 version 1809 build 17763.253\r\n\r\n### stable toolchain\r\n- stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\r\n- rustc 1.32.0 (9fda7c223 2019-01-16)\r\n\r\n**`cargo check` result:** `thread 'main' has

-1`\r\n\r\n**Repro steps**\r\n- Same as above, but on the master branch\r\n\r\n#### Suspected cause\r\n\r\nI've narrowed down the issue to a [procedural macro](https://github.com/bgourlie/rs-nes/blob/master/rs-nes-macros/src/lib.rs) that I've had no issues compiling in the past (on nightly). It generates a large match statement which made me think that [this recent change](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/57494) may be related, but I have no evidence to support it other than the fact that it changes how the compiler behaves wrt large match statements. \r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that I created the `remove-unstable-features` branch specifically to see if this was only an issue on nightly. It's possible that the error seen on stable is a manifestation of not using unstable features I had been relying on (box patterns, in this case).\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57735/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57735/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
