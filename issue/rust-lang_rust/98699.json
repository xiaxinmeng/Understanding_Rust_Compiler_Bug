In that\r\ncase, you can use use `issue = \"none\"` in your initial implementation PR. The\r\nreviewer will ask you to open a tracking issue if they agree your feature can be\r\nadded without an RFC.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFeature gate: `#![feature(os_fd)]`\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for the `std::os::fd` module, which is currently defined on\r\nboth Unix and WASI , and contains `OwnedFd`, `BorrowedFd`, `RawFd`, `AsFd`,\r\n`AsRawFd`, `IntoRawFd`, and `FromRawFd`.\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\nThe types and traits are the same as those already defined in `std::os::unix::io`\r\nand `std::os::wasi::io`. This PR is just introducing a new alias for them to help\r\nusers write portable code.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// in std::os\r\n\r\n#[cfg(any(unix, target_os = \"wasi\"))]\r\npub mod fd {\r\n    pub type RawFd = ...;\r\n    pub struct OwnedFd { ... }\r\n    pub struct BorrowedFd<'a> { ... }\r\n\r\n    pub trait AsFd { ... }\r\n    pub trait AsRawFd { ... }\r\n    pub trait IntoRawFd { ... }\r\n    pub trait FromRawFd { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor larger features, more steps might be involved.\r\nIf the feature is changed later, please add those PRs here as well.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Implementation: #98368\r\n- [ ] Final comment period (FCP)\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOnce the feature has gone through a few release cycles and there are no\r\nunresolved questions left, the feature might be ready for stabilization.\r\n\r\nIf this feature didn't go through the RFC process, a final comment period\r\n(FCP) is always needed before stabilization. This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library API team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncomment period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n - \"fd\" isn't literally an \"os\", yet this proposes having it as a public module under\r\n`std::os`. One can think of it as meaning \"OS's that use fds\". Is that weird?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/98699/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/98699/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
