At first I thought the hash was of some file contents, to ensure that unstable stuff doesn't get linked to. but that's not the case. The hash is only of the version string, and contains no extra information:\n\n```\nmk/main.mk:CFG_FILENAME_EXTRA=$(shell printf '%s' $(CFG_RELEASE) | $(CFG_HASH_COMMAND))}\n```\n\nI'm wondering if we can change it simply to `CFG_FILENAME_EXTRA = $(CFG_RELEASE)` instead? It seems reasonable to me, since it is only filename changes. It would make it more human-readable too, and open up the possibility of comparing the values to figure out which is newer.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28120/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28120/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
