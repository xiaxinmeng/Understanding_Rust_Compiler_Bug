Here is why:\n\nA warning is only useful when it is actionable. \u201cYou should not do this\u201d is ideally accompanied by \u201cdo that instead\u201d. Maintainers fix their code and the warning goes away. But this is not the case of most unstable warnings, there is not yet a stable equivalent of the functionality. Therefore, in order to find the few actionable warnings or just not be drowned in the sheer amount of output, maintainers are lead to add `#![allow(unstable)]` to their crates. This is not great, because they (or at least I) are likely to forget to remove it when unstable warnings become useful.\n\nCC @alexcrichton \n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21084/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21084/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
