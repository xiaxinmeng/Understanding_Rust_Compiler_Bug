As such `x.py tidy` does not report these lines and allows them to be merged into the repository without issue.\r\n\r\nI tried enabling some `rustfmt` options to reformat comments but the results are suboptimal in many situations. For the time being, it would probably be best if `tidy` were taught to check for this issue itself.\r\n\r\nSee [this Zulip thread](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/182449-t-compiler.2Fhelp/topic/tidy.20line.20lengths) for more details.
