Like `expect` and `unwrap` of `core::option::Option` and `core::result::Result`.\n\nI found two primary things about this:\n- [RFC: rename fail! to panic!](https://github.com/aturon/rfcs/blob/panic/active/0000-panic.md) ([issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/221))\n- [Common container/wrapper methods [RFC]](http://aturon.github.io/style/naming/containers.html) ([issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/9784), [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/13159))\n\nSeems like some of fail (panic) methods will be preserved (like `expect` for a `Option<V>`). But using of such methods is highly error-prone.\n\nTo prevent mass usage of them I suggest to mark such methods as `unsafe`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nunsafe fn expect(self, msg: &str) -> T\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/17650/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/17650/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
