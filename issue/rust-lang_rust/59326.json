I'm working on creating one but it seems tricky. \r\n\r\nThe compiler is complaining about `[E0308]: mismatched types` where it said it's expecting for a trait `SomeTrait<Apple=SomeApple, Apple=SomeApple, Banana=SomeBanana, Banana=SomeBanana>` but got `SomeTrait<Apple=SomeAPple, Banana=SomeBanana>`. Only some of the associated types in that trait are repeated once and there are few others are not repeated.\r\n\r\nThe example I gave in #59324 is an intermediate result of my attempt to create a minimal reproducible code to this issue. The type mismatch happened at the `with_factory` method when resolving concrete type for `ThriftService`.\r\n\r\nThe error happened when I'm doing the update from 1.32.0 to 1.33.0 so it's clearly a regression. \r\n\r\nAlso, please let me know if you have any suggestion on bypassing this problem or tips on re-creating the problematic code.\r\n\r\nThanks.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/59326/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/59326/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
