Contributing to Rust\r\n>\r\n> Thank you for your interest in contributing to Rust!\r\n>\r\n> To get started, read the [Getting Started] guide in the [rustc-dev-guide].\r\n\r\nPerhaps it could be a little better. What throws me off in this last sentence, is the term `rustc`. I'm just a total newbie and just getting to know the terms in this language, so there's no surprise that I can't explain why I am sent one place or another for documentation. So, this is more of a question to those familiar with the constellation of terms, repositories, web sites, and so on. Could this reference explain why it refers to `rustc-dev-guide` and not anything else. I want to contribute to documentation of what seems to be a core macro (#77100). So, I'm not sure that reading the \"Guide to Rustc Development\" would be the correct thing to do (even thought I will surely personally read it at some point). The readme of this repository writes:\r\n\r\n> This is the main source code repository for Rust. It contains the compiler, standard library, and documentation.\r\n\r\nSo, in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, I expect to be directed to instructions on contributing to all or any of the compiler, standard library and documentation. But I am directed to what seems to be \u2014 at least by title alone (I haven't read into it, yet) \u2014 solely about contributing to the rust compiler.\r\n\r\nAny suggestion regarding how to improve this \u2014 I have the intention of implementing myself. By the way, I am streaming my contribution to rust live at https://twitch.tv/mightyiam.\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"henryboisdequin\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77215/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77215/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
