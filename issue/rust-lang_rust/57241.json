These operations are already stable in `const`/`static`, and are also being promoted on stable (`&(1.2*2.1)` has lifetime `'static`). However, in all of these situations, the code is *definitely* executed at compile-time -- only `const fn` code could be executed *both* at compile-time and run-time, making possible differences in FP behavior observable.
