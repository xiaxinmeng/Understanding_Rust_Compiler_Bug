This guarantees that calling `BufReader::into_inner()` immediately after a seek yields the underlying reader at the same position.\r\n\r\nand this is true both with implementation of `BufReader` on [the current stable](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/io/buffered/bufreader.rs.html#370-393) (1.53.0 as of the time of writing) and on [the current nightly](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/798baebde1fe77e5a660490ec64e727a5d79970d/library/std/src/io/buffered/bufreader.rs#L370-L393) (798baebde1fe77e5a660490ec64e727a5d79970d as of the time of writing).\r\n\r\nHowever, this rationale does not apply when seeking to `SeekFrom::Current(0)`, which is commonly used to find the current seek position in a stream. A program that repeatedly obtains the seek position will repeatedly flush the buffer and lose many of the benefits associated with having a `BufReader` in the first place. Instead, since `SeekFrom::Current(0)` does not change the position of the Seek cursor, `BufReader` can get the current position via `self.inner.seek(SeekFrom::Current(0))` and return this result, avoiding flushing the buffer (and its associated performance costs).\r\n\r\nIf you would like actual code where this issue arises, please let me know and I can follow up with sample code in which using `BufReader` is several times slower than direct reads.\r\n\r\n(I consider this to be a performance bug, but if this would be more appropriate as a feature request, please let me know so that I can repost this to the correct forum(s).)", "closed_by": {"login": "rlee287", "id": 14067959, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDY3OTU5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14067959?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rlee287", "html_url": "https://github.com/rlee287", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rlee287/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rlee287/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rlee287/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rlee287/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rlee287/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rlee287/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rlee287/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rlee287/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rlee287/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86832/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86832/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
