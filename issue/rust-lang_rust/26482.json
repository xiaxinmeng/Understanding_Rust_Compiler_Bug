If no operator is specified, this is the default requirement (e.g. 1.3 is the same as ^1.3).\n```\n\nWhich differs from npm, from https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver :\n\n```\n= Equal. If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed, so this operator is optional, but MAY be included.\n```\n\nI would like to offer two suggestions:\n\nExplain in the guessing game how we told Cargo we wanted a `0.3.x` version, currently this is just a statement (`So, we told Cargo we wanted ...`) without explanation.\n\nMake it more clear how cargo and npm differ with regards to semver, especially considering npm is linked to directly in the documentation.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/26482/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/26482/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
