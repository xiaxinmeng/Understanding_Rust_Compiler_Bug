Somehow it only uses `msvc`, as the default.\r\nAs a workaround I have to do `rustc +nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu file.rs` and that works, but the short variant should work too. It should look for both the `msvc` variant and the `gnu` variant.\r\n\r\nIt could be that `rustup run nightly rustc file.rs`, `cargo +nightly run` and others have the same issue.", "closed_by": {"login": "r00ster91", "id": 35064754, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDY0NzU0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35064754?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91", "html_url": "https://github.com/r00ster91", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90194/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90194/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
