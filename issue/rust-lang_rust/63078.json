However, I do still think both the containing method's return type _and_ the `reqwest::get` call should be highlighted for the best experience and to easily allow a full understanding of what's happening.", "closed_by": {"login": "estebank", "id": 1606434, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY0MzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1606434?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank", "html_url": "https://github.com/estebank", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63078/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63078/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
