"active_lock_reason": null, "body": "This is a tracking issue for the RFC \"Clarify and streamline paths and visibility\" (rust-lang/rfcs#2126).\r\n\r\n**Steps:**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement the RFC. The various implementation steps are broken out into subissues (or will be, in some cases).\r\n    - [x] permit `foo.rs` or `foo/mod.rs` to support submodules like `foo/bar.rs` #45385 \r\n        - ([mentoring instructions here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/45385#issuecomment-337950379))\r\n    - [x] introduce `crate` as a visibility modifier #45388\r\n        - ([mentoring instructions here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/45388))\r\n    - [x] allow `crate` to begin an absolute path https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/45477\r\n    - [x] add a lint for `pub` items that are not visible from crate root https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/45521\r\n- [ ] Some implementation issues are blocked on permitting `crate` to begin an absolute path. Neither of these items would take effect unless we are using that extension:\r\n    - [x] add a lint for absolute paths that do not begin with `crate` (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48722)\r\n    - [ ] allow eliding `extern crate` when feature gate is given\r\n        - Rationale for delaying: if we require all local paths to begin with crate, we don't need to worry about fallback\r\n        - This feature also depends on [Allowing renaming of crates in the dependencies section](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1311)\r\n        - [x] Add epoch lint for this https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48719\r\n- [ ] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on forge][doc-guide])\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on forge][stabilization-guide])\r\n\r\n[stabilization-guide]: https://forge.rust-lang.org/stabilization-guide.html\r\n[doc-guide]: https://forge.rust-lang.org/stabilization-guide.html#updating-documentation\r\n\r\n**Unresolved questions:**\r\n\r\n- How should we approach migration? Via a fallback, as proposed, or via epochs? It is probably best to make this determination with more experience, e.g. after we have a `rustfix` tool in hand.\r\n\r\n- The final syntax for absolute paths; there's more bikeshedding to be done here in a context where we can actually try out the various options. In particular, there are some real advantages to having *both* `crate::` and `extern::` paths, but ideally we could do it in a more succinct way.\r\n    - Currently, we accept `::crate::foo` only. However, we also parse `struct Foo(crate ::foo)` as an illegal path, rather than treating `crate` as a visibility modifier.
