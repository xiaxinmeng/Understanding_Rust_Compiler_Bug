A few people said they liked it, but I feel that most of the feedback was slightly negative. In the ten days since then, I believe I have in IRC heard one positive opinion and on quite a few occasions (at least half a dozen, which I would consider quite a large number) distinctly negative opinions, some of things that at the time we thought that we could live with but are discovering that, having given it time to sink in, it really _is_ worse. At first glance, the changes may _look_ nicer (I don\u2019t know\u2014I didn\u2019t find it so, overall), but we have lost a _lot_ of utility and character in it.\n\nI want us to change our direction and mostly go back to the old styles.\n\nHere are my three main reasons for saying, \u201cThe old is good\u201d:\n- Things were separated into blocks that could be perceived individually, much more effectively. In some places this went a little too far, and I would be in favour of changing the main content\u2019s background from grey to a very light grey, but taking out _all_ blocks is significant hindrance to usability. The structure of all the content is very significantly important; being able to quickly navigate around.\n- The old design had character. The bottom borders on things, the distinct colour scheme, the fonts\u2014they all _felt like Rust_. I draw particular attention to the blocky font used in the headings; that font was a very good font choice and fits in with the Rust name, logo (_especially_ the logo), &c. More changes to the new styles are being proposed, but the changes are still just feeling tacky and generic\u2014they don\u2019t feel like _Rust_.\n  \n  Character is a surprisingly important thing, and at present we\u2019ve lost it. I think we should be looking rather at changing the styles of the non-rustdoc docs to make them _feel like Rust_. I hope you understand the abstract concept that I am getting at.\n- Not only did the font choices have character, they were also easier to read the structure of the page from. This has also contributed to it being more difficult to read things.\n\nThis is mostly separate from issues like the reduction of information density (#13591)\u2014that can be improved upon without going back to the old layout, though I rather suspect that with the everywhere\u2010is\u2010white approach, usability will be hindered further by more dense information. But I cannot reasonably hold that as a point against the new design until it has been tried.\n\nI propose, then, that we revert almost all of the style changes. I would still keep the lightening of the grey background in the main body area (_not_ in the sidebar by any means), though I would prefer it not to be taken quite to white\u2014rather, swap its background colour with that of the code blocks, as they were back then. Not lessening anyone\u2019s contributions to either design in any way, I believe that the earlier design was largely more appropriate for Rust.\n\nNo decision should be reached terribly rapidly on this matter; it would be well to try to gauge what people _actually_ feel about the matter; it may be that, given the threat to the new design, people will flock to support it and it be revealed that I am actually incorrect. It is always hard to judge such things. Most people will always be silent.\n\n/cc @TheHydroImpulse @adrientetar @brson @huonw @cmr @Seldaek\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13780/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13780/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
