If you'd like to help out, comment with the bunch of errors you'd like to tackle, and list yourself as assigned on the spreadsheet!\n\nChoosing a few errors in the same file is probably a good way to start.\n# How to add an error explanation\n\nError explanations live in `src/librustc*/diagnostics.rs`. To add a new explanation you have to delete the error from the `register_diagnostics!` invocation and add it to the `register_long_diagnostics!` invocation, along with the explanation. The format for the explanation is 80 characters per line, with a newline at the very start and end of the string. Including code examples is encouraged, with full markdown formatting (single-tick for inline, triple for blocks). Copy the format of the existing errors and you should be good!\n\nOnce you've added an explanation you can test it out by compiling and running stage1 as follows:\n\n``` shell\n$ make rustc-stage1\n$ export PATH=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage1/bin:$PATH\n$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage1/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n$ rustc --explain EXXXX\n```\n\nIf you want to see how it renders as HTML you'll have to build the error index, which requires stage2:\n\n``` shell\n$ make doc/error-index.html\n```\n\nYou can add `-j 4` to use 4 parallel `make` processes.\n\nOnce you're happy with the result, submit a pull request and we'll review it.\n# Progress\n\nWe're tracking progress with a shared spreadsheet. If you'd like to write an error message, put your name down for one of the unassigned errors.\n\n[Rust Error Diagnostic Spreadsheet (click me!)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qt8Bs6qp4NLP2FYQ361CZ4U-3OsUWNCLQX3c_jGtvqM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAs you complete error descriptions it would also be great if you could mark the errors as \"merged\" on the spreadsheet :smile:\n", "closed_by": {"login": "GuillaumeGomez", "id": 3050060, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTAwNjA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3050060?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez", "html_url": "https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24407/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24407/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
