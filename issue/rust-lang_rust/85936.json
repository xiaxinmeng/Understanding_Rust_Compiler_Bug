The following successfully compiles:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn f() -> ! {\r\n    loop {}\r\n    ();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following without the semicolon does not:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn f() -> ! {\r\n    loop {}\r\n    ()  // ERROR: expected ! found unit type\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected to see this happen:\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that the type of a block expression without a final expression is `()`, so I would expect these to both be the same \u2014 probably both should error, since I would expect both have the type `()` as the final expression.  If not, can someone explain how the types resolve here?\r\n\r\nNote: This was changed in #45880 (I think) where before that both were accepted.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\nrustc 1.54.0-nightly (ff2c947c0 2021-05-25)", "closed_by": {"login": "ehuss", "id": 43198, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTk4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43198?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss", "html_url": "https://github.com/ehuss", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85936/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85936/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
