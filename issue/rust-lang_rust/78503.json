For\r\nexample, `rustc_middle::ich` would become `rustc_ich` or something (I'm working\r\non this right now).\r\n\r\nHowever, a lot of the `rustc_middle` modules *already have* crates named after\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n`rustc_middle` module | similarly-named crate\r\n----------------------|----------------------\r\n`rustc_middle::arena` | `rustc_arena`\r\n`rustc_middle:hir` | `rustc_hir`\r\n`rustc_middle::infer` | `rustc_infer`\r\n`rustc_middle::lint` | `rustc_lint`\r\n`rustc_middle::macros` | `rustc_macros`\r\n`rustc_middle::mir` | `rustc_mir`\r\n`rustc_middle::query` | `rustc_query_system`\r\n`rustc_middle::traits` | `rustc_traits`\r\n`rustc_middle::ty` | `rustc_ty`\r\n\r\nI believe for the case of `rustc_middle::mir` -> `rustc_mir` the difference is\r\nthat `rustc_middle::mir` contains the definition for the MIR and associated code\r\nlike the MIR visitors, while `rustc_mir` contains analysis code (e.g. borrowck),\r\nbut I don't know what the differences are for the others. Therefore, my goal\r\nwith this meta issue is to collect information about what the differences\r\nare to make it easier to split up `rustc_middle`.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/78503/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/78503/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
