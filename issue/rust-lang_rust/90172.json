In that\r\ncase, you can use use `issue = \"none\"` in your initial implementation PR. The\r\nreviewer will ask you to open a tracking issue if they agree your feature can be\r\nadded without an RFC.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFeature gate: `#![feature(error_reporter)]`\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for a `Report` type that wraps an error, allowing the entire error chain to be printed in either single- or multi-line format. \r\n\r\nImplementation PR: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/91938\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a short description of the feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor most library features, it'd be useful to include a summarized version of the public API.\r\n(E.g. just the public function signatures without their doc comments or implementation.)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub struct Report<E = Box<dyn Error>> {\r\n    error: E,\r\n    show_backtrace: bool,\r\n    pretty: bool,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl<E> Report<E>\r\nwhere\r\n    Report<E>: From<E>,\r\n{\r\n    pub fn new(error: E) -> Report<E>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl<E> Report<E> {\r\n    pub fn pretty(mut self, pretty: bool) -> Self;\r\n    pub fn show_backtrace(mut self, show_backtrace: bool) -> Self;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl<E> From<E> for Report<E>\r\nwhere\r\n    E: Error;\r\n\r\nimpl<'a, E> From<E> for Report<Box<dyn Error + 'a>>\r\nwhere\r\n    E: Error + 'a;\r\n\r\nimpl<E> fmt::Display for Report<E>\r\nwhere\r\n    E: Error;\r\n\r\nimpl fmt::Display for Report<Box<dyn Error>>;\r\n\r\nimpl<E> fmt::Debug for Report<E>\r\nwhere\r\n    Report<E>: fmt::Display;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOnce the feature has gone through a few release cycles and there are no\r\nunresolved questions left, the feature might be ready for stabilization.\r\n\r\nIf this feature didn't go through the RFC process, a final comment period\r\n(FCP) is always needed before stabilization. This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library API team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncomment period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- There exists an `impl<E> From<E> for Report<E> where E: Error` that converts an error into a report. Is it possible to make this work for types that convert into the inner error type?\r\n\r\nEdit(yaahc):\r\n\r\n- `show_backtrace` currently has no effect if the `pretty` format isn't enabled, we won't display backtraces ever in the single line format. I dislike this aspect, and am wondering if setting `show_backtrace` should implicitly also enable `pretty`, which isn't necessarily much better, but at least it's less error prone.\r\n- I don't like the name of `pretty`, in the docs we refer to it as the multi-line format, should it just be `multiline`?\r\n- I dislike how requiring the boolean for `pretty`/`show_backtrace` means you can't write something like `let val = my_result.map_err(Report::new).map_err(Report::pretty).unwrap();`, though I'm leaning towards this being the lesser evil compared to the issues with lifetimes and if statements on alternative builder API styles. It's not that big of a deal to introduce a closure like `.map_err(|r| r.pretty(should_be_pretty))`", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90172/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90172/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
