Apple's clang/LLVM generally includes stability enhancements that would otherwise potentially cause problems for developers. I'm not sure what the benefits are of using Rust's current LLVM, e.g. it can be newer than Apple's, but Apple's clang is a really safe bet and seems a good thing to use by default. Some of these platform-specific issues can manifest in weird and very difficult to diagnose ways, e.g. random restarts, that it would be good to save developers from.\r\n\r\nWe could just give users a bitcode file for them to compile with clang themselves (#35968), or maybe there's some way to have the user specify which version of clang they want.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48833/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48833/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
