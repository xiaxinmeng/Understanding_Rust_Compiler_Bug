On the other hand, the rules regarding `Deref` and `DerefMut` were designed specifically to accommodate smart pointers. Because of this, **`Deref` should only be implemented for smart pointers** to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nThis warning has sparked significant confusion, which seems to stem from there being no consensus of what *actually is* a \"smart pointer\".
