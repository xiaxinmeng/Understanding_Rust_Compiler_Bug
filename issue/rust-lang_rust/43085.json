They disable LLVM assertions, significantly improving compile times compared to Nightly. More background: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/disabling-llvm-assertions-in-nightly-builds/5388\r\n\r\nServo uses these by default when available. Them being only available for a small number of platforms is ok because that covers platforms most developers use, and we can fall back to \"normal\" slower Nightly compilers.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/42967 we ran into an issue that only occurred on OS X, when compiling crates that depend on procedural macro crates, when using an \"alt\" compiler with a \"non-alt\" standard library. It seems in theory that enabling or disabling LLVM assertions in rustc should not have any effect on standard libraries, but we worked around that issue in https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/17575 by making sure we download an std of the same kind as rustc.\r\n\r\nIt gets tricky when cross-compiling (for example to Android), since \"alt\" standard libraries are not necessarily available for the target platform even when they are for the host. In https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/17604 we might need to rewrite our `mach` configuration handling and Rust bootstrapping to be able to support selecting an \"alt\" vs \"non-alt\" compiler depending on the cross-compilation target.\r\n\r\nBut do we really need to? Or is https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/42967 a rustc bug after all? \"Should\" it work to use an \"alt\" rustc with \"non-alt\" std?\r\n\r\nCC @aturon since I don\u2019t know are the appropriate people to ask, please redirect.", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43085/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43085/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
