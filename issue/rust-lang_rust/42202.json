At the very least, bindgen (and its dependency syntex) need this to exist so they have a reasonable chance of representing C++ instance methods in an AST.  `thiscall` is therefore important for the interop story between Rust and C++ on Windows.\r\n\r\nI don't *think* you could actually write callable C++ instance methods in Rust for MSVC, since mangled names in MSVC contain characters that, AFAICT, are not legal in Rust identifiers ('?', for instance).
