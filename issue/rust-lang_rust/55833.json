The file structure of my project is like so:\r\n\r\n- src\r\n  - assets\r\n    - style.css\r\n  - views\r\n    - view1.rs\r\n    - view2.rs\r\n    - ...\r\n  - main.rs\r\n\r\nThe project itself is built in two ways: Locally, on my Windows 10 machine, and via CI to cross-compile it for a Raspberry Pi (running Raspbian, using target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf). After updating, it seems like `include_str!`'s file path resolution logic doesn't match across the targets, seeing as my project was successfully building on both targets yesterday. To be more clear, after updating, this code:\r\n\r\n`include_str!(\"assets/style.css\")`\r\n\r\nwhich is called from within any of the viewx.rs files, will output the following on Windows:\r\n\r\n`couldn't read src\\views\\assets/style.css: The system cannot find the path specified. (os error 3)`\r\n\r\nbut will compile just fine for the Pi. Changing the path to `../assets/style.css` will allow it to compile on Windows, but will break the Pi's build, with an error of:\r\n\r\n`error: couldn't read src/../assets/style.css: No such file or directory (os error 2)`\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what `include_str!` is looking for in terms of path now, as previously 'assets/style.css' correctly pointed to the file on both targets (and by previously I mean likely Rust 1.29 - I also switched from nightly to stable but the error persists on both). [The docs for `include_str!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_str.html) say that the path should be relative to the 'current file'. It seems that on Windows, the 'current file' is the file that's calling `include_str!` (i.e. view1.rs), whereas on the Pi/Linux, it's main.rs itself.", "closed_by": {"login": "kevinpoitra", "id": 18280134, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjgwMTM0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18280134?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kevinpoitra", "html_url": "https://github.com/kevinpoitra", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kevinpoitra/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kevinpoitra/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kevinpoitra/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kevinpoitra/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kevinpoitra/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kevinpoitra/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kevinpoitra/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kevinpoitra/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kevinpoitra/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55833/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55833/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
