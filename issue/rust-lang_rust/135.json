That is:\n\n```\nlet foo farm = arm(5);\nalt (farm) {\n    case (arm(x)) {\n        /* x is a local slot holding 5 here, assigning to\n           it does not change the value in farm */\n        x = 6;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis is possibly counterintuitive.  Maybe `x` should be an alias (caveat emptor: may require extra care).  In any case, we probably want to support some kind of way of writing to these fields, if we are going to allow them to be marked `mutable`.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "msullivan", "id": 340349, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDM0OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340349?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan", "html_url": "https://github.com/msullivan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/135/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/135/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
