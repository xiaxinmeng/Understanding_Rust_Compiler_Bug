To avoid overspecifying details, this involves sorting the points using a given comparison function; I know that this can only succeed if the points form a convex polygon, and so if the list is sorted afterward then I know that it is also convex.\r\n\r\nHowever, in order to ensure that this works, the sorting function *must* terminate in a reasonable amount of time regardless of whether the list is sorted or not. This happens for most efficient algorithms but not all of them, as most of them explicitly bound the number of iterations. It seems unlikely that the standard library would deviate from timsort or introsort any time soon, but in case it does, this would be a reasonable constraint to specify. It would be reasonable, I think, to guarantee that both of these algorithms are at worst O(n log n) time complexity regardless of the input slice *or* the comparison function. That is, the order is unspecified if the ordering is not well-ordered, but the time complexity does not change.\r\n\r\n(I should clarify, the standard library does satisfy this criteria; this is just a request to explicitly guarantee it.)", "closed_by": {"login": "clarfonthey", "id": 15850505, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODUwNTA1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15850505?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey", "html_url": "https://github.com/clarfonthey", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82134/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82134/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
