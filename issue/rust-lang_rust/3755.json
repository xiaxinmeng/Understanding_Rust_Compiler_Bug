I can imagine two ways to do this:\n1. I changed the kind checker to suggest adding a move in some cases where a noncopyable value gets copied. However, it may suggest it in a situation where a move would be illegal, which is kind of rude. The kind checker could use last-use results to provide a more accurate error message.\n2. There may be situations now where there are copies that could instead be moves (because they're actually last-uses, but copying is legal). A lint pass based on last-use results could warn about these. I don't know if it's possible for such a situation to arise, though (maybe these are all \"noncopyable\" errors or \"non-implicitly-copyable\" warnings now, I'm not sure).\n\nOf course, if we end up doing @nikomatsakis 's \"move or copy based on type\" idea, both of these points will be moot. \n\nThis was part of #2633, but I wanted to close #2633.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "catamorphism", "id": 427212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzIxMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/427212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism", "html_url": "https://github.com/catamorphism", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3755/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3755/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
