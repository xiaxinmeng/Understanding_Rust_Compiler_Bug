Some time ago, we added a `--llvm-root` option to configure (#1123), to allow the user to point the build at an LLVM outside the build tree.\n\nSome recent discussion on #4259 and on [wiki packaging](../wiki/Note-packaging) leads me to conclude that the `llvm-root` switch is broken.\n\nWe may want to fix it, e.g. to test, once our patches have landed upstream, whether a new version of LLVM works.\n\n(Also, I would be curious if there is a way to build the LLVM source once and share it amongst multiple clones of the Rust git repository.  Doing that was the impetus for my interest in this matter, though in hindsight it is possible that `--llvm-root` never actually supported that use-case.)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6802/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6802/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
