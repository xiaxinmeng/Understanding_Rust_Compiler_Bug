One, the implicit-ref thing is a big pain in our semantics, causes lots of \"illegal borrow unless pure\" errors to confuse newbies, and once implicit-ref argument modes go away, it will be the last thing of its kind. Two, moving out of multi-branch enums is impossible. I'm sure there are more.\n\nNew rules should be:\n- both 'let' and 'match' match by-copy or by-move (which one is inferred) by default.\n- moving out of enums (any patterns, really) is allowed if the matched-on expression is an rvalue or a last-use.\n- moving out of certain patterns (I think just '@') should never be allowed.\n- 'let' patterns must be irrefutable.\n- if you're not moving out (deconstructing), you can use 'ref' in bindings to create an explicit region pointer.\n\nAs a transitionary step, we are adding 'move' and 'copy' keywords that are to be used the same way as 'ref' in patterns. Once match's bind-by-implicit-ref goes away, 'copy' can become the default. Once there's a way to infer which of 'move' or 'copy' is meant, 'move' can go away too.\n\nHere are some bugs:\n#3224 - Patterning on `~` pointers. Moving out should be sometimes allowed.\n#3024 - Patterning on `@` pointers. Moving out should never be allowed.\n#3235, ~~#3256~~ - 'ref' working properly\n#3097, moves into patterns always copy\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pcwalton", "id": 157897, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton", "html_url": "https://github.com/pcwalton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3271/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3271/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
