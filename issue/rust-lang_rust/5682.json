Rustpkg should [follow a similar strategy to Go here](http://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable), wherein there's an environment variable -- say `$RUST_PATH` -- that is a colon (or semi on windows) separated list of \"directories in which to resolve pkgids\", and the first existing entry in the search path is the directory in which _new_ packages are fetched and installed by default. Target libs need to be put in an arch-specific subdir.\n\nAt the end of the `$RUST_PATH` search (and therefore also the default if users don't _define_ a `$RUST_PATH`) we should also include some implicit search entries:\n- Any existing dir named `.rust` in `$CWD` and every parent of `$CWD` up to the filesystem root\n- A dir named `.rust` in the user's homedir, if it exists\n\nThe rustc driver should also understand how to search these paths for libraries.\n\nNote that while it is _desirable_ for rustpkg to be \"purely functional\" and thereby automatically segregate separate builds of the same artifact by storing built artifacts under different version-prefixed or input-hash-prefixed directories, in practice there will always be cases of missing or uncaptured dependencies (environment-sensitivity is very hard to rule out) and providing \"different builds in different locations under the user's control\" is a necessary mechanism for working around these cases.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "catamorphism", "id": 427212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzIxMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/427212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism", "html_url": "https://github.com/catamorphism", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/5682/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/5682/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
