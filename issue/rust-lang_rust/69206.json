This meant we could write tests against them just like they were a library. And the issue went away. People didn't feel forced to restructure their code.\r\n\r\nFor a real life example, there's lots of functionality in diesel cli that we'd like to call programmatically but as it's a bin we can't. We'd have to refactor a lot of that functionality into a lib and then have the bin call that.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I warn people off doing `cargo new hello_world` and suggest they do `cargo new --lib hello_world` and add a `src/bin/hello_world.rs` because there's almost no point starting with a bin.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's a little controversial raising this as a bug, but I've come to the conclusion that it is a bug not a feature. .Net saw it as a usability limitation and they fixed it. If it's technically possible to fix, I think this would provide a smoother experience and remove arbitrary distinctions that don't need to be there.", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69206/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69206/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
