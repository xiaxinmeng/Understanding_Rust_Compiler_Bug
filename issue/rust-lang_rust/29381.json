In general, these docs could use some headers for each bit, rather than the rambly style they're in now.\r\n- [ ] [`assert_eq`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.assert_eq.html) could use links to `assert!`, also dropping the `()`. same deal with \"versions\" too. Mentioning its relationship to `PartialEq` would be nice.\r\n- [ ] [`assert_ne`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.assert_ne.html) has the same issues as `assert_eq!`.\r\n- [ ] [`column`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.column.html) needs to drop the `()`s, and doesn't explain why you might care about the column that it was invoked in. \r\n- [ ] [`debug_assert`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.debug_assert.html) needs a bunch of links, and should really end up mostly pointing to the docs of `assert`.\r\n- [ ] [`debug_assert_eq`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.debug_assert_eq.html) same as `debug_assert`, that is, should mostly point to `assert_eq`.\r\n- [ ] [`debug_assert_ne`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.debug_assert_ne.html), same as the two previous. \r\n- [ ] [`file!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.file.html) same as `column!`\r\n- [ ] [`format!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.format.html) this macro is very useful and has very little docs, what a shame! It should have a lot more, at least pointing out that it's a common way to concatenate a lot of strings, for example.\r\n- [ ] [`format_args`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.format_args.html) could use a lot of work, mostly expanding on what it is and why it's there.\r\n- [ ] [`include`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include.html) this macro explains why it's bad but then doesn't show an example. It should.\r\n- [ ] [`line!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.line.html) similar to `column!`\r\n- [ ] [`option_env!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.option_env.html) needs links to `Option<T>`\r\n- [ ] [`panic!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic.html) has anemic docs for something so heavily used!\r\n- [ ] [`print!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.print.html) could use a bunch of links\r\n- [ ] [`println!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.println.html) could use links\r\n- [ ] [`thread_local`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.thread_local.html) should link when it mentions `LocalKey`, not at the end.\r\n- [ ] [`try!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.try.html) should be a little more strongly worded about `?` and should show examples of their equivalence.\r\n- [ ] [`unreachable!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.unreachable.html) should discuss how it's different than the intrinsic.\r\n- [ ] [`vec!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.vec.html) could use a lot of links and some more text.\r\n- [x] [`write!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.write.html) has just... awkward docs. It's a weird macro, so that's why, but it could use re-done, IMHO.\r\n- [x] [`writeln`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.writeln.html) should mostly link to `write!` and point out that it's the same but with the extra newline.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29381/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29381/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
