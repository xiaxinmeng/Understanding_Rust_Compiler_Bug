I found that this does not happen if the two files are hard linked. I think the sameness check (_are src and dest the same file?_) may have a false positive in this case. I guess the problem is that it's not always trivial to check whether two paths refer to the same file, but comparing inodes for equality doesn't give the right answer.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple program that should link \"a.txt\" to \"b.txt\", overwriting if necessary:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\r\n    std::fs::hard_link(\"a.txt\", \"temp_file\")?;\r\n    std::fs::rename(\"temp_file\", \"b.txt\")?;\r\n    Ok(())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first time it runs, it operates as expected, with `temp_file` no longer existing because it has been renamed:\r\n```shell\r\n$ touch a.txt b.txt\r\n$ cargo run --quiet && ls\r\na.txt  b.txt  Cargo.lock  Cargo.toml  src  target\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second time it runs, `temp_file` is not deleted as part of the rename operation:\r\n```shell\r\n$ cargo run --quiet && ls\r\na.txt  b.txt  Cargo.lock  Cargo.toml  src  target  temp_file\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe source argument should be deleted when a rename is successful. Because although the semantics of this case are weird, a user should always be able to assume that if `fs::rename` is successful (and if there is no race condition), the source path no longer exists, and the destination path contains the file that used to be at the source path.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.57.0-nightly (2c7bc5e33 2021-09-15)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 2c7bc5e33c25e29058cbafefe680da8d5e9220e9\r\ncommit-date: 2021-09-15\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.57.0-nightly\r\nLLVM version: 13.0.0\r\n```\r\nThe issue also occurs on stable 1.55.0.\r\n\r\nNote: the environment is Linux (WSL2).
