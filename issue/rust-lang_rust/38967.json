Is it possible to select one impl or the other?\r\n\r\nWhen discussing this in #rust, @mbrubeck also found that [impls on trait objects don't check for overlap at all](https://is.gd/vOQKcS):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait C<T> {}\r\n\r\nimpl<T> C<T> { fn asdf(&self) {} }\r\nimpl<T> C<T> { fn asdf(&self) {} }\r\n\r\nstruct W {}\r\nimpl<T> C<T> for W {}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let b = Box::new(W {}) as Box<C<()>>;\r\n    b.asdf();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn both of these examples, taking out the call to `asdf()` makes the sample compile, meaning that it's only upon method resolution that this conflict is found. The former can be ruled out as a coherence issue, and the latter is directly an overlapping impl, that wouldn't be allowed on a regular struct/enum.\r\n\r\ncc #36889, per talchas in #rust", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38967/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38967/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
