Also when do you chose between `//~` and `//~^`, is that only for placing the comment and are these the same:\n\n```\nfoo //~ HELP whatever\n```\n\n```\nfoo\n//~^ HELP whatever\n```\n\nOr is there more going on?\n\nIt'd also be quite nice to have a one line summary of the different test types, clarifying how `compile-fail-fulldeps` is different from `compile-fail`, etc.  I know I can figure it out given long enough, but it'd save a lot of time.
