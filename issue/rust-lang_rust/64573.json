We implemented an automated approach, named CARTESIAN, for prioritizing Pull Requests (PRs) received by an open-source project according to the likelihood of acceptance/response. We would like to evaluate whether CARTESIAN can help integrators when reviewing PRs. \r\nAs we noticed that your project receives many PRs daily, we have taken the liberty of contacting you. Thus, we experimented CARTESIAN on Your projects, to help you in prioritizing PRs. To know more about these results, please fill in the form below. \r\nSurvey form link: https://forms.gle/y2SNzXpV5BXEMrSq7    \r\nYour participation is voluntary and confidential. We kindly request you, ONLY to INTEGRATORS, to participate in this study which is expected to take about 15 minutes of your time. You might withdraw at any time.\r\nBest regards,\r\nMuhammad Ilyas Azeem, National Engineering Research Center of Fundamental Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China\r\nAndrea Di Sorbo, University of Sannio, Italy\r\nSebastiano Panichella, Zurich University of Applied Science, Switzerland\r\nAlexander Serebrenik, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "jonas-schievink", "id": 1786438, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY0Mzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786438?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonas-schievink", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/64573/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/64573/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
