This could cut down on `ignore`/`no_run` code blocks as well as hidden lines at the same time.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n    Here is an example of using mutable variables. First, let's make some bindings.\r\n    \r\n    ```rust\r\n    let a = 1;\r\n    let mut b = 2;\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    `a` can't be modified, but `b` can!\r\n    \r\n    ```rust,cont\r\n    // a += 1; // this would be an error!\r\n    b += 1;\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nClicking the run button on either code block would open a playpen with all the code. Syntax up for debate.\r\n\r\ncc @QuietMisdreavus", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45726/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 2, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45726/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
