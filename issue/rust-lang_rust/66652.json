I think it's because many irrelevant (to me) stack frames are shown -- I'm getting 11 frames at the top relating to panicking and backtrace printing, and at the bottom there are 8 relating to panic catching and other initialization.  The frames I really want to look at are somewhere in the middle, but I have trouble scanning the output to find them.\r\n\r\nTwo potential ideas for improving the readability:\r\n\r\n1. Omit the panic / backtrace / initialization frames by default, and only show them when `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` is used.\r\n2. Color code the output so that the panic / backtrace / initialization frames are de-emphasized.", "closed_by": {"login": "jonas-schievink", "id": 1786438, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY0Mzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786438?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonas-schievink", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66652/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66652/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
