I can pass-around instances of Baz and call the function.\nNow if I wan Baz to be copy-able, which should be possible since it only contains a pointer, and add the `#[deriving(Clone)]` attribute to it, I got a strange compiler error:\n\n```\nerror: mismatched types: expected `fn(&int)` but found `fn(&int)` (expected concrete lifetime, but found bound lifetime parameter &)\ntest.rs:4 #[deriving(Clone)]\n```\n\nThis worked perfectly well (including the deriving(Clone) attribute) while the function only took parameters by owned boxes or by-value. I only get this message since I added a borrowed parameter to the function. I don't see the problem here. If a function is simply passed by-pointer we should be able to copy this pointer.\n\nI'm not sure this is the right title for this issue. Feel free to change it if it's miss chosen.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10501/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10501/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
