I just filed https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust/issues/637 to document what and why we need to be able to link mixed C++/Rust binaries with `rustc` as the linker driver. I believe what you propose will solve all our problems, but just to be sure I'd like to reiterate:\r\n\r\n* we'd like to control bundling (whether or not a library is wrapped in `--whole-archive`/`--no-whole-archive`\r\n* we'd like to be able to pass `--start-lib`/`--end-lib` with object files instead of a static archive. I believe we will be able to do that using `--codegen=link-arg` after the proposed change to keep relative order of `-l:` flags and `--codegen=link-arg` respected\r\n* we'd like to pass libraries verbatim\r\n\r\nMy questions:\r\n\r\n1) Do all 3 points make sense to you and do you agree that `native_link_modifiers` aim to solve them?\r\n2) Do you have a timeline in which this could be implemented? Do you seek contributions for this effort?\r\n\r\nThank you!", "closed_by": {"login": "petrochenkov", "id": 5751617, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTE2MTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5751617?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov", "html_url": "https://github.com/petrochenkov", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/83282/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/83282/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
