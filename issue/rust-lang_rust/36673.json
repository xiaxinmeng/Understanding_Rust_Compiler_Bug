I'm on nightly, since my project uses type macros. Overall, there is a good amount of macro expansion going on, since I build parsers for binary data based on structs.\n\nCompilation time for a 5500 LOC project has been around 7-9 seconds on my Core i7-4770, going a bit up and down with changes in the project, and changes in nightly.\n\nHowever, today this changed very drastically:\n\n[chrivers@helios]~/git/artemis/oxide #cargo build\n   Compiling oxide v0.1.0 (file:///home/chrivers/git/artemis/oxide)\n    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 21.94 secs\n\nThis is more than twice as slow as before! Something pretty significant must have happened.\n\nThis version is definitely affected:\n`rustc 1.13.0-nightly (4f9812a59 2016-09-21)`\n\nHonestly, I'm not quite sure when it worked, but I can say that the version I used yesterday, which was probably no more than 1 week old, worked much better.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36673/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36673/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
