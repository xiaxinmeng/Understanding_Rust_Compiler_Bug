We will always want a line-buffering stdout at most for prints to a terminal, but when stdout is piped elsewhere we would ideally like to buffer more than just one line.\n\nThe reasoning for changing this is that diagnosing a runaway rust process becomes _much_ more difficult with a buffered stdout. Most programmers are expecting some sort of line buffer, but very few consider flushing stdout after all of their lines have been printed as well. As a result, a program killed by a signal currently doesn't flush stdout, meaning that all of that output is lost. This output is likely very important for diagnosing why the process went awry in the first place.\n\nI would like to turn this buffering back on, but not until we have a good solution for this fairly common case.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10279/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10279/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
