It would be great if I could write:\n\n```\n#debug(\"%?\", tcx, t);\n```\n\nand not have to write out the call to `ty_to_str`. perhaps there could be an RTS hook to say \"for type `ty::t`, call `ty_to_str`? I guess this could potentially be very hard since at runtime, tys probably aren't distinguished from ints. Alternately, (though not quite as awesomely), there could be another format string specifier or something for types. Basically, I just want to be able to pretty-print a type in a `#fmt` call without writing out `ty_to_str`, because that's a lot of characters :-) (And slightly more seriously, then I have to import `ty_to_str`, which requires remembering what module it lives in...)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2366/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2366/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
