However this isn't strictly necessary for a couple reasons:\n1. Some calculations have overflow that is \"cancelled\" out by a later step, for example `a + 100 - 1000`. The `a + 100` step may overflow, but the following `- 1000` step will cancel it out producing the correct result.\n2. Overflowed calculations are only a problem if the produced value is observed. This actually came up in the compiler a couple times when overflow checking was first implemented as well as in one of the standard libraries, a value would overflow, but if it did, the value was never actual read from in that case anyway.\n\n[This Paper](http://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=9019) (free to download), describes the As-Infinitely-Ranged Integer Model (AIR), which aims to mitigate some of those issues without losing safety.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31770/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31770/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
