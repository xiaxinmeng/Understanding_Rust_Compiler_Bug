Has there been any discussion about moving the Location type out of the std::panic module, or even just re-exporting under a different name if it needs to stay there for backwards compatibility?\r\n\r\nI'm really looking forward to track_caller, but almost none of my use cases are panic related and panic is a pretty eye-catching word in code that causes me to do a double-take every time I encounter it. It seems like a superficial thing to discuss compared with all the implementation details, but I just wanted to provide my experience in case that aspect has been overlooked.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @ggriffiniii in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/47809#issuecomment-618955432_\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@anp's thoughts: I also have non-panicking uses in mind for `Location::caller` and have thought a couple of times about proposing an alias like `core::source::Location` or similar.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/72444/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/72444/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
