Generally, the only new language features added after this milestone must be backwards compatible, or to fix soundness holes, though we do expect to have some leeway to make small incompatible fixes that have low impact on existing code bases.\r\n\r\n* Library stability - We have a system of measuring and ensuring the stability of API's, and a significant portion of the standard library is declared stable. Stable API's will not change. Large portions of the standard library need to be stable for 1.0, including primitive types, vectors, strings, option, numerics, collections, some I/O and concurrency.\r\n\r\n* User experience - The system is polished and the presentation is complete and professional. New users have a clear path to using and learning the system. This encompasses the web site, documentation, installation, and tooling.\r\n", "creator": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 376, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2013-10-10T18:48:33Z", "updated_at": "2016-08-28T23:13:24Z", "due_on": "2015-05-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2015-05-21T20:59:13Z"}, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2013-04-08T15:12:07Z", "updated_at": "2014-07-01T18:49:21Z", "closed_at": "2014-06-28T20:06:38Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "We currently assume (at least in vtable.rs. though not in infer) that self types are contravariant.  This is not sound since the `Self` type can appear anywhere, including return types.\n\nFor example, this program compiles:\n\n```\ntrait Make {\n    fn make() -> Self;\n}\n\nimpl Make for *const uint {\n    fn make() -> *const uint {\n        ptr::null()\n    }\n}\n\nfn maker<M:Make>() -> M {\n    Make::make()\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let a: *uint = maker::<*uint>();\n}\n```\n\nNote that we have \"produced\" a `*uint` even though there is no function in this program that returns one.  In this case, it's harmless, but of course one can construct other more harmful examples (particularly if we add other forms of subtyping such as struct inheritance or [datasort refinements](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2012/08/24/datasort-refinements/)).\n\nThe fix is a straight-forward modification (search for FIXMEs) but it invalidates a number of existing impls based around `*const T` and I didn't feel like dealing with the fallout as part of the patch I'm working on.\n\nSee also #3598---effectively we need a way to infer/declare variance for the Self parameter as well.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pcwalton", "id": 157897, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton", "html_url": "https://github.com/pcwalton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/5781/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/5781/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
