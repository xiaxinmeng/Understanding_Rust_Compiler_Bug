Ideally our support would look something like this:\n- The compiler recognizes the \"standard method\" of specifying that OSX 10.6 is being targeted (not the current version). I believe that this is an environment variable?\n- The compiler will then generate an appropriate `#[cfg]` when this is set to allow the crate to know that it's targeting 10.6 (or whatever the relevant OSX target is)\n- The standard library is then compiled against 10.6 _always_\n- The macros in the standard library will then select the \"best implementation\" based on the context they're built into.\n\nThis will incur a perf hit for the standard library itself, but it would allow us to go back to \"one distribution works everywhere\" which is much nicer than \"go build a separate copy of Rust to work on 10.6\".\n\ncc @rillian \n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/26581/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/26581/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
