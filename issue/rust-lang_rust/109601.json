However, the lint `#![deny(missing_doc_code_examples)]` is suggested in the `stable` version of Rustdoc Book, too - but without any mention that it's a `nightly` feature. Is it likely to get stabilized soon (so Rustdoc Book could stay as is)?\r\n\r\nOtherwise, shouldn't we document that (and create an issue to remove such a note from the Rustdoc Book once the feature becomes `stable`)? If so, I'm happy to create an issue and a PR.\r\n\r\nOr, should this be pulled out of stable Rustdoc Book until the feature is stabilized? Is there any recommended/de-facto practice for this?\r\n(This issue is a follow up to #109592.)", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/109601/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/109601/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
