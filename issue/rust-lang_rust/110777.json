Nothing in the diagnostic pointed me to that, though, so I had to figure out why this struct was different.\n\n### Other cases\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110777/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110777/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
