I used to often profile a locally built compiler with `debuginfo-level = 1` using `perf record --call-graph=dwarf cargo +stage1 build`.

I'm not sure what would be helpful for debugging this. I can provide some demonstration of the flamegraphs I get out of `inferno` in a few days, but if anyone has specific data they'd like about the builds I'm producing, happy to provide that.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110116/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110116/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
