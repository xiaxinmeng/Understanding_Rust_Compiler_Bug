(It took us non-trivial time to discover #19034 and understand the problem).\r\n\r\n#19034 was rejected on the grounds that it was \"working as intended\".  I ask that this be revisited:\r\n\r\n* is it really intended to produce a hobbled `impl`?\r\n* even if yes, can't we have an issue requesting that this be improved?\r\n* if the derived `impl` is for some reason unimprovable, would it be possible to give better explanation in the error?\r\n\r\n(Meta: I feel kinda bad opening an issue that I know full well has been rejected once already.
