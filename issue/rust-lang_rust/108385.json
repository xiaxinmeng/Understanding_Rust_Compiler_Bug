However, I found a case where the proc-macro system will forcibly error just because Rust doesn't support it, and it doesn't involve any special delimiters.\r\nI am adding hexadecimal, binary, etc floating point support to my [awint](https://crates.io/crates/awint) crate and encountered this problem:\r\n```\r\nproc_macro_ex!(0x123.456_i256f128); // error: hexadecimal float literal is not supported\r\n```\r\nthis is frustrating because it works if I chose some other closely related convention like `0j123.456_i256f128`.\r\n\r\nI am titling this issue more generally because I want to make sure there are not other cases like it.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108385/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108385/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
