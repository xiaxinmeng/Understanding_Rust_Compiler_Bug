You can verify this by running `llc -O0 -fast-isel -fast-isel-abort`. We have the following issues:\n- [ ] FastISel does not support the `invoke` instruction. Proposed solution: Add this support to LLVM.\n- [ ] FastISel does not support the `switch` instruction. Proposed solution: Add this support to LLVM.\n- [ ] FastISel does not support comparisons on `i1`. Proposed solution: Add this support to LLVM.\n- [ ] FastISel does not support the `llvm.assume` intrinsic. Proposed solution: Ignore that intrinsic in LLVM.\n- [x] FastISel does not allow first-class aggregates to be used, but we use first-class aggregates when loading and storing slices (e.g. `store { i8*, i32 } %1, %2`). Proposed solution: Stop doing this in trans.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pnkfelix", "id": 173127, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173127?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix", "html_url": "https://github.com/pnkfelix", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/26600/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/26600/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
