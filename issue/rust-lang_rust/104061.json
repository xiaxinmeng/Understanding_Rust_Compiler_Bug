In that\r\ncase, you can use use `issue = \"none\"` in your initial implementation PR. The\r\nreviewer will ask you to open a tracking issue if they agree your feature can be\r\nadded without an RFC.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFeature gate: `#![feature(const_hash)]`\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for using the `Hash` `Hasher` and `BuildHasher` traits in const Context.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a short description of the feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor most library features, it'd be useful to include a summarized version of the public API.\r\n(E.g. just the public function signatures without their doc comments or implementation.)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// std::collections::hash\r\nimpl DefaultHasher {\r\n    pub const fn new() -> DefaultHasher;\r\n}\r\nimpl const Hasher for DefaultHasher;\r\n\r\n// core::hash\r\n#[const_trait]\r\ntrait Hash;\r\n#[const_trait]\r\ntrait Hasher;\r\n#[const_trait]\r\ntrait BuildHasher;\r\n\r\nimpl const BuildHasher for BuildHasherDefault;\r\n\r\nimpl const Hash for bool;\r\nimpl const Hash for char;\r\nimpl const Hash for str;\r\nimpl const Hash for !;\r\n\r\nimpl<T: ~const Hash> const Hash for &T;\r\nimpl<T: ~const Hash> const Hash for &mut T;\r\nimpl<T: ~const Hash> const Hash for [T];\r\n\r\nimpl<A, B, ...> const Hash for (A, B, ...)\r\nwhere\r\n    A: ~const Hash,\r\n    B: ~const Hash, ...;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor larger features, more steps might be involved.\r\nIf the feature is changed later, please add those PRs here as well.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation: #104060\r\n- [ ] Final comment period (FCP)[^1]\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOnce the feature has gone through a few release cycles and there are no\r\nunresolved questions left, the feature might be ready for stabilization.\r\n\r\nIf this feature didn't go through the RFC process, a final comment period\r\n(FCP) is always needed before stabilization. This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library API team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncomment period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- None yet.\r\n\r\n[^1]: https://std-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/feature-lifecycle/stabilization.html\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/104061/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/104061/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
