Some things to remember:\r\n\r\n- Search for and replace references to `run-make-fulldeps`\r\n- Update path to `../../run-make-fulldeps/tools.mk` from just `../tools.mk`\r\n- `bootstrap` has an explicit reference to `fulldeps` in `test.rs` to build `RustDemangler` and set `--rust-demangler-path`, which should be changed to support the move to `run-make` without `fulldeps`\r\n\r\nI forgot about that last one and its possible that was the only issue.\r\n\r\nIf not, check `bootstrap` for other `fulldeps` dependencies, and note that the error I thought I saw had to do with `llvm-profdata` or `llvm-cov`. If so, those may require additional special handling in `bootstrap` or elsewhere.
