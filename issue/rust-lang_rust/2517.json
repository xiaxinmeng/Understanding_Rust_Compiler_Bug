For example, this code:\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let x = [(\"a\", \"b\")];\n    for x.each { |ab|\n        let (a, b) = ab;\n        #error(\"%? : %?\", a, b);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWarns with this message:\n\n```\ntest.rs:4:21: 4:23 warning: implicitly copying a non-implicitly-copyable value\ntest.rs:4         let (a, b) = ab;\n```\n\nTo fix it, we need to change the destructure to `let (a, b) = copy ab;`. The copy isn't needed for situations like this though. This code could be replaced with an alt-block to avoid the copy:\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let x = [(\"a\", \"b\")];\n    for x.each { |ab|\n        alt ab {\n          (a, b) { #error(\"%? : %?\", a, b) }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBut then that just adds more indention creep. Ideally rust would infer the usage and not require a copy, but if that's not possible,  nmatsakis mentioned we may be able to create region pointers when destructuring. He suggested a syntax like `let (&a, &b) = ab;`. This syntax could then also be used in alt-blocks to keep the destructuring syntax consistent.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pcwalton", "id": 157897, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton", "html_url": "https://github.com/pcwalton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2517/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2517/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
