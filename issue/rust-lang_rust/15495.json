It also seems strange to me that returning a struct field works, but returning a method which itself returns that struct field fails.\n\nAdmittedly, I don't really understand what `cannot move out of dereference of '&mut'-pointer` really means; a Google search doesn't yield very much, and the documentation doesn't seem to contain much regarding the error.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "huonw", "id": 1203825, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDM4MjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1203825?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw", "html_url": "https://github.com/huonw", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15495/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15495/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
