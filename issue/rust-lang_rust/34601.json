http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/\n- In the search box, type any keyword, such as `match`\n- Get back comprehensive documentation about `match`'s functionality, similar to the documentation for the primitive types (ex: [pointer](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.pointer.html))\n\nFor unused but reserved keywords, I would expect to see something along the lines of \"This keyword has no current functionality but is reserved for Rust to possibly use in the future.\"\n## Why this is important\n\nCurrently, all the details about pattern matching syntax is only documented in [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/patterns.html), as far as I can tell. In the new version of the book, [we're moving away from trying to be comprehensive towards just covering the most important, most commonly used constructs](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/issues/115). But if we remove documentation about, say, the precedence of `|` and match guards, where will people go to learn about it? ([The Reference doesn't have anything about that stuff either](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference.html#match-expressions)).\n\nFurthermore, how is a new rustacean supposed to know that, say, `i32` and `pointer` will return results but `match` and `where` will not?\n\nI'm going to research how the primitive types are documented, but wanted to file this for discussion purposes in the meantime.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34601/reactions", "total_count": 24, "+1": 24, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34601/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
