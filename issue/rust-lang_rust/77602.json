In addition to avoiding the overhead of compressing/decompressing, gaining the ability to `mmap` the crate metadata means that we may avoid loading unused portions from disk entirely. This is less important for proc-macros after https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76897, but might still have a noticable performance impact for dylibs.\r\n\r\nSuggested by @joshtriplett on Zulip.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77602/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77602/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
