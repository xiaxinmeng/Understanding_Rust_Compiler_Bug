In the borrow dataflow, however, when we apply statement effects, they take place on the **exit** from a location. The end result is that kills for borrows are applied slightly too late. Consider something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nL1: P = &X;\r\nL2: use(P); // last use\r\nL3: X = 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe region for P would be inferred to {L1, L2}. Therefore, the kill of L2 needs to include the borrow on line 1. However, what we actually do is to insert the kill after *L3*.\r\n\r\nI noticed this because I was trying to stop emitting `EndRegion` statements when using NLL. However, this caused false errors to be omitted.
