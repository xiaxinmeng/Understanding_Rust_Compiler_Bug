Although, it return an iterator over values of the map, its Debug implementation prints both keys and values because of the implementation detail. We should only print values for this struct.\r\n\r\nFor `BTreeMap`, we also have `ValuesMut`  struct for `BTreeMap::values_mut` method. We directly derive Debug for it. Which also means that Debug prints both keys and values. We should manually implement Debug instead and print only the values.\r\nIn addition to that, for BTreeMap, we also need to change IntoKeys and IntoValues structs. This is not an issue on HashMap because it was correctly implemented in the first place. But it wasn't for BTreeMap because we need an `IntoIter::iter` method for this first. So we should implement this and fix this issue for them as well.\r\n\r\nThis was discovered during #75163 and will be the follow-up of it.\r\n\r\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\r\n\r\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\r\n\r\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"canova\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\r\n\r\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\r\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75297/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75297/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
