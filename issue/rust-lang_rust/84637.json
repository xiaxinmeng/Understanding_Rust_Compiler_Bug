code](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=d2ca5441d3a7474ee44cde763a2dc8a4) that uses [the `std::str::trim_left` function that is marked `rustc_deprecated`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/4137088d9da94f693b287f35e2b17782c0b1a283/library/core/src/str/mod.rs#L1835-L1840):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let foo = str::trim_left(\"   aoeu\");\r\n    \r\n    let bar = \"   aoeu\".trim_left();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current output is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwarning: use of deprecated associated function `core::str::<impl str>::trim_left`: superseded by `trim_start`\r\n --> src/main.rs:2:15\r\n  |\r\n2 |     let foo = str::trim_left(\"   aoeu\");\r\n  |               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: replace the use of the deprecated associated function: `trim_start`\r\n  |\r\n  = note: `#[warn(deprecated)]` on by default\r\n\r\nwarning: use of deprecated associated function `core::str::<impl str>::trim_left`: superseded by `trim_start`\r\n --> src/main.rs:4:25\r\n  |\r\n4 |     let bar = \"   aoeu\".trim_left();\r\n  |                         ^^^^^^^^^ help: replace the use of the deprecated associated function: `trim_start`\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I run `cargo fix` on this example, I get this output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwarning: failed to automatically apply fixes suggested by rustc to crate `foo`\r\n\r\nafter fixes were automatically applied the compiler reported errors within these files:\r\n\r\n  * src/main.rs\r\n\r\nThis likely indicates a bug in either rustc or cargo itself,\r\nand we would appreciate a bug report! You're likely to see\r\na number of compiler warnings after this message which cargo\r\nattempted to fix but failed. If you could open an issue at\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues\r\nquoting the full output of this command we'd be very appreciative!\r\nNote that you may be able to make some more progress in the near-term\r\nfixing code with the `--broken-code` flag\r\n\r\nThe following errors were reported:\r\nerror[E0425]: cannot find function `trim_start` in this scope\r\n --> src/main.rs:2:16\r\n  |\r\n2 |     let _foo = trim_start(\"   aoeu\");\r\n  |                ^^^^^^^^^^ not found in this scope\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `suggestion` from the `rustc_deprecated` attribute applied correctly to the usage on line 4, but it replaced `str::trim_left` with just `trim_start` on line 2. I expected it to change this line to `let foo = str::trim_start(\"   aoeu\");`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the solution is to change the `^^^^^^` span marking to the leaf item that's deprecated. It *seems* like perhaps if the warning instead was:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2 |     let foo = str::trim_left(\"   aoeu\");\r\n  |                    ^^^^^^^^^ help: replace the use of the deprecated associated function: `trim_start`\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen perhaps only the `trim_left` in `str::trim_left` would be replaced by rustfix? If so, I'd like to try my hand at fixing this. I've read some `rustc_deprecated` related issues, however, and I'm getting a strong here-be-dragons vibe from them, so I wanted to check with someone more knowledgeable about if I'm on the right track before the yaks eat me.\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"hi-rustin\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84637/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 1, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84637/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
