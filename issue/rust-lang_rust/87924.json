You can find a reproduction script [here](https://github.com/davidpdrsn/axum-handle-error-slow-compile).\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if this is a known issue in rustc and if there is something I can do in axum to improve things (I'm the maintainer of axum). I don't have any experience debugging slow compile times so not sure how to approach this problem.\r\n\r\nFor context: [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) is a web framework that works by composing many [`tower::Service`s](https://docs.rs/tower/0.4.8/tower/trait.Service.html) (similarly to composing `Iterator` adaptors). This leads to large types with lots of generic type parameters. Compile times have been fine until now but for some reason `handle_error` in particular seems to slow things down.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n<!--\r\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\r\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.54.0 (a178d0322 2021-07-26)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: a178d0322ce20e33eac124758e837cbd80a6f633\r\ncommit-date: 2021-07-26\r\nhost: aarch64-apple-darwin\r\nrelease: 1.54.0\r\nLLVM version: 12.0.1\r\n```", "closed_by": {"login": "davidpdrsn", "id": 718941, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk0MQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/718941?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidpdrsn", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87924/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87924/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
