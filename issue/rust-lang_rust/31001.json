But I'm curious to know why the team chose to have two different type of `attributes`, and `comments` as well. \n\nOne is of the form `#[attr]`, while the other is `#![attr]`. \n\nThe former is straightforward, but the latter is for the item that its enclosing. \n\nTaking the example right out of the docs\n\n``` rust\n#[foo]\nstruct Foo;\n\nmod bar {\n    #![bar]\n}\n```\n\nIs there a necessity for this redundant complication? I see no reason why the same `#[foo]` can't be applied right outside the module. \n\ni.e, \n\n```\n#[foo]\nmod bar {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nNow, foo will apply into the scope. From what I can surmise, the only reason I can come up is, for scenarios like these:\n\n```\nlet x = |x| {\n #[foo for this block]\n}\n```\n\nBut this can also be quite easily achieved with the compiler, this way, \n\n```\nlet x =  #[foo] |x| {\n ...\n}\n```\n\nSimilar to how attributes are handled in C# for example. I see it from the perspective that a little more complication in the compiler to be able to resolve these would definitely be better than complicating the whole language by adding a language syntax that seems entirely redundant. And when it comes to readability, the one is actually quite better than a whole new syntax for achieving the same thing, because the intent is more consistent. \n\nSame goes for comments, for the module as well. Can't this just be simplified? Rust already has a complicated enough learning curve, and these seem completely unnecessary. I'm hoping that I completely missed something, and I'm wrong :)  .. or this is not the most stellar design choice that should be rectified as soon as possible while the rust ecosystem is still in its infancy.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31001/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31001/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
