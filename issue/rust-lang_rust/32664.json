[Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo)) can be fairly slow, so I would like to set up a distributed build system. I'm mainly thinking about using [distcc](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Distcc)/[icecc](https://github.com/icecc/icecream), where you can set up a toolchain package to use on the build slaves, but I don't know if Rust/Cargo could operate in such way. \nIs this technically possible?
