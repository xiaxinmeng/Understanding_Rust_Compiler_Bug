This number was *steadily* increasing though, I just had to kill it before my computer crashed. Killing the builds was also incredibly difficult, `ctrl+c`s do nothing, task manager crashes when it's opened and x'ing the window does nothing. The only semi-reliable way I found to kill the process was to kill every python process that was running, then `x.py` exited with still no output. On the `python x.py build -i --stage 1 src/libstd` command in particular, the spawning was so out of control that I had to restart my entire system in order to regain control.\r\n\r\nThis was the first build of rustc that I've done, so there were no prior or cached artifacts\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n\r\n#### Arch\r\n\r\nWindows 10 Pro version 1909, OS build 18363.836\r\nPython 3.7.3\r\nThe results were the same in both Powershell and CMD\r\n\r\n#### Git\r\n\r\nThis occurred on 4774f9b523c942cb5c0236542b5bcac76f6b6b9a, but I haven't attempted to bisect for the root cause yet\r\n\r\n#### config.toml\r\n\r\nThese were the only configuration values that I changed\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[llvm]\r\nassertions = true\r\n\r\n[build]\r\nverbose = 1\r\nprofiler = true\r\n\r\n[rust]\r\ndebug = true\r\ncodegen-units = 0\r\ndebug-assertions = true\r\nbacktrace = true\r\nparallel-compiler = true\r\n```\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Kixiron", "id": 25047011, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDQ3MDEx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25047011?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kixiron", "html_url": "https://github.com/Kixiron", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kixiron/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kixiron/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kixiron/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kixiron/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kixiron/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kixiron/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kixiron/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kixiron/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kixiron/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/72523/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/72523/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
