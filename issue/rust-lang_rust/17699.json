The implementation isn't in scope indeed, but I think it should try to inference it, since the object is in scope.  \nHere is an example:\n\n``` rust\n#![feature(globs)]\n\nmod some_mod {\n  pub struct Foo;\n\n  pub trait Bar {\n    fn foo(&self);\n  }\n\n  impl Bar for Foo {\n    fn foo(&self) {\n      println!(\"I am Foo!\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n  //uncommenting the following line will fix the issue\n  //use some_mod::*;\n  let x = some_mod::Foo;\n  x.foo();\n}\n```\n\nI think I should be able to call x.foo() even if the implementation isn't in scope. It is in the same module as the struct though.  \nWhen implementing the method without implementing a trait it compiles even without the `use some_mod::*;`:\n\n``` rust\nmod some_mod {\n  pub struct Foo;\n\n  impl Foo {\n    pub fn foo(&self) {\n      println!(\"I am Foo!\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n  let x = some_mod::Foo;\n  x.foo();\n}\n```\n\nI guess it should have the same behavior on traits.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/17699/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/17699/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
