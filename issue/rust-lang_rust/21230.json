This has several problems:\n1. The key is very easy to find out (looking at build logs, running `strings` etc);\n2. Key generation is not cross platform. On BSDs and OS Xs the generated key is well known and currently is equal to `N`;\n3. It broke snapshots.\n\nThe proposed solution is to build two different versions of rustc for stage2/3 instead, depending on the situation:\n1. stage2/3 [src/driver/driver.rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f3d71be65cccfddd232e733c11129ed53961f980/src/driver/driver.rs) which can process unstable libraries (e.g. using `--cfg enable_unstable);\n2. stage2/3 libraries are built;\n3. stage2/3 [src/driver/driver.rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f3d71be65cccfddd232e733c11129ed53961f980/src/driver/driver.rs) which cannot process unstable libraries;\n4. Proper binary is packaged/shipped depending on the channel.\n\nThis has benefits of not having to do any environment variable dance during the build. It is also not really workaround-able without manually rebuilding rustc, unlike the current approach.\n\n(also see [logs](https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust-internals/2015-01-16/?msg=29746500&page=7))\n\ncc @brson, @eddyb \n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21230/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21230/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
