the steps or even link to a repository that causes\nthe problematic output to occur.\n-->\n\nGiven the following code: <!-- Please provide a link to play.rust-lang.org -->\n\n```rust\nstruct A;\n\nimpl A {\n    fn foo(&self) {\n    }\n}\nfn main() {\n    A.food()\n}\n```\n\nThe current output is:\n\n```\nerror[E0599]: no method named `food` found for struct `A` in the current scope\n -->

just spent a few hours not realizing I had a typo in the name because I was focussed on the method vs. associated function part of the error instead of realizing I was just missing a letter in the method name. Obviously the terminology is fine if there truly is nothing with a self, &self,... parameter but if the suggestion does have one it should be called a method in the suggestions.\n\n<!--\nIf dramatically different output is caused by small changes, consider also\nadding them here.\n\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions.
