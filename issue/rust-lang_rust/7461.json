It involves registering pairs of functions -- rust and rust, rust and C++, rust and LLVM -- and comparing the ratio of their outputs in terms of number of LLVM instructions and number of machine instructions.\n\nI think this is a nice category of test because:\n- it's mostly objective (subject to clang drift) and timing-insensitive so can be turned into a performance ratchet (see #7459)\n- it's easy to think of new testcases that \"should be equivalent\"\n- it's easy to turn existing performance problems into such testcases\n\nSome examples:\n- Manually inlined things vs. types of inlining we expect LLVM to do\n- Same for constant propagation\n- Same for type specialization\n- Comparing how we do these things vs. how C++/clang does them\n- Unsafe code vs. safe code for same operations\n- Match constructs vs. nested ifs\n- Iteration constructs vs. manual counter loops\n- Destructuring vs. field access\n", "closed_by": {"login": "graydon", "id": 14097, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDk3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14097?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon", "html_url": "https://github.com/graydon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7461/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7461/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
