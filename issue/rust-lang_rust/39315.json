However, this cannot be implemented without breaking changes to the current API (we need to run the callback from inside `phase_4_translate_to_llvm`, which doesn't have access to the `CompileController`).\r\n\r\nMaybe this is the moment to step back and review the current implementation of the `driver.rs` module. Particularly, I would like to propose making parts of the current implementation private and let the users interface with the compiler through `CompileController` only.
