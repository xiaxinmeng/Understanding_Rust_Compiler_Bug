It's also interesting that `iter` doesn't require `T: Ord`. These impls are much different from the ones in [`BTreeMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html), [`HashSet`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html), and [`HashMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html). I see no reason for why they should be written this way.\r\n\r\nShould we put all methods in just a single `impl<T> BTreeSet<T> where T: Ord` block instead?\r\n\r\nTechnically, that'd be a breaking change since `iter` currently doesn't need `T: Ord`, but you can't construct a `BTreeSet` without the bound anyway. You can reach for `unsafe` to create a `BTreeSet<T>` even if `T` doesn't impl `Ord`, but it's very unlikely that such code exists in the wild. In any case, I'd consider the missing bound on `iter` simply a bug.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47138/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47138/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
