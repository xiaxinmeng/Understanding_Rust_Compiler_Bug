We really appreciate the work done here, as reproducible builds are a requirement for such a plan. However, while this allows the binary output of rustc to be reproducible, we have noticed that the (fully resolved) command-line itself ends up not being so. This destroys our ability to cache build objects between bots and/or developers, as any change in the command-line requires a recompilation (such as changing optimization flags).\r\n\r\nClang has resolved this by providing a -fdebug-compilation-dir flag, in addition to the equivalent of rustc's --remap-path-prefix (as -fdebug-prefix-map in Clang).\r\n\r\nThis problem is discussed, in the context of Clang, in this blog post: https://blog.llvm.org/2019/11/deterministic-builds-with-clang-and-lld.html\r\n\r\nWe would like to propose a similar flag for rustc. For simplicity we'd propose similar naming and behaviour as Clang's, in order to reuse previous work.\r\n\r\nrustc --debug-compilation-dir . would be exactly equivalent to rustc --remap-path-prefix $(pwd)=.\r\n\r\nIn terms of ordering and presidence, it can follow the exact same rules as multiple --remap-path-prefix arguments.\r\n\r\nI originally posted this in issue #38322 and moving to a separate issue here.", "closed_by": {"login": "ehuss", "id": 43198, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTk4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43198?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss", "html_url": "https://github.com/ehuss", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87325/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87325/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
