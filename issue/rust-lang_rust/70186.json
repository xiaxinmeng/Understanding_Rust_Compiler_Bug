See [the issue](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi/issues/267) for the details. I'm not exactly sure how the bug manifested itself, but I noticed that not waiting for the child process whose stdin or stdout is inherited from the parent process can lead to weird behavior.\r\n\r\nThat's why I suggest to add `#[must_use = \"this Child may still be attached to its parent process's stdin/stdout and must be handled\"]` to `std::process::Child`. Currently I can't think of a reason why someone would not use a `Child` and that's I think the compiler warnings on that will prevent more headaches than they will cause.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/70186/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/70186/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
