As by-char indexing is O(n), this will fall down horribly in any kind of code that needs to be fast.\n\nI think the way to do this is to always use byte offsets. This complicates the mental model of our strings a bit, and is not safe (you can pass a bogus middle-of-multibyte-char offset to slice), but it certainly beats O(n) access.\n\n(If we are so concerned about safety, we should not be representing strings as UTF8 byte sequences.)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "marijnh", "id": 144427, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144427?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh", "html_url": "https://github.com/marijnh", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1849/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1849/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
