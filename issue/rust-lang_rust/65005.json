A recently nightly change has apparently changed this behaviour into an error. The following builds on stable without warnings but errors on nightly:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn bugs(a: &mut [u8; 4], _: impl Fn(u8)) {\r\n    a[4];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that in monomorphic functions this is already an error in both version, though I do not know when this was introduced. That is, this is an error:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn bugs(a: &mut [u8; 4]) {\r\n    a[4];\r\n    // error: index out of bounds: the len is 4 but the index is 4\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also an error (in both versions) if the actual access is statically unreachable:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn bugs(a: &mut [u8; 4]) {\r\n    if false {\r\n        a[4];\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note**: This breaks `image` and everything that depends on it, **many versions**.\r\n\r\nThe `image` crate makes use of the index access in a macro where the alpha components of a pixel are accessed ([see here](https://github.com/image-rs/image/blob/0153ddd10061f538aea4659edfa6ebec1873a6ba/src/color.rs#L179-L185)). It properly guards this with a check on the component number but, statically speaking, the access exists in the CFG even for types without alpha components where the index is of course invalid. This seems like a regression that would usually have an incompatibility warning period.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Centril", "id": 855702, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTcwMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/855702?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril", "html_url": "https://github.com/Centril", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/65005/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/65005/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
