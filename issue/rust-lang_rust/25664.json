I filed a [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/kate-config/pull/9) to fix that, but there are others.\n- crates.io-index - I'm not sure if this needs a copyright license since it isn't a work of creative expression, but it might still be worth putting something explicit in there just to fend off questions. Maybe there's some sort of 'open-data' license that's appropriate.\n- blog.rust-lang.org\n- regex - Declared in Cargo.toml but no accompanying license files.\n- rfcs - This is a mess. It should have the MIT/ASL license per our other docs but we didn't have the foresight to do it.\n- rust-buildbot\n- meeting-minutes - Doesn't matter probably.\n- rust-www - This is tricky. It contains a COPYRIGHT file, but I believe we put it there to have a license to link to for Rust itself. We can probably argue that the entire website falls under that license.\n- rust.vim\n- rust-mode\n- rust-packaging\n- gedit-config\n- rustup - rustup.sh itself contains the license, but not the rest.\n- rust-installer - ditto\n- rust-wiki-backup - decomissioned partially because it was not properly licensed\n- rust-guidelines\n- nano-config - Only contains copyright notice, not license.\n- zsh-config\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25664/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25664/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
