Using f32 keys in `BTreeMap`s by casting it to a `dyn Trait` that implements `Ord`, it's not UB but it breaks basic assurances that most code depends on. Since `dyn Traits` don't implicitly cast this will only happen if the user wants to, but it still allows you to bypass the orphan rules without a NewType. I don't know if it's bad nor if something can be done (since a breaking change may not be possible), but maybe someone can extend this to break some bigger assumptions.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let mut btree = BTreeMap::new();\r\n    btree.insert(&0.0f32 as &dyn MyOrd, true);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full code is here, it doesn't do anything that works, it was just a quick experiment.\r\nhttps://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=289f9f181c238aabd731ea16befcc1e6", "closed_by": {"login": "jonas-schievink", "id": 1786438, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY0Mzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786438?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonas-schievink", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66939/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66939/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
