Since these constants are private, they normally do not appear in documentation, but they do appear if a downstream crate uses `--document-private-items`.\r\n\r\nThe constants are annotated with `#[doc(hidden)]`, so they can be hidden from documentation by using `--document-private-items` in tandem with `--passes strip-hidden`, but the `--passes` flag is deprecated.\r\n\r\nIdeally, `--document-private-items` would be modified to still strip hidden items, because I believe that this is the more common use case. `#[doc(hidden)]` is generally used for implementation details (hygiene, `__Nonexhaustive`, etc.), and likely shouldn't ever actually be in the documentation, even for crates that want to document private items. Perhaps the current behavior could be renamed to `--document-hidden-items`. However, `--document-private-items` is stable, so I don't think this change can be made.\r\n\r\nInstead, I propose adding (and eventually stabilizing) a new flag for rustdoc that has the same effect as `--document-private-items` and `--passes strip-hidden`. Something like `--document-private-items=exclude-hidden`?", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60884/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60884/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
