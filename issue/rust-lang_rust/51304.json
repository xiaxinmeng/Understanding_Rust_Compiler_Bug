Comparing with wasm code produced on Ubuntu with the same version of Rustc shows that the wasm I get is smaller and contains many references to a variable named `env`, along with functions supposedly imported from `env`.\r\n\r\nThis sounds a lot like a link problem, but I don't know how to debug these, since the temporary files produced by Rustc before calling `lld` seem to get wiped off as soon as `lld` finishes its job.\r\n\r\nSome NixOS-specific problems include the path to `lld`, but it seems the patched version supplied by rustup is the first in the path (at least from the command-line, I hope `rustc` looks for its linker in the same order as the shell).", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51304/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51304/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
