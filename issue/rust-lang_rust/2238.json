meeting](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2012-04-17), let's create a single command-line interface that encompasses all of the rust tooling, and presents a simple and consistent experience for all aspects of rust programming.\n\nWe currently have three tools, rustc, cargo and rustdoc, and we will likely soon bee writing a bunch of new build logic for #2237. \n\nGo has a [`go` command](http://golang.org/doc/articles/go_command.html) that is a one-stop shop for working on go projects. We should learn from this. I thought this description of their motivation rang a bell:\n\n> An explicit goal for Go from the beginning was to be able to build Go code using only the information found in the\n> source itself, not needing to write a makefile or one of the many modern replacements for makefiles. If Go needed\n> a configuration file to explain how to build your program, then Go would have failed.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2238/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2238/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
