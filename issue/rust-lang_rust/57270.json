I checked the assembly code and it seems like it loads the first field of the exception stack frame instead of the error code, i.e. it is off by 8 bytes, so this seems to be a bug in LLVM. The interesting thing is that the error code is correct in release mode.\r\n\r\nIt worked correctly with nightly `(9389e23a8 2017-12-31)`, so it is a regression. I'm currently trying different Rust versions to find out when the problem was introduced:\r\n\r\nNightly | Works?\r\n-----| ------\r\n(9389e23a8 2017-12-31) | Yes\r\n(8ccab7eed 2018-01-31) | Yes\r\n(bd98fe0c0 2018-02-06) | Yes\r\n(3bcda48a3 2018-02-09) | Yes\r\n(45fba43b3 2018-02-10) | No\r\n(b8398d947 2018-02-11) | No\r\n(4d2d3fc5d 2018-02-13) | No\r\n(0ff9872b2 2018-02-28) | No\r\n(1ffb32147 2018-05-31) | No\r\n(f4a421ee3 2018-12-13) | No\r\n\r\n**Edit**: The problem was introduced between the 2018-02-09 and the 2018-02-10 nightly.
