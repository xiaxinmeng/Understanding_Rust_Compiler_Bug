In other words, that bind code is equivalent to `let x = ~3 in fn () -> foo(x)` (in some weird O'Caml/Rust hybrid) but it would need to be `fn() -> let x = ~3 in foo(x)` to be safe. \n\nNot sure the best fix here.  One thought is to ensure that bind `let b = bind f(E1, ..., En)` is syntactic sugar for something like:\n\n```\nlet b = {\n    let v1 = E1;\n    ...\n    let vN = En;\n    lambda() { f(v1, ..., vN) }\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly, upvars in lambdas should have reference mode (referencing the environment, not creator stack frame) which would prevent moves.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "marijnh", "id": 144427, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144427?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh", "html_url": "https://github.com/marijnh", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1261/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1261/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
