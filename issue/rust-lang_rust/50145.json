(And unfortunately doesn\u2019t discuss why.)\r\n\r\nMaybe it\u2019s fine to move them back in libcore? (As inherent methods, assuming #49896 lands.)\r\n\r\nCC @alexcrichton ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/50145/reactions", "total_count": 9, "+1": 9, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/50145/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
