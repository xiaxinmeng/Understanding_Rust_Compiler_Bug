Aside from trying to wrap my head around the difference between str and String (not helped by everyone calling them both \"string\" all the time), I noticed that RBE has this line:\n\n``` rust\nlet mut chars: Vec<char> = pangram.chars().collect();\n```\n\nRBE doesn't explain what `.collect()` does, so I tried looking it up in the docs. `.chars()` returns a `Chars` iterator. But looking at the `Chars` page (http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/struct.Chars.html) it has no information for `.collect()` (neither does the page for `Iterator`). Shouldn't that page list all of `Chars`'s methods and where they come from? Is this a bug in the documentation?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "kmcallister", "id": 444997, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDk5Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/444997?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister", "html_url": "https://github.com/kmcallister", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19829/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19829/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
