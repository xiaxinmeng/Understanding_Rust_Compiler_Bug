The rules for linking are mysterious enough that a contributor cannot be confident that they will work without running `make docs`. \n# Examples of pain\n\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32130: a struct can be viewed from two locations, at varying depths of links; sometimes links to methods refer to the wrong modules.\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/35880: doc entities are replicated between `std` and `core`.\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/35759: directory links are confusing; anchors are case sensitive and do not match rendered content.\n[#rust-docs logs](https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust-docs/2016-09-09/?msg=72755803&page=1): Linkchecker is not always reliable (or potentially has usability problems).\n[#rust-docs logs](https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust-docs/2016-09-14/?msg=73036621&page=2): If a URL is present in both item description and short description, in the second case it won't work.\n# Potential resolutions\n\nMy hope is that this problem is procedural. It's entirely likely that I'm just wrong! If that's the case, then this issue can be resolved with documentation that either: 1) specifies a fast way to programmatically check docs locally, or 2) specifies a deterministic set of rules (a checklist) that allows a contributor to verify that their links will be successful _without_ compiling them.\n\nIf I'm _not_ wrong, then the problem becomes more difficult, which is why I created this issue. I appreciate any insight from more experienced members of the community.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36417/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36417/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
