This ended up breaking [Wasmtime's build](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/actions/runs/4048924720/jobs/6964738137) because our files are built in a container with a different user and aren't then readable outside of the container. There's no particular reason we do this and we can work around this, but I also suspected that the change in permissions here probably wasn't intentional.\r\n\r\nI think this is due to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/97485 (cc @bjorn3), specifically [this line](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/001a77fac33f6560ff361ff38f661ff5f1c6bf85/compiler/rustc_codegen_ssa/src/back/archive.rs#L279). I haven't dug too deeply but my guess is that temp files specifically turn off other permission bits", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/107495/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/107495/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
