Although the text suggests it should (we are comparing execution time in different languages after all).\n\nHowever, if I modify the code to return, say, the count in the spawned thread (and later do `.join().unwrap()`, the execution time starts depending on the number of iterations.\n\nThis seems not to depend on the number of iterations:\n\n```\npub extern fn process() {\n    let handles: Vec<_> = (0..10).map(|_| {\n        thread::spawn(|| {\n            let mut _x = 0;\n            for _ in (0..900_000_001) {\n                _x += 1\n            }\n        })\n    }).collect();\n\n    for h in handles {\n        h.join().unwrap();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis seems to get slower with more iterations (as it should):\n\n```\npub extern fn process() {\n    let handles: Vec<_> = (0..10).map(|_| {\n        thread::spawn(|| {\n            let mut _x = 0;\n            for _ in (0..900_000_001) {\n                _x += 1\n            }\n            _x  // This line makes execution time depend on the number of iterations\n        })\n    }).collect();\n\n    for h in handles {\n        h.join().unwrap();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhy is this so? Is this some sort of compiler optimisation that removes the loop execution altogether? Should the code in the book be updated?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25855/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25855/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
