This was done because there is no legal entity named \"The Rust Project Developers\" holding the copyright. However, this implies that groups who aren't legal entities don't deserve attribution, which I don't think is true. Also, this might be a license violation, since most rust developers never agreed to the removal. Therefore, I'd like to propose adding the following copyright notice:\r\n\r\nCopyright \\<year\\> various Rust Project\r\nDevelopers\r\n\r\nThis could also be interpreted as a violation of the license of pre-2015 code, as it's not exactly the copyright notice required, but that would also mean that changing the year is a license violation, yet most projects keep the year up-to-date.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/105621/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/105621/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
