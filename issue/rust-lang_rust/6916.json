The service as a whole could run in a VM since it's still vulnerable to a kernel exploit in one of the whitelisted system calls.\n\nSince `rustc` uses at least 70MiB of memory and up to 128-150MiB for reasonably small examples, we'll need to limit the concurrency based on the chosen resource limit for the sandbox and the memory available.\n\nThis would be a nice way to let people try to language before going through the relatively long compile.\n## \n# TODO list\n- [x] ec2 instance - playtest.rust-lang.org\n- [ ] styling the same as the main rust website\n- [x] DNS record for `play.rust-lang.org` (or some similar name)\n- [x] ability to submit code to the server and have it compiled/run\n- [ ] rustdoc integration -- links on all code examples to submit and compile.
