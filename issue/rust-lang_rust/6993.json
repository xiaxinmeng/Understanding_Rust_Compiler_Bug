After expansion, this is collapsed down to a single Name (an index into the interner). However, the downstream stuff in librustc refers to \"ast::ident\" everywhere.  It would save space and time to just pass around one int rather than two, by replacing uses of \"ident\" with \"Name\". I don't know if I'll have time to do this.
