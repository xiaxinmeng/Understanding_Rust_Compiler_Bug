I'm never confident in what `rustc_inherit_overflow_checks` does.  (And I hear that one can use `Add::add(count, 1)` instead of using the attribute.)\r\n\r\nWhile adding more tests is better, I don't agree with removing the attribute. If anything the attribute should be better documented, but relying on more implicit mechanisms that internally use the attribute obscures the fact that something *unusual* is happening.\r\n(i.e. that some of the behavior isn't decided by the crate being compiled, but by a downstream using crate)\r\n\r\nThe reason `Add::add` works at all is because the attribute is used in the `impl`s` for the integer types, e.g.:\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/186f7ae5b04d31d8ccd1746ac63cdf1ab4bc2354/library/core/src/ops/arith.rs#L92-L107\r\n\r\nThere's nothing magical about it being a trait call, you're just calling another function with `#[rustc_inherit_overflow_checks]` on it, instead of using `#[rustc_inherit_overflow_checks]` yourself, and relying on generic/`#[inline]` instantiation to get the behavior.\r\n\r\nThe only reason the trait impls have the attribute is because of things generic over those traits, not to call directly.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: see also documentation issue by @m-ou-se at https://github.com/rust-lang/std-dev-guide/issues/13", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/81721/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/81721/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
