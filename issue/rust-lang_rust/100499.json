I have been working on implementing this as a part of my Google Summer of Code 2022 project. Information about the current state of this implementation can be found at `src/doc/rustc/src/platform-support/unknown-uefi.md`. A PR has already been opened [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100316)\r\n\r\nFor those who are wondering how a target like UEFI can benefit from std support, here are a few examples:\r\n1. Writing UEFI shell applications. This includes stuff like benchmarks, self-test utilities, etc. Many drivers should also be able to use std.\r\n2. Finding UEFI target bugs. During this work, I have found 3 numeric tests that cause CPU exceptions for UEFI (they are fixed now. Also, I have found 2 additional bugs (which seem like bugs in llvm soft-float) which went unnoticed because there was no easy way to do any broad testing.\r\n3. Provide a stable interface for library developers. The current std contains some functions under std::os::uefi::env to provide access to the underlying SystemTable and SystemHandle, which are essential for writing anything for UEFI.\r\n\r\n# Public API\r\nAPIs I propose to add under `std::os::uefi::env`:\r\n\r\n1. `pub fn get_system_table() -> NonNull<c_void>`\r\n2. `pub fn get_system_handle() -> NonNull<c_void>`\r\n3. `pub fn init_globals(handle: NonNull<c_void>, system_table: NonNull<c_void>)`\r\n\r\nAPIs I propose to add under `std::os::uefi::ffi` (Just re-export `std::os::windows::ffi`)\r\n\r\n1. trait `OsStrExt`\r\n2. trait `OsStringExt`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100499/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100499/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
