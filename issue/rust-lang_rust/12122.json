Generally, the only new language features added after this milestone must be backwards compatible, or to fix soundness holes, though we do expect to have some leeway to make small incompatible fixes that have low impact on existing code bases.\r\n\r\n* Library stability - We have a system of measuring and ensuring the stability of API's, and a significant portion of the standard library is declared stable. Stable API's will not change. Large portions of the standard library need to be stable for 1.0, including primitive types, vectors, strings, option, numerics, collections, some I/O and concurrency.\r\n\r\n* User experience - The system is polished and the presentation is complete and professional. New users have a clear path to using and learning the system. This encompasses the web site, documentation, installation, and tooling.\r\n", "creator": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 376, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2013-10-10T18:48:33Z", "updated_at": "2016-08-28T23:13:24Z", "due_on": "2015-05-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2015-05-21T20:59:13Z"}, "comments": 18, "created_at": "2014-02-09T06:42:04Z", "updated_at": "2015-04-02T21:33:17Z", "closed_at": "2015-04-02T21:33:17Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "This uses the `log_syntax!` macro without the `log_syntax` feature gate:\n\n```\n#[feature(macro_rules)];\n// This should be required\n// #[feature(log_syntax)];\n\nmacro_rules! hey ( () => { log_syntax!() } )\n\nfn main() {\n    hey!()                                                                                         \n}\n```\n\nNominating.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pnkfelix", "id": 173127, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173127?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix", "html_url": "https://github.com/pnkfelix", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12122/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12122/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
