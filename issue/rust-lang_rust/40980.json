In the comment at https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/36958#issuecomment-255461415 Niko mentions that this is worth removing when the upstream LLVM bug is fixed (per that comment's suggestion I'm also presumptuously tagging this as P-medium). I know we have an upgrade to LLVM 4.0 in the works ( https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/37609 ), so that may fix it. **However**, what is our policy on compiling on old versions of LLVM, for the sake of rustc distribution in distros that ship their own LLVM? If we need to remain compatible with old versions of LLVM, then the workaround may need to exist for quite a long time.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40980/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40980/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
