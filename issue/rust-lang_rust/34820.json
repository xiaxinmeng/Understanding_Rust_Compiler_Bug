I wonder how far this should be taken, but I wanted to suggest that the compiler warns if a guard clause would make the code more readable (IMHO). I think of situations where a complete block has only one expression that is an if, e.g.:\n\n```\n  for (i, char) in str.char_indices() {\n    if &char == sep {\n      // do lots of things\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nIt might be easier to read (because you don't need to nest/indent so deep) if you would use a guard clause, especially if the block body is large:\n\n```\n  for (i, char) in str.char_indices() {\n    if &char != sep { continue }\n    // do lots of things\n  }\n```\n\nI understand that this is highly subjective, but it might be something that makes the code more readable.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34820/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34820/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
