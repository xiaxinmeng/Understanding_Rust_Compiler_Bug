It encourages a newcomer to Rust to expect the opposite of what he will experience in the ecosystem and stdlib, where things being `Copy` is the exception, not the norm. As a rule of thumb, almost all \"normal\" types are _not_ `Copy` to preserve move semantics (detached copies being a mistake, unless explicit through `Clone`) and the performance penalties that come with it.\r\nMaybe a more nuanced approach to `When should my type be Copy` is better suited.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm sorry if this has been bikeshedded previously, feel free to shoot it down.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66588/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66588/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
