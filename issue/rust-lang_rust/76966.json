For example, an introduction, or usage notes.\r\n\r\nBut, anomalously, that information is not shown at docs.rs and nor is included in rustdoc output.\r\n\r\nThis is confusing, because it means that when browsing crates online, the link in crates.io to \"documentation\" goes to a site which somehow doesn't have the documentation one was just looking at!\r\n\r\nAnd it is a serious nuisance if one is using cargo doc to generate a documentation set for working offline: the resulting documentation is missing important parts.\r\n\r\nI found #44732 and #66249 which seem to be related.  In this issue I'm asking that `README.md` should be processed *by default*, and put somewhere prominent in the rustdoc output.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76966/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76966/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
