While the libc crate has [very complicated logic](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/search?q=%22pub+type+c_long%22) to determine how the `c_*` types are defined, the standard library uses a [much simpler logic](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/81622c6b02536bdcf56145beb317da0d336703c1/src/libstd/os/raw.rs).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how much these types are desired outside of libc; the only type that I've really seen used across the standard library is `c_char`, which honestly could just be replaced with an opaque struct with `repr(u8)` if it weren't already stabilised.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47027/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47027/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
