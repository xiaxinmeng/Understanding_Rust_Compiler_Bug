It acquires the [environment lock](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/66ec64ccf31883cd2c28d045912a76179c0c6ed2/library/std/src/sys/unix/os.rs#L497) before the fork, with a drop handler that unlocks it. Unfortunately, this is done in both the parent and child processes, and unlocking a lock acquired from another thread is undefined behavior (see [`pthread_rwlock_unlock`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_rwlock_unlock.html#tag_16_453) and [`pthread_mutex_unlock`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_mutex_lock.html#tag_16_439)).\r\n\r\nAn example of where this can happen is rustdoc running doctests.  It has N threads all spawning `rustc` processes.  It was observed in #82221 that this was frequently causing deadlocks (i686, on a Docker image with glibc 2.23).\r\n\r\nPR #82877 reverts the change from mutex to rwlock, but `pthread_mutex_unlock` is also undefined behavior, we just fortunately have not run into any problems.  This should be fixed.  This can probably be done by mem::forget'ing the guard.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/61976745/why-does-rust-rwlock-behave-unexpectedly-with-fork also provides some insight into why unlocking a rwlock after a fork doesn't work.\r\n\r\nrustc 1.52.0-nightly (caca2121f 2021-03-05)", "closed_by": {"login": "ehuss", "id": 43198, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTk4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43198?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss", "html_url": "https://github.com/ehuss", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82879/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82879/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
