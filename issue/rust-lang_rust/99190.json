Some additional examples:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// Broken\r\nasync fn frobnicate(_a: &str, _b: &'static bool, _c: &i32) {}\r\nasync fn frobnicate(_a: &'static str, _b: &bool, _c: &i32) {}\r\n\r\n// Not broken, only one generic lifetime\r\nasync fn frobnicate(_a: &str, _b: &'static bool) {}\r\nasync fn frobnicate(_a: &str, _b: &'static bool, _c: &'static i32) {}\r\n\r\n// Not broken, no static lifetime\r\nasync fn frobnicate(_a: &str, _b: &bool, _c: &i32) {}\r\n\r\n// Broken\r\nasync fn frobnicate(_a: &str, _b: &'static bool, _c: &'static i32, _d: &String) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- It doesn't appear to matter what order the lifetimes appear in, nor does it matter whether the lifetimes exist as part of a reference type (&'a T) or named type (Cow<'a, str>).\r\n- It doesn't matter whether or not the lifetimes are named or elided\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n\r\nThis bug is present on stable (1.62.0), beta (1.63.0-beta.5 2022-07-10 93ef0cd7fd86d3d05cee), and nightly (1.64.0-nightly 2022-07-11 38b72154ded23847cd08).\r\n\r\nPossibly related to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63033.\r\n\r\n### Diagnostics\r\n\r\nSeparate from the compiler bug here, there seems to be a related diagnostics bug, where the compiler describes some lifetime called `'_#23r` without pointing it out in the message.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/99190/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/99190/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
