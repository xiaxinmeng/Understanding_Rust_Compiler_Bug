However, exceptions are not allowed for the runtime crates that make up the standard library.\r\n> \r\n> With the `backtrace` feature, `std` depends on `object`. Then `object` has a conditional dependency on `indexmap`, but this is not enabled under `std`. However, if you look at the whole workspace metadata at once (as tidy does), then the compiler enables the `object` features that require `indexmap`, and now also the `indexmap` feature for `rustc-rayon` too.\r\n> \r\n> So tidy sees `std` -> `object` -> `indexmap` -> `rustc-rayon` -> `rustc-rayon-core` -> `crossbeam-queue` in the metadata, and thus includes *all* of that in \"runtime\" crates, and then the exception isn't allowed. But if you look at `cargo tree --all-features -p std`, they aren't really included at all.\r\n> \r\n_Originally posted by @cuviper in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90842#issuecomment-1007815922_", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/92677/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/92677/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
