The questions from there (such as consistency in order with `into_sorted_vec`) need to be addressed before a future attempt to stabilize.\r\n\r\nOriginal feature request:\r\n\r\n-----\r\nCurrently, both `BinaryHeap::into_iter` and `BinaryHeap::drain` yield the heap elements in an arbitrary order. This seems counter-intuitive given the nature of a heap. Sadly, we can't simply change their behavior behind the scenes, as we would have to remove the implementation of `DoubleEndedIterator`. Should we perhaps add `into_ordered_iter` and `drain_ordered`? The implementation is pretty straightforward so I'd be happy to submit a PR.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/59278/reactions", "total_count": 19, "+1": 19, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/59278/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
