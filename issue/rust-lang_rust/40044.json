platforms, the same Audio DSP algorithm runs slower when its buffer is backed by a `Vector` compared an `Array`.\r\nThe difference in speed measured in favor of `Array` vs `Vector` is typically -10% to +60%\r\n\r\nDue to the large performance gains observed especially on simpler and slower CPUs, it is tempting to replace idiomatic code by macros generating multiple functions which accept only fixed-size `Array` input.\r\nOtherwise, when performance matters it appears preferable to always work with slices of `Array` buffers of the maximum size needed instead of `Vector` unless they have to be dynamically resized.\r\n\r\nNote however that in this test, while the Rust implementation is often slower than GCC C++ with vector-backed buffers, it is usually close to the speed of when compiled by Clang C++ which is already good.\r\n\r\nThis [repository](https://github.com/supercurio/rust-vec-array-perf) contains Rust and C++ benchmarks for comparison.\r\nI collected [results on desktop, laptop, smartphone and tablets CPUs](https://github.com/supercurio/rust-vec-array-perf/tree/master/results), so you can see how much variation can be observed.\r\n\r\nRust versions: 1.14, 1.15.1,
