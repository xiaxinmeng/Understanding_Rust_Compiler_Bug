(see http://dl.rust-lang.org/doc/core/task.html#function-spawn_supervised).  The result is that the appearance in the html docs searchable from the website is using the description of spawn_unlinked repeated again for spawn_supervised, which is an inaccurate description, since supervisor(parent) death should cause child death but not vice-versa with spawn_supervised.\n\nHere is how the incorrect compilation reads:\n\"\"\"\nFunction spawn_supervised\n\nfn spawn_supervised(f: ~fn())\n\nCreates a child task unlinked from the current one. If either this task or the child task fails, the other will not be killed.\n\"\"\"\n\nIt is strange however that this seems to work fine a little further down for spawn_with, so perhaps the published html docs are just out of date.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "glycerine", "id": 445247, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTI0Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/445247?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/glycerine", "html_url": "https://github.com/glycerine", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glycerine/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glycerine/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glycerine/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glycerine/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glycerine/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glycerine/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glycerine/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glycerine/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glycerine/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8923/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8923/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
