I think we should call it `TyUnnormalizedProjection`. This would be entirely unused for now -- but when we start to enable chalk, we will create this type when translating user types directly, and only create `TyProjection` in the case that we have attempted to normalize the projection and failed.\r\n\r\ncc @tmandry @scalexm ", "closed_by": {"login": "scalexm", "id": 1173131, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjExNzMxMzE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1173131?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/scalexm", "html_url": "https://github.com/scalexm", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scalexm/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scalexm/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scalexm/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scalexm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scalexm/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scalexm/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scalexm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scalexm/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scalexm/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53683/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53683/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
