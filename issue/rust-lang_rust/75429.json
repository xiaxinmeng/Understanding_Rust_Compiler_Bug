An example would be [`std::poll::Poll`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/task/enum.Poll.html).\r\n\r\nOption and Result already share this behaviour:\r\n- and\r\n- and_then\r\n- or\r\n- or_else\r\n- map\r\n- map_or\r\n- map_or_else\r\n\r\nOption also has:\r\n- xor\r\n\r\nResult also has:\r\n- map_err\r\n\r\nThere are some other common methods, like `iter`, `unwrap` and some more. So this might be a more general question: Is it a good idea to put these methods into traits and implement them through those traits?\r\n\r\n_**Why would you need that?**_\r\nAlthough it will probably not provide a lot of code reuse, it does make these interfaces explicit and will make it more likely for crates to implement complete interfaces. This would discourage crates from implementing only `map` or only `and_then` or something like that. Also it might allow for generic programming against any type providing those methods.\r\nFor example `Poll` only implements `map` but not `and_then` or `or`, although these would make sense too.", "closed_by": {"login": "mankinskin", "id": 20745737, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzQ1NzM3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20745737?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mankinskin", "html_url": "https://github.com/mankinskin", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mankinskin/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mankinskin/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mankinskin/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mankinskin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mankinskin/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mankinskin/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mankinskin/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mankinskin/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mankinskin/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75429/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 4}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75429/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
