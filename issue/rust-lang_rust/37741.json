It took them a few hours, and turned out to be caused by an ambiguity in `next` method calls. Here's the example of the bug that they gave:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub trait Window {}\r\n\r\npub struct PistonWindow {}\r\nimpl Window for PistonWindow {}\r\n\r\n\r\nstruct WindowEvents {}\r\nimpl WindowEvents {\r\n    fn next<W: Window>(self, arg: &W) {\r\n        println!(\"WindowEvents::next\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ntrait EventWindow {\r\n    fn next(self, arg: &PistonWindow);\r\n}\r\nimpl EventWindow for WindowEvents {\r\n    fn next(self, arg: &PistonWindow) {\r\n        println!(\"EventWindow::next\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let struct1 = PistonWindow {};\r\n    let struct2 = WindowEvents {};\r\n    \r\n    struct2.next(&struct1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n[*playpen*](https://is.gd/ff2vnG)\r\n\r\nHere, I would normally assume rustc to throw an error about an ambiguity between the `next` method call, something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmultiple possible sources of next method:\r\n1. inherent method `WindowEvents::next`\r\n2. trait method `EventWindow::next`\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, the program compiles and the `WindowEvents` inherent method is called.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is expected behaviour and I'm missing something, but just thought I'd report in case.", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37741/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37741/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
