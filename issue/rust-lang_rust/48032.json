In that case, the logic should be reversed:\r\n\r\n- When true, do nothing\r\n- When false, add \"-no-pie\" to the command line\r\n\r\nThe obvious way to resolve this would be to pass \"-pie\" when true and \"-no-pie\" when false, but sadly, older versions of gcc will fail to link with \"-no-pie\" because it doesn't recognize that command line option and errors out.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the correct thing to do would be split the link step for gcc into two steps:\r\n\r\n1. call \"gcc -v\" to see if --enable-default-pie is set\r\n2. pass the appropriate pie flag to gcc based on this\r\n\r\nI think this is the root cause for these issues: #35061 #47037 \r\n\r\nIf you all agree this is the correct path and can give me a hint as to where/how this should be done I can take a stab at writing the code for it.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48032/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48032/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
