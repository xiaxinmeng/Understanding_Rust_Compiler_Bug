I'm speaking from experience, I first tried following the docs, but it turned out to be quite difficult to understand (the tools, not the docs), while `grcov` simplifies it a lot, but at first I didn't know about it, only found out about it recently from this blog post: [link](https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2021/03/24/rust-integrating-llvm-source-base-code-coverage-with-gitlab/).\r\n\r\nSo I just wanted to suggest that, maybe it could be helpful for others.\r\n\r\nI could even add a section myself, but I want to first make sure the doc team is on board.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/83520/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/83520/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
