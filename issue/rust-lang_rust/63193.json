Sometimes the code is not for testing at all (for example, writing pseudo-code for an algorithm), and we can add `ignore` at the beginning of the code block.\r\n\r\nHowever, even if `ignore` is added, `cargo test` still interprets the code block as doctest, and prints \"... ignored\" on each occurrence of `ignore`-tagged code blocks. In fact, those code blocks should not be interpreted as doctest, and `cargo test` should *silently* ignore those code blocks.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following code is a snippet of my current project.\r\n```rust\r\n/// Minimize the input size while preserving the coverage.\r\n///\r\n/// The algorithm trims by trying to remove chunks, starting from large chunks\r\n/// to small chunks.\r\n///\r\n/// # Algorithm\r\n/// ```ignore\r\n/// for round in rounds {\r\n///     for chunk_index in buffer {\r\n///         let new_buffer = remove_chunk(chunk_index, round_size);\r\n///         if run(new_buffer).coverage == known_coverage {\r\n///             buffer = new_buffer;\r\n///         }\r\n///     }\r\n/// }\r\n/// ```\r\npub struct Trim {\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`cargo test` generates the following output:\r\n```\r\n[...]\r\n   Doc-tests dfuzz\r\n\r\nrunning 4 tests\r\ntest src/algorithm/pass/mod.rs - algorithm::pass::Trim (line 17) ... ignored\r\ntest src/tracer/function.rs - tracer::function (line 18) ... ignored\r\ntest src/tracer/function.rs - tracer::function (line 23) ... ignored\r\ntest src/tracer/function.rs - tracer::function (line 5) ... ignored\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it possible to add a flag in the code block to suppress such \"ignored\" messages?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63193/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 6, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63193/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
