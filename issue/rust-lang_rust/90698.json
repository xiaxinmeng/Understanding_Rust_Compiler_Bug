But there's no way to get a backtrace there without rebuilding the compiler from source. It would be really cool if there were a way to have backtraces for each individual logging call. To avoid making the compiler horrifically slow, it could be behind a `-Zlog-backtrace=filter` flag.\n\nThis would be useful even if you have a local build of the compiler, since you don't have to rebuild it each time you want to get a stack trace.\n\n@davidbarsky suggests doing this by adding a custom [`Layer`](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/0.3.1/tracing_subscriber/fmt/struct.Layer.html) which filters [based on a string](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/0.3.1/tracing_subscriber/filter/targets/struct.Targets.html#method.with_target).
