But if I uncomment the line, i.e. run this:\r\n```rust\r\nfn function() {}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let size = 1_u8;\r\n    function();\r\n    0 - size;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nInstead, this happens:\r\n```\r\n   Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)\r\nwarning: unused arithmetic operation that must be used\r\n --> src/main.rs:6:5\r\n  |\r\n6 |     0 - size;\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^\r\n  |\r\n  = note: `#[warn(unused_must_use)]` on by default\r\n\r\nwarning: 1 warning emitted\r\n\r\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.56s\r\n     Running `target/debug/playground`\r\nthread 'main' panicked at 'attempt to subtract with overflow', src/main.rs:6:5\r\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\r\n```\r\nI don't know but this doesn't seem right. This empty function call without any meaning has an effect on whether I will get a compile time error or a runtime error.\r\nIt's very simplified here but on a high level in my abstracted code it was very confusing.\r\nI don't think the function call should have an effect on the line below it. \r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n\r\nThis happens on the stable (1.51.1), beta and nightly channel.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "r00ster91", "id": 35064754, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDY0NzU0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35064754?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91", "html_url": "https://github.com/r00ster91", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r00ster91/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/83808/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/83808/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
