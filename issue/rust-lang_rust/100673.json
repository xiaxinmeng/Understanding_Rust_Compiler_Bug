This causes rust to panic, rather than try to print the same buffer again.\r\n\r\nAn example of when O_NONBLOCK is set on stdio is when using qemu serial.\r\n\r\nI made an attempt to handle EAGAIN for std::io(https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/100594), but it was on generic code so not the right approach. Maybe there is a better approach to handle EAGAIN specifically for std::io and not panic?\r\n\r\nTo test this just change the stdout to O_NONBLOCK and then create 10 threads to print to stdout, C++ is able to print and finish to completion, but rust panics and crashes, so I think glibc also probably has similar support for O_NONBLOCK for stdout.\r\n\r\nThanks", "closed_by": {"login": "joshtriplett", "id": 162737, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjczNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162737?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett", "html_url": "https://github.com/joshtriplett", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100673/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100673/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
