A faster version looks like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n    let stdout = io::stdout();\r\n    let mut handle = stdout.lock();\r\n    handle.write_all(b\"hello world\")?;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll pages linked do provide this example code, but do not explain **why** this more verbose version is beneficial, instead simply titling it \"Using explicit synchronization:\". None of these pages mention performance at all.\r\n\r\nThe relation of `stdout` to buffering is not documented. Does and `stdout` need to be wrapped into `BufReader`? What about the explicitly locked version? Locked `stdin` is documented to provide `BufReader` methods, but again there is no mention of performance.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/106133/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/106133/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
