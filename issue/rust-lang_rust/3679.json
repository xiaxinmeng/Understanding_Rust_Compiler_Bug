I can see checking for errors on a descriptor being written to (the close will often flush buffered data), but failing because close failed for reads seems a lot iffier.\n- All the error checking in isaac_seed (including Windows) is using asserts which seems questionable: usually those should be reserved to catch errors programmers make, not arbitrary errors the runtime will throw up (especially if those errors may be ifdef'ed out). \n- It'd be great if the Unix code used perror.\n\nThis was on a Mac. I note that `man 2 close` lists three reasons why close may fail including the perennial favorite \"execution was interrupted by a signal\".\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3679/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3679/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
