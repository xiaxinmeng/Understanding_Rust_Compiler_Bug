This is pretty reasonable, but it does create false dead-code warnings when one has structs that exist solely to be debug printed. As evidenced by #88900, users are confused by this in practice.\r\n\r\n@pmetzger had a [good suggestion](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88900#issuecomment-991634289):\r\n\r\n> Even if this warning is reasonable, it would be a good idea if the message explained that derive(Debug) is ignored for purposes of the lint. As it happens, I spent a lot of time tearing my hair out trying to figure out why the warning was being triggered. (In my case I have structs that exist only to be dumped to a log using debug prints.)\r\n\r\nI think the ideal would be to note that an \"ignored impl\" is present and issue a `note` on the lint. I'm not sure how easy that would be to do!", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/92726/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/92726/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
