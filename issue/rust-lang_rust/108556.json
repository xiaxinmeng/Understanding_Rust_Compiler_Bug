Starting from Rust 1.42.0, those targets will be demoted to Tier 3.\r\n\r\nIt seems unlikely that (1.41.0 was the last version with these targets undemoted AND 1.42.0 was the first version with them demoted), because there was a release between them: 1.41.1.  The release notes for 1.41.1 and 1.42.0 do not mention these targets.  I would guess the targets were demoted in 1.42.0 and still supported as before in 1.41.1, making 1.41.0 not actually the last release with them undemoted.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest that a clarifying note be added in the release notes, the blog post, or both, noting whether 1.41.1 also supports those targets undemoted.", "closed_by": {"login": "workingjubilee", "id": 46493976, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDkzOTc2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46493976?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee", "html_url": "https://github.com/workingjubilee", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108556/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108556/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
