This seems to be not quite optimal for structs like this:\n\n``` rust\n#[deriving(Show)]\nstruct RGBA {\n    r: u8,\n    g: u8,\n    b: u8,\n    a: u8,\n}\n\n#[inline(never)]\nfn gradient(from: RGBA, to: RGBA) {\n    println!(\"Gradient from {} to {}\", from, to);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let from = RGBA { r: 0, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0 };\n    let to = RGBA { r: 255, g: 255, b: 255, a: 255 };\n    gradient(from, to);\n    gradient(to, from);\n}\n```\n\nThe calls end up being lowered to this:\n\n``` asm\n    movl    $255, 8(%rsp)\n    movl    $255, (%rsp)\n    xorl    %edi, %edi\n    xorl    %esi, %esi\n    xorl    %edx, %edx\n    xorl    %ecx, %ecx\n    movl    $255, %r8d\n    movl    $255, %r9d\n    callq   _ZN8gradient20h9b7e3615552adffcPcaE\n    movl    $0, 8(%rsp)\n    movl    $0, (%rsp)\n    movl    $255, %edi\n    movl    $255, %esi\n    movl    $255, %edx\n    movl    $255, %ecx\n    xorl    %r8d, %r8d\n    xorl    %r9d, %r9d\n    callq   _ZN8gradient20h9b7e3615552adffcPcaE\n```\n\nSo to pass effectively 8 bytes, we need 6 registers and 16 bytes of stack.\n\nFor return values, this also means that such structs in fact isn't return as an immediate values in the `eax` register, but in memory. Using 4 single byte movs (maybe coalescing those into a single store is something that could be handled in LLVM, but it still seems bad that it goes through memory).\n\nMaybe the rust ABI should be re-evaluated and we need to add casts/coercions for small structs to pass them more efficiently. Passing e.g. slices in registers instead of memory also seems like it might be a good idea. I'm far off from being an expert in this area though, so feel free to correct me if things are fine as they are.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "huonw", "id": 1203825, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDM4MjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1203825?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw", "html_url": "https://github.com/huonw", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16506/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16506/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
