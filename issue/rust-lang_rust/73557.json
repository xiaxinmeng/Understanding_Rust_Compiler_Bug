Make sure to include the relevant\r\n   RFC for the feature if it has one. Otherwise provide a short summary of the\r\n   feature and link any relevant PRs or issues, and remove any sections that are\r\n   not relevant to the feature.\r\n\r\n   Remember to add team labels to the tracking issue.\r\n   For a language team feature, this would e.g., be `T-lang`.\r\n   Such a feature should also be labeled with e.g., `F-my_feature`.\r\n   This label is used to associate issues (e.g., bugs and design questions) to the feature.\r\n   -->\r\n\r\n   The feature gate for the issue is `#![feature(repr_align_struct_fields)]`. The original reported issue is **https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73358**\r\n\r\n   ### About tracking issues\r\n\r\n   Tracking issues are used to record the overall progress of implementation.\r\n   They are also uses as hubs connecting to other relevant issues, e.g., bugs or open design questions.\r\n   A tracking issue is however *not* meant for large scale discussion, questions, or bug reports about a feature.\r\n   Instead, open a dedicated issue for the specific matter and add the relevant feature gate label.\r\n\r\n   ### Steps\r\n   <!--\r\n   Include each step required to complete the feature. Typically this is a PR\r\n   implementing a feature, followed by a PR that stabilises the feature. However\r\n   for larger features an implementation could be broken up into multiple PRs.\r\n   -->\r\n\r\n   - [ ] Implemented\r\n   - [ ] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][doc-guide])\r\n   - [ ] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][stabilization-guide])\r\n\r\n   [stabilization-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr\r\n   [doc-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#documentation-prs\r\n\r\n   ### Unresolved Questions\r\n   <!--\r\n   Include any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\n   stabilised.\r\n   -->\r\n\r\n   ### Implementation history\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "scottmcm", "id": 18526288, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTI2Mjg4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18526288?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm", "html_url": "https://github.com/scottmcm", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottmcm/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73557/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73557/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
