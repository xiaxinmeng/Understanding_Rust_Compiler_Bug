The somewhat vague reason for this is that _weak pointers may not belong in this module_. Now this has been addressed multiple times in #24028 and I have been observing this situation for a few months. However, as far as I can tell, nothing has happened so far.\n\nStabilizing my FRP library Carboxyl is currently blocked on this issue (see aepsil0n/carboxyl#47). Hence, I would really, really love to see this stabilized.\n\nSo my main question there is: is it really, as the instability note indicates, just a matter of discussing whether it should be moved to another module? Or is there anything more to it? In either case I would be happy to help out with anything that needs doing.\n\nI did some archeology on the git logs. And, apparently @brson marked `alloc::rc::Weak` as unstable a year ago in cf8bfde. Shortly thereafter, @alexcrichton adapted this policy to `alloc::arc::Weak` in e5da6a7. So perhaps one of you could comment on the motivation behind that and whether it still applies today?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27465/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27465/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
