I don't know if it should be, but it causes the compiler to blow its stack when recursively traversing a crate which contains it.\n\nTo reproduce:\n- Create a lib crate `foo` with this body: (compiles fine)\n\n```\npub mod foo {\n    pub use super::*;\n}\n```\n- Link to this crate, then include code that results in a method missing error, such as:\n\n```\nextern crate foo;\n\npub fn main() {\n    0.flibbertigibit();\n}\n```\n\nThis will cause the stack to overflow in while it looks up traits in linked crates that define a method `flibbertigibit()`. There are probably other functions which overflow like this in the case of this text.\n\nI would think either `super::*` should be smart enough to not recursively include the self module or `super::*` should be an error.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29181/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29181/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
