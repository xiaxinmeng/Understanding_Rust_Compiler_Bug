https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81490.\r\n\r\nIf you try to combine `+whole-archive` with (possibly implicit) `+bundle` you will encounter this error: [\"linking modifiers `+bundle` and `+whole-archive` are not compatible with each other when generating rlibs\"](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_codegen_ssa/src/back/link.rs#L324-L332).\r\nThe `whole-archive` modifier is significantly limited due to this issue and cannot be used in `foo-sys` rlibs bundling their native `libfoo.a` dependencies, which is one of the main use cases.\r\n\r\nWe also have to enable the `+whole-archive` modifier implicitly in one ad hoc case (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_codegen_ssa/src/back/link.rs#L2209-L2213) for backward compatibility, because it cannot be enabled manually.\r\n\r\n`cfg` for bundled static libraries was implemented just enough to make the case of musl libc bundled into [libc crate](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc) to work, but it doesn't work in general case.\r\n(Note that musl libc no longer uses bundling, see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/72274.)\r\n\r\nAlso see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88085 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88161 for some discussion related to this
