If you document this code with `cargo doc`, the [src] link at the top of *struct.S.html* points to the line `pub struct $name $body`, as far as I can tell because this is where the first non-attribute token (`pub`) of the final struct definition came from.\r\n\r\nI propose that it would be more often correct to have [src] point to wherever the \\*name\\* token of the item came from, in this case the $name token which originates from the line `pub struct S`.", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47817/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47817/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
