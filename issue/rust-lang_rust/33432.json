For example, in this code snippet:-\n\n``` rust\nextern crate libc;\nuse self::libc::c_int;\n\n#[repr(c_int)]\npub enum Facility\n{\n    LOG_KERN = self::libc::LOG_KERN,\n    // ... Omitted ...\n}\n```\n\n(Note, `LOG_KERN` is not yet defined in `libc`, but I'm working on a PR for it). The type alias for `LOG_KERN` is `c_int`, which resolves to `i32` on Mac OS X.\n\nWhilst I can use a `repr` of `i32`, I'd rather not. Whilst in this particular case it's very highly unlikely that the definition of `c_int` will every change or vary across platforms (16-bit rust, anyone), one loses expressiveness and introduces a little more need to understand what's going on - limiting the usefulness of a type alias...\n\nI've raised this as an issue, not a RFC or anything like that (a) because I'm new to all of this and (b) because what I just did was what I thought would be logical - it's the very first time I tried to use repr, and it didn't work as seemed obvious. Obviously if there's a better forum I'll move this.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33432/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33432/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
