It seems that implicit borrows sometimes seem to get overlooked in the borrow checker.  This seems like a kind of bad bug, though it's exact scope is unclear until we investigate a bit more. \r\n\r\nHere is a variant of @jorendorf's example which is pretty clearly wrong. Here, the `block` variable is mutably borrowed into `x`, so it should not be accessible via `let p`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#![allow(dead_code)]\r\npub struct Block<'a> {\r\n    current: &'a u8,\r\n    unrelated: &'a u8,\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn bump<'a>(mut block: &mut Block<'a>) {\r\n    let x = &mut block;\r\n    let p: &'a u8 = &*block.current;\r\n\t// (use `x` and `p` so enabling NLL doesn't assign overly short lifetimes)\r\n\tdrop(x);\r\n\tdrop(p);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that the problem has to do with the logic around borrowing the referent of an `&T` (in this case, we are borrowing `*block.current`). In particular, we deem that to be \"safe\" for the scope of `'a` because the data is independently guaranteed to be valid that long (this is reasonable). But we still need to validate that `block.current` can be (instantaneously) read. It seems we are not doing that. But this is all a hypothesis: I've not dug into the code to validate it.\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38899/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38899/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
