The fact that we don't do this costs us one extra word of worst-case glue-call args at the moment (7 words instead of the 6 we'd need otherwise).\n\nThis is a relatively minor issue, but now noted.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/158/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/158/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
