If it\r\n  were, that would hint that it cannot have any side-effects, or that it cannot\r\n  do anything that `const fn`s cannot do. \r\n\r\n- [ ] Naming: during the RFC discussion it was unclear whether `black_box` is the\r\n  right name for this primitive but we settled on `bench_black_box` for the time\r\n  being. We should resolve the naming before stabilization.\r\n  \r\n  Also, we might want to add other benchmarking hints in the future, like\r\n  `bench_input` and `bench_output`, so we might want to put all of this\r\n  into a `bench` sub-module within the `core::hint` module. That might\r\n  be a good place to explain how the benchmarking hints should be used \r\n  holistically.\r\n  \r\n  Some arguments in favor or against using \"black box\" are that:\r\n     * pro: [black box] is a common term in computer programming, that conveys\r\n       that nothing can be assumed about it except for its inputs and outputs.\r\n       con: [black box] often hints that the function has no side-effects, but\r\n       this is not something that can be assumed about this API.\r\n     * con: `_box` has nothing to do with `Box` or `box`-syntax, which might be confusing\r\n \r\n  Alternative names suggested: `pessimize`, `unoptimize`, `unprocessed`, `unknown`,\r\n  `do_not_optimize` (Google Benchmark).\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Dylan-DPC", "id": 99973273, "node_id": "U_kgDOBfV4mQ", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99973273?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC", "html_url": "https://github.com/Dylan-DPC", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/64102/reactions", "total_count": 19, "+1": 17, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/64102/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
