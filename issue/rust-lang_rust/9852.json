But if we ever expand our constant expressions in the future to include mutation, allowing people to omit them here might present a backwards-compat hazard.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "erickt", "id": 84711, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzEx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84711?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/erickt", "html_url": "https://github.com/erickt", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erickt/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erickt/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erickt/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erickt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erickt/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erickt/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erickt/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erickt/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erickt/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9852/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9852/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
