Typically this is a PR\r\nimplementing a feature, followed by a PR that stabilises the feature. However\r\nfor larger features an implementation could be broken up into multiple PRs.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Merge Implementation (cc @rust-lang/T-libs, cc @RalfJung)\r\n- [ ] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][doc-guide])\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][stabilization-guide])\r\n\r\n[stabilization-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr\r\n[doc-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#documentation-prs\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n- Currently, there is no unchecked non-null version for raw pointers without pointer casts. Either we want `as_uninit_ref_unchecked` or `Option::unwrap_unchecked`\r\n- Should these operations on `NonNull` take `self`, `&self`, `&mut self`?
