"Windows 7 x64, with rust msvc compiled at 0172e463b0f0c720069d96602209f77c50380066 as well as rustc 1.15.0-nightly (ba872f270 2016-11-17)\r\n\r\nIt seems a bin/lib crate that depends on a lib crate that in turn depends on a proc macro crate doesn't compile because rustc complains that the proc macro crate was compiled as a dylib.\r\n\r\nI have a proc macro crate `foo`, a lib crate `bar` that depends on `foo`, and a bin crate `baz` that depends on `bar`. `bar` compiles fine and generates `libbar.rlib`, but `baz` fails to compile with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror[E0462]: found staticlib `foo`

`baz/`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn Linux, since only a .so is generated (no .lib equivalent), the error is different but the cause is presumably the same.\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror[E0463]: can't find crate for
