One complication is that `pow` is subject to overflow checks: Whether it panics or returns 0 for excessive exponents depends on whether overflow checks are enabled, and I don't know of a way to branch depending on whether they are enabled (which is required for this optimization to not change behavior).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, better LLVM optimizations could help, but this might be a bit too much to ask.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47234/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47234/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
