Historically this was invoked from `make`, and implementing that script in `make` would be a nightmare!\r\n\r\nNowadays we've got rustbuild, a build system in Rust, so let's keep leveraging it! This script is called from [one location](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/036983201d4e9aeb5c5e56e47c305971972b2569/src/bootstrap/dist.rs#L114-L125) and should be relatively easy rewrite it directly inline. The Rust standard library should have all the tools needed to implement this script.\r\n\r\nI'm tagging this as E-easy and E-mentor, please reach out to me if you'd like to take this on and need assistance!", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/41568/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/41568/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
