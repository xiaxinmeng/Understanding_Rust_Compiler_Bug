It can avoid lots of heap allocations when used on hot paths, which can give nice speed-ups. I have used it in multiple places, and I have more changes in the pipeline that will use it.\n\nBut it's not quite as general-purpose as it could be. Ideas for improvement:\n- Rename it as `SmallVec`, to mirror `Vec`.\n- Move it from libsyntax to librustc_data_structures.\n- Increase the number of elements that can be present without requiring heap allocation from 1 to 2 or 4. (Because 1 covers a lot of cases, but 2 or 4 would cover more.)\n- Tweak the API to better match `Vec`. E.g. change `zero()` to `new()`.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37371/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37371/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
