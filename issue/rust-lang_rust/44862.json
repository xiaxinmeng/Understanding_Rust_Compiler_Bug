I am trying to split it into a few crates internally, to logically decompose it, and speed up compilation. I would like to end up producing a dylib with no runtime dependencies on the system (as I do when just building one crate).\r\n\r\nIf I decompose into sub-crates and don't add a [workspace] section to my Cargo.toml, my top-level dylib is produced as I expect. It has no dynamic dependency on libstd listed when I run `otool -L` on my Mac. However, `cargo test --all` doesn't pick up the sub-crate tests.\r\n\r\nIf I add a [workspace] section to my Cargo.toml, `cargo test --all` picks up the sub-crate tests, but my top-level dylib now has a dynamic dependency on libstd.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, there doesn't appear to be a way to both have `--all` work, and not pick up a runtime dependency on a dylib which I'd like to avoid.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following is the bug, I'm not sure:\r\n 1. `cargo test --all` doesn't pick up non-workspace sub-crates\r\n 2. `cargo build` produces different linkage configuration depending on whether you're in a workspace\r\nbut it seems wrong that there's no way to get the best of both behaviours.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44862/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44862/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
