My hope was to use it to make recursive closures. While implementing it, I triggered a compiler stack overflow which can be reproduced with this small example code:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Helper<'a,F:'a>(&'a F);\n\nfn fix<F>(f: F) -> i32\n  where F: Fn(Helper<F>, i32) -> i32      \n{\n  f(Helper(&f), 8) \n}\n\nfn main() {  \n  fix(|_,x| x);  \n}\n```\n\nThis was on \"rustc 1.0.0-beta (9854143cb 2015-04-02) (built 2015-04-02)\", but it still happens on nightly.\n\nI've seen there are a couple other stack overflow bugs related to recursive types. The examples I saw, however, were situations where the compiler should have just given a nicer error message. In my case, I think this is a legitimate piece of code that should compile.\n\nThis is analagous to the SML datatype 'a t = T of  'a t -> 'a\n\nRust should be able to do this, too.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25439/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25439/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
