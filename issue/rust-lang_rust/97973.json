Specifically, we have a `GENESIS_TIMESTAMP` const in a blockchain we're building, but as the chain hasn't been launched we cannot define this const right now. We can't run the risk of adding a dummy value, and it is a pain to comment it out because there is some code that relies on it. I suppose the latter is the best solution, though.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm not sure if something like <title> is currently possible, but it would be a neat extension of the concept of `unimplemented!()`.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror[E0080]: evaluation of constant value failed\r\n  --> src/consensus/difficulty.rs:13:43\r\n   |\r\n13 | const GENESIS_TIMESTAMP: BlockTimestamp = unimplemented!(); // TODO\r\n   |                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the evaluated program panicked at 'not implemented', src/consensus/difficulty.rs:13:43\r\n   |\r\n   = note: this error originates in the macro `unimplemented` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)\r\n```", "closed_by": {"login": "mrcnski", "id": 6035856, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzU4NTY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6035856?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrcnski", "html_url": "https://github.com/mrcnski", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrcnski/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrcnski/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrcnski/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrcnski/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrcnski/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrcnski/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrcnski/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrcnski/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrcnski/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97973/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97973/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
