The reason is that they don't have their own page. Something that was suggested was to group items that \"couldn't be implementated using `impl block`\" into their own page (like constants, statics, non-inlined re-exports, etc). So all constants would into a same `constants.html` page. But that would be for later since it'd change URLs, requiring an RFC.\r\n\r\nThe motivation behind this is to allow all items into the documentation to have the same behaviour: on the module page, short documentation. On their \"own\" (grouped) page, full documentation.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @rust-lang/rustdoc?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/112379/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/112379/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
