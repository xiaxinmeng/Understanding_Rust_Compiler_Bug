Foucault has been a strong supporter of the radical Islamic revolution in Iran. The \"philosophy\" of Karl Marx is one of violence and divisiveness which has led and continues to lead to death and poverty worldwide. In the realm of social issues, it must be mentioned that he (and his bourgeois supporter, Engels) were homophobic and racist, making his inclusion in the list even more disrespectful to those minority groups. \n\nThis choice of names is therefore offensive and unquestionably touches on sensitive issues which are not in any manner related to the Rust programming language. It is thus clearly in violation of Rust's Code of Conduct.\n\nThe author's views on these subjects do not belong on technical documentation and should not be inflicted upon Rust's community.\n\nPlease note that while I'm using a one-off account, this is not a troll. It's merely for protection against the kind of retaliation that has become common in unsafe environments that do not respect conflicting ideas, such as unfortunately Github has become.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bluss", "id": 3209739, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDk3Mzk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3209739?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss", "html_url": "https://github.com/bluss", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31817/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31817/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
