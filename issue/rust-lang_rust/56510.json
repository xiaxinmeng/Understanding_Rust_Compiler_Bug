For us libstd doesn't depend on gdi32.dll directly but it does depend on shell32.dll which depends on gdi32.dll (according to the blog post). Specificaly it looks like `CommandLineToArgvW`, the same function as LLVM, is used by us! \r\n\r\nIt'd be great to investigate removing the shell32 dependency from libstd (may be a few other functions here and there). We should run some tests on Windows to see if this improves rustc cycle times!", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56510/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 3, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56510/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
