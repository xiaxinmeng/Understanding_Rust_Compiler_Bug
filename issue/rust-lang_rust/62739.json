It's not clear exactly the extent of what's wrong, but here are some issues I see:\r\n\r\n- I can't find anything that actually runs the rustc-guide tests.\r\n- Running them locally, they fail with bad links.\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: there are broken links\r\n\tCaused By: \"https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/experts/MAP.md\" returned 404 Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Note, this is especially awkward for me to deal with, because it only runs on linux, which is not my native platform.\r\n- The rustc-guide entry was never added to [toolstate](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-toolstate/blob/master/_data/latest.json).\r\n\r\nI'll also note that I am concerned that running external link checks on CI will likely be unreliable, and I do not want PRs to be blocked because of it. \r\n\r\ncc @mark-i-m \r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "ehuss", "id": 43198, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTk4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43198?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss", "html_url": "https://github.com/ehuss", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62739/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62739/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
