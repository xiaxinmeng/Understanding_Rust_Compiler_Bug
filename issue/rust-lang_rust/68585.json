Examples of this includes:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// from `src/test/ui/conflicting-repr-hints.rs\r\n\r\n#[repr(u32, u64)] //~ ERROR conflicting representation hints\r\nenum D {\r\n    D,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe are presently issuing a deny-by-default lint when conflicting representation hints are used together but we expect to transition the lint to hard **errors** in the future.\r\n\r\n### How can you fix your code?\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the conflict should be fixed by more clearly expressing your intent so that the conflict is resolved.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/68585/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/68585/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
