This lead to us attempting to generate the following code:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub struct bool;\r\n\r\nimpl QueryId for bool {\r\n    type QueryId = Self;\r\n    const HAS_STATIC_QUERY_ID: bool = true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich causes a type mismatch because their struct is shadowing the primitive. I'd like to change the generated code to be `const HAS_STATIC_QUERY_ID: ::std::bool`, which is the path that the rustdoc for libstd indicates it should be, but the type doesn't exist there, or anywhere else I can find. I would assume the same issue exists for `str`, `char`, and all the numeric types.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44865/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 3, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44865/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
