Consider the [foreign impls](https://docs.rs/tokio/0.1.12/tokio/prelude/trait.Stream.html#foreign-impls) for the `Stream` trait from `tokio`. The first impl header is `#impl-Stream`, the second impl header is `#impl-Stream-1`, the third impl header is `#impl-Stream-2`, and so on.\r\n\r\nBut, the links in the sidebar do not jump to these specific IDs. Instead, they all link to `#impl-Stream`, or the first impl in the list. For a trait like `Stream`, which has many methods and many foreign implementors, this makes it difficult to get to a specific impl (to see the associated types, for example). You have to search the page, collapse the sections, or just scroll.\r\n\r\nSince unique IDs are already generated for the impl sections, it would be great if the sidebar items used them to make navigation easier.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56018/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56018/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
