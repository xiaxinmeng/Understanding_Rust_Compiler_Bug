That is, `a.cmp(b) == Ordering::Equal` if and only if `a == b` [\u2026] It's easy to accidentally make them disagree.\r\n\r\nSo, if it's easy to make them disagree, why not make `Eq` automatically implemented when someone defines `Ord`? It would be as simple as `ordering == Eq`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the documentation doesn't explain *why* something must implement `Eq` for it to be `Ord`, which could be helpful for people to understand it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is how I think it should work:\r\n* If something implements `Ord`, it's obvious that it is `Eq`, `PartialOrd` and `PartialEq`.\r\n* If something is `PartialOrd`, it's obvious that it is `PartialEq`.\r\n* If it's neither of those, one can always implement the largest amount that can be implemented.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA friend just shared [Why does Eq require PartialEq?
