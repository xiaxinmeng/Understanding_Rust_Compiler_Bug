One easy way to change this would be to add --min_iters and --max_secs command line arguments to allow for controlling these two parameters (as well as corresponding arguments in 'cargo bench').\r\n\r\nI noticed #50297 but wasn't sure if this sort of functionality would be included in the implementation of that RFC or if it could be implemented independent of it.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55456/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55456/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
