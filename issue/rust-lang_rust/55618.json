I further propose we backport this stabilization to version 1.31 beta, so that all stable versions of Rust 2018 have this feature.\r\n\r\nWe've taken informal polls about this question [in a paper document][paper]. Most of the lang team has favored uniform_paths, I and @cramertj were the only two members who initially favored anchored_paths. Yesterday, we discussed this in the lang team video meeting; in the meeting we sort of crystallized the various pros and cons of the two variants, but didn't reach a consensus.\r\n\r\nIn the time since the meeting, I've come around to thinking that stabilizing on uniform_paths is probably the best choice. I imagine @cramertj has not changed his mind, and though he said in the meeting he wouldn't block a decision, I hope we can use this FCP period to see if there's any agreeable changes that would make uniform_paths more palatable to him.\r\n\r\nI've also written [a blog post][blog] summarizing the meeting discussion and how my position has evolved, which provides more context on this decision.\r\n\r\nI also want to make sure we continue to get community feedback as we reach this final decision! Please contribute new thoughts you have to the discussion. However, we will hopefully make this decision within the next few weeks, and certain proposals are out of scope. Any third proposal which is not completely backwards compatible with the current behavior of paths in Rust 2018 is impossible to ship in Rust 2018 at this point. Variations on anchored or uniform paths that *are* backwards compatible may be considered, but that also seems unlikely.\r\n\r\n[paper]: https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Lang-team-stance-on-modules-cvcNJv9qnNUeWXMcvLGzs\r\n[blog]: https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/anchored-uniform/", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55618/reactions", "total_count": 19, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 9, "confused": 0, "heart": 10, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55618/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
