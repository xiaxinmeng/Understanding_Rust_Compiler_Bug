When compiling crates, I often see this crate holding up the overall process, and because others are depending on it, it grabs one cpu core and the others are literally idle and I need to wait.\r\n\r\n> Yeah this contains some giant match statements which are slow. We could perhaps use something like phf_map here but that may not improve compile times.\r\n\r\n-- @Manishearth\r\n\r\nI'd be thankful if there are some efforts to make it faster. :)\r\n\r\nref https://github.com/unicode-rs/unicode-normalization/issues/29", "closed_by": {"login": "nnethercote", "id": 1940286, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDAyODY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1940286?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nnethercote", "html_url": "https://github.com/nnethercote", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nnethercote/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nnethercote/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nnethercote/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nnethercote/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nnethercote/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nnethercote/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nnethercote/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nnethercote/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nnethercote/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55528/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55528/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
