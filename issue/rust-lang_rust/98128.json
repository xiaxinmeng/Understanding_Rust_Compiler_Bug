It would be nice if the compiler would give a suggestion to replace `=>` with `>=`. In my opinion, this would help a lot for someone typing quickly, and would make it clear that the symbols were in reverse. It might also lead to some false positives, but I think it would still be nice to have.\r\n\r\nThe error is actually worse for macros:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nmacro_rules! accept_expr {\r\n    ( $expr:expr ) => { $expr }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    accept_expr!(5 => 3);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current output for this macro is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)\r\nerror: no rules expected the token `=>`\r\n --> src/main.rs:6:20\r\n  |\r\n1 | macro_rules! accept_expr {\r\n  | ------------------------ when calling this macro\r\n...\r\n6 |     accept_expr!(5 => 3);\r\n  |                    ^^ no rules expected this token in macro call\r\n\r\nerror: could not compile `playground` due to previous error\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy suggestion it to simply add a `help` section to both of the above errors, which would suggest replacing the `=>` token with `>=`.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/98128/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/98128/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
