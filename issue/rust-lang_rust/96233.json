I have a code generator, which creates rust code for build scripts. There is a function to generate a comment, and part of the documentation is the resulting comment. Using ```text would solve the warning, but it would not be highlighted as a comment in the resulting webpage. As far as I can tell, this doesn't seem like an empty code block, and I don't think this lint should trigger over it.\r\n\r\nUsing stable and switching editions doesn't change the output.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to a sample repository: [https://github.com/macmv/rustdoc-empty-code-block-sample](https://github.com/macmv/rustdoc-empty-code-block-sample)", "closed_by": {"login": "macmv", "id": 14830829, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODMwODI5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14830829?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/macmv", "html_url": "https://github.com/macmv", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/macmv/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/macmv/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/macmv/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/macmv/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/macmv/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/macmv/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/macmv/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/macmv/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/macmv/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/96233/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/96233/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
