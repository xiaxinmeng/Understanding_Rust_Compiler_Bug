But from the user's perspective there is no such parameter, and the suggestion to remove it is nonsense. The error message should be adjusted to recognize when it's complaining about `Self` and to explain itself better.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "lilyball", "id": 714, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/714?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball", "html_url": "https://github.com/lilyball", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24131/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24131/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
