Went to Rust homepage, clicked on beta [API docs](http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0-beta/std/).\n2. In the search bar, typed in `str`.\n3. Clicked on first result, `std::str`.\n4. Found no methods for `str`. Only structs are available, no stable traits that might have the methods.\n5. Randomly clicked on [`Chars` struct](http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0-beta/std/str/struct.Chars.html). Page says \"Created with the method .chars().\"\n6. Typed `chars` into the search box. Lots of results, found a method `core::str::StrExt::chars`. Saw that `StrExt` was unstable, and I only want stable APIs so closed the tab.\n7. Clicked around some more, gave up, asked on `#rust` IRC about `str` methods.\n8. Was given link to [Primitive type str](http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0-beta/std/primitive.str.html).\n\nHopefully we'll have a better experience for the flood of newcomers at 1.0.\n\n@steveklabnik \n", "closed_by": {"login": "emberian", "id": 704250, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDI1MA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/704250?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian", "html_url": "https://github.com/emberian", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24097/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24097/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
