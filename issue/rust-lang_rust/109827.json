this error comes from remarking out the trait bound on line 32 as above. That bound is meant to close the type association loop so that `<SpotId as EnumArray>::Array` is always `Sync`, which works as long as `process()` is not defined. A similarly long error still appears if both are left in. (I added the `process()` function to show an error that does elide part of the type.) \r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n[playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=ca3b40d43c8b2511facf799d6e374fbc)\r\n\r\nMy original error message on stable spelled out both `std::option::Option` and `world::Accessible`, so it was longer as well.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/109827/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/109827/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
