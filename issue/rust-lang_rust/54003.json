This means that no MIR is generated. The unsafe checker runs on MIR.\r\n\r\nBut I think that we expect an error here nonetheless.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression that was introduced in the move to doing unsafe checking on MIR. I'm not sure the best way to fix: I tend to think we should do unsafe checking on HAIR, but that would be a fairly large effort.  We could certainly generate a \"dummy access\" as we do with matches.  (But we want to be careful about borrow checker interactions -- see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53114).\r\n\r\nI'm nominating this for lang-team discussion \u2014\u00a0we *do* want an unsafe error here, right?\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54003/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54003/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
