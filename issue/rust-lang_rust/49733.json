Can we just describe it as \"will never be stabilised in its current form as it's an internal implementation detail, may be stabilised under a new design of placement\")?\r\n     - if it *were* possible to remove it as a language feature, is it reasonable to do so without a replacement in the form of working placement?\r\n     - if we want to keep box syntax internally, should we rename (but keep reserved) the keyword to something else to deliberately break users and indicate it shouldn't be used for placement?\r\n   - is there any reason for users to use box syntax (apart from it looking nice) given `Box::new` [is inline always](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/83669ec/src/liballoc/boxed.rs#L92-L95), or does that [not work](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/49646#issuecomment-379219615)?\r\n - if we decide to keep this, there are a number of unresolved questions in #22181 about the syntax behaviour\r\n\r\nNote: when removing this, be careful not to remove the syntax entirely in order to not cause another case of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50832", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/49733/reactions", "total_count": 54, "+1": 36, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 10, "confused": 8, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/49733/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
