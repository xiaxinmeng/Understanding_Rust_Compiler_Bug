The reason is that `by_val`, having a non-immediate type, is really passed by reference as far as LLVM is concerned (see `trans::base::copy_args_to_allocas()`). The `ty::t` associated with the value, however, is still the non-pointer type. LLVM does not seem to like this during codegen and silently omits the debug info entry for the parameter (see `CompileUnit::constructVariableDIE()` in `llvm/lib/CodeGen/AsmPrinter/DwarfCompileUnit.cpp`). Consequently, GDB won't find anything for the name `by_val`.\n\nA fix will probably involve `DIBuilder::createComplexVariable()`.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8512/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8512/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
