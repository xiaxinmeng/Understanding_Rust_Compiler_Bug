In particular I have tried replacing\n\n``` bash\nprintf \"%-20s := %s\\n\" $1 \"$T\" >>config.tmp\n```\n\nin `putvar` function with\n\n``` bash\nprintf \"%-20s := %q\\n\" $1 \"$T\" >>config.tmp\n```\n\nAs the result, `config.tmp` contained properly escaped paths, but the following code at the end of `configure` script\n\n``` bash\n# Munge any paths that appear in config.mk back to posix-y\nperl -i.bak -p -e 's@ ([a-zA-Z]):[/\\\\]@ /\\1/@go;' \\\n               -e 's@\\\\@/@go;' config.tmp \n```\n\nReplaced all backslashes to forward slashes thus ruining the paths again.\n\nAt this point I am stuck. My next try will be disabling this transformation but I am not sure whether it is safe or not. It works for me, but I would very much like to resolve this problem once and for all. I am willing to work on this and submit merge request afterwards but at this point any guidance will be appreciated.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "vharavy", "id": 4202877, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDI4Nzc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4202877?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vharavy", "html_url": "https://github.com/vharavy", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vharavy/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vharavy/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vharavy/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vharavy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vharavy/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vharavy/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vharavy/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vharavy/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vharavy/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18632/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18632/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
