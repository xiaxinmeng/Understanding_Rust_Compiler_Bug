In theory, a stateful error with a `Cell` or a `RefCell` is a possible example of `dyn Error + Send + !Sync`.\r\n\r\nThe second impl is mainly for coherence and symmetry, I still do not have in mind a possible realistic situation.\r\n\r\nIn any case, IMHO this feature should not require a RFC. In that case I can create a PR and follow these steps:\r\n- [ ] Implement the two impls\r\n- [ ] Adjust the docs\r\n\r\nIt is the first time I contribute to Rust, and I am not sure if this feature should require a stabilization process. In this case just let me know, and I will update this document in order to include the addition of a feature gate and everything needed.\r\n\r\nAny feedback is appreciated to make me do things nicely and your review less painful.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62824/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62824/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
