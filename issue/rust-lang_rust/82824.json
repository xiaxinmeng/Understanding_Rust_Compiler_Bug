There are probably other similar attributes that should become hard errors, so please comment if you know of more.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we need to wait to do this in the 2021 Edition since these attributes are likely not used at all, but I'm tagging this issue as `lang-team-202x-edition` and will note this in the `#edition 2021` Zulip stream in case it has to happen across an edition boundary.\r\n\r\ncc #82651, #44136\r\ncc @rust-lang/rustdoc ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82824/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82824/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
