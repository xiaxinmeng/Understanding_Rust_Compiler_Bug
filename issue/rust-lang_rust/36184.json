Presumably, the compiler could give a clearer error message in this situation, although I'm not sure what the best way to handle it is \u2013 it would obviously be bad to give the full path for every trait mentioned in an error message. Maybe it should give the full path exactly when there are two traits (or other objects) with the same name?\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36184/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36184/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
