For lifetimes, I would expect that `'a` is a \"subtype\" of `'b` if `'a` is a _larger_ scope than `'b`. That would mean that `'static` is a subtype of any lifetime -- so if I have a `&'static T` I can use it wherever `&'a T` is expected.\n\nBy that logic, if `'a` is a larger lifetime than `'b` and `Foo` is covariant, we should have `Foo<'a>` is a subtype of `Foo<'b>`, and the opposite if `Foo` is contravariant.  These notions of variance line up correctly with Rust's closure types, which follow [the typical rules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_%28computer_science%29#Function_types):\n- The result position is _covariant_, so that `|T| -> &'static U` is usable wherever `|T| -> &'a U` is expected.\n- The argument position is _contravariant_, so that `|&'a T| -> U` is usable wherever `|&'static T| -> U` is expected.\n\nBut the `CovariantLifetime` and `ContravariantLifetime` markers seem to work backwards from everything described above. In particular, function arguments are treated as if they had the _co_variant marker, which is very surprising:\n\n**Update** After discussion with @zwarich below, I think the real culprit here is that `&` takes its lifetime contravariantly, while it takes its type covariantly. I don't understand the rationale behind this choice. As I argue above, I think lifetime subtyping should be reverse region inclusion, which would mean `&` is _co_variant.\n\n``` rust\nuse std::kinds::marker::{CovariantLifetime, ContravariantLifetime};\n\n// A straight-up reference:     'static => 'a\nfn test_ref<'a>(t: &'static u8) -> &'a u8 {\n    t\n}\n\n// Reference in a struct:       'static => 'a\nstruct Foo<'a> {\n    t: &'a u8\n}\nfn test_struct<'a>(f: Foo<'static>) -> Foo<'a> {\n    f\n}\n\n// fn with arg:                 'a => 'static\nfn test_fn_in<'a, 'b>(f: |&'a u8|: 'b) -> |&'static u8|: 'b {\n    f\n}\n// fn with result:              'static => 'a\nfn test_fn_out<'a, 'b>(f: ||: 'b -> &'static u8) -> (||: 'b -> &'a u8) {\n    f\n}\n\n// Covariant struct:            'a => 'static\nstruct FooCo<'a> {\n    marker: CovariantLifetime<'a>\n}\nfn test_co<'a>(f: FooCo<'a>) -> FooCo<'static> {\n    f\n}\n\n// Contravariant struct:        'static => 'a\nstruct FooContra<'a> {\n    marker: ContravariantLifetime<'a>\n}\nfn test_contra<'a>(f: FooContra<'static>) -> FooContra<'a> {\n    f\n}\n```\n\ncc @nikomatsakis @pnkfelix @pcwalton \n\nNominating.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "aturon", "id": 709807, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTgwNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/709807?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon", "html_url": "https://github.com/aturon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15699/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15699/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
