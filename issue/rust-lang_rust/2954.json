Then you'll never need to type \"builder\" - all of these will be valid:\n\n```\ndo task::spawn { ... }\ndo task::unlinked().notify_chan(c).spawn { ... }\ndo task::notify_chan(c).unlinked().spawn { ... }\nlet t = task::unlinked();\ndo t.spawn { ... }\ndo t.notify_chan(c).spawn { ... }\n```\n\nOne problem is noncopyability of certain things that might get put in builder - like wrappers and notify ports (or future stuff...? not entirely clear on that).\n\nMove mode on self can solve that; until then, we could perhaps make it a runtime error by doing the standard option dance. (When move mode on self appears, we can make it a build error without changing the interface.)\n\n```\ntype builder = ~mut option<{...record...}>\nimpl for builder {\n    fn set_noncopyable_thing() -> builder {\n        let mut result = none;\n        result <-> *self;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAn attempt to use a builder with `none` in it would fail at runtime.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bblum", "id": 1820515, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjA1MTU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1820515?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum", "html_url": "https://github.com/bblum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2954/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2954/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
