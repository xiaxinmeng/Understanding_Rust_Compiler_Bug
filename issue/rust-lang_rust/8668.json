We have Servo as a motivating application, and there is a solid academic background and some web programming expertise around, which is great. But we do not have game development expertise around, and that seems to be a demographic very interested in Rust. \n\nThis article was mentioned by \"nawfel\" in #rust this morning and I think is a great piece to help us figure this sort of thing out. I haven't read the full article, but it describes a concurrency library in use today and gives motivating examples and discusses design decisions. There are also links to more relevant articles.\n\nhttp://gameangst.com/?p=526\n\nThe \"actual issue\" here in the short term is to start finding sources like this and getting more concrete wants out of the demographic so we can start thinking about them in the context of the Rust runtime.\n\nThis is tagged as a metabug, so we can start collecting issues here. Currently there are no issues to link though.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8668/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8668/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
