I brought it up to the IRC channel and been given this link:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/DanielKeep/470f4e114d28cd0c8d43\n\nI think that the highlights given in that gist should be part of the crates & modules section of the guide. Having a background in C++, Python and other similar languages, after a readout of that section, I still had many misunderstanding about how modules work in Rust.\n\nOne of the main point of my misunderstanding was that I was using `mod a;` as I would have been using `import a;` in language such as D and Python. Also, distinguishing between the use paths and the non-use paths is something that I think should be emphasized in the Guide. \n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18071/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18071/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
