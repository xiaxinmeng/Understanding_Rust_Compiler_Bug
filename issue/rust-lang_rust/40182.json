What was confusing to me is that I did not realize where the `Send` bound was coming from, so I spent a bunch of time spinning my wheels on it.\r\n\r\nHere's a simpler set of code that produces the same error:\r\nhttps://is.gd/Gl1Zon\r\n\r\nThe error is also much simpler when you don't have complicated type signatures involving `Future`, but that's just par for the course.", "closed_by": {"login": "cjgillot", "id": 1822483, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjI0ODM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1822483?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjgillot", "html_url": "https://github.com/cjgillot", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjgillot/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjgillot/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjgillot/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjgillot/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjgillot/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjgillot/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjgillot/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjgillot/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjgillot/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40182/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40182/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
