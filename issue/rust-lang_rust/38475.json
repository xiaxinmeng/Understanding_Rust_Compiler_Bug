Of course I screwed up the conversion when I wrote that code, thankfully someone sent me a PR to fix it:\r\nhttps://github.com/mozilla/sccache/pull/52\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if this was a built-in API. Ideally we'd have `pub fn as_fractional_secs(&self) -> f64`, but maybe that'd lose too much precision? I suppose we could alternately do something like `pub fn as_fractional_secs(&self) -> (u64, f32)`, where it returns `(self.as_secs(), self.subsec_nanos() as f32 / 1000_000f32)`. That's a bit less ergonomic, but not awful.\r\n\r\nAlternately, since it's already easy to do arithmetic on `Duration`s, another take on this would be to implement `Display` for `Duration`, which could write the value as seconds, and support the floating-point precision format field for fractional seconds.", "closed_by": {"login": "dtolnay", "id": 1940490, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDA0OTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1940490?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay", "html_url": "https://github.com/dtolnay", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38475/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38475/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
