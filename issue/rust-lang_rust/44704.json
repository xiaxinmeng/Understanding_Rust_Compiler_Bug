The Book second edition uses a custom template in order to display the \"this is a draft\" banner, and so, we updated it to include the new file https://github.com/rust-lang/book/pull/783. However, this was wrong; it shouldn't have been done until `mdbook` was updated in the main repository. As such, things are now very broken:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"775\" alt=\"book\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27786/30607860-81f0bf1c-9d44-11e7-8357-720cfaca6e79.png\">\r\n\r\nAs nightly has updated `mdbook`, this has been fixed, but having the main way of learning Rust broken for ~10 weeks isn't great.\r\n\r\n### For stable\r\n\r\nWe could fix the online docs by just uploading `store.js` to the appropriate place. I am normally very against changing what we distribute after the fact, but simply adding a file seems very minimal.\r\n\r\nWhile this regression is in some sense very serious, I don't think it's worth cutting a new stable for, with this workaround.\r\n\r\n### For beta\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, we should send in a backport fix to beta. This involves upgrading mdbook on beta.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nTagging as \"regression from stable to nightly\" even though it's been fixed in nightly; this is about what to do for stable and beta. Tagging @rust-lang/infra for the stable fix, tagging @rust-lang/docs for the beta fix.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44704/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44704/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
