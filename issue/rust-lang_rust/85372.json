Those need a `[+]` to open them.\r\n - The user might close all sections with the \"collapse all docs\" button. Those need a `[+]` to open them.\r\n \r\nNote that these all involve the `[+]`, not the `[-]`. But we show lots of `[-]` all over the page, which is visually distracting. In theory these allow users to collapse a single section at a time, but I don't think that's very useful.\r\n \r\nI propose that we make `[-]` invisible. With one exception: If someone has opened a section with `[+]`, it would be confusing and frustrating to not be able to close that section again. So, when someone clicks a `[+]`, we would added a \"perma-visible\" class to that `<summary>` tag, which would cause the `[-]` to be visible.\r\n\r\ncc @GuillaumeGomez", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85372/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85372/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
