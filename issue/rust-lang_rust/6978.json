We can still provide adaptors for composing internal iterators (`iter.rs`) but there's no need to provide internal iterators ourselves side-by-side with external iterators.\n\nI think we should throw out the dozens of internal iterators we have on `str` and `vec` since they already have a mutable and immutable external iterator. We just need iterators for reverse traversal and the internal ones will be entirely redundant.\n\nFor example, there's no need for hardcoded internal iterators like `each2` when we have `xs.zip(ys)` for any two _arbitrary_ iterators - not just two vectors.\n\nSee: https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-June/004364.html\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6978/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6978/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
