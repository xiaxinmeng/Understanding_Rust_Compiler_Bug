U+002D looks bad in that context; U+2212 is more suitable and looks better in mathematical expressions.\r\n\r\nNote: I had already opened PR #90777 to fix this, but it was closed. I opened the issue to discuss this here instead of in an already-closed PR. The [reason given for closing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/90777#issuecomment-965898080) is:\r\n\r\n>In Rust, negative numbers are expressed using U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, and our documentation should be consistent with Rust code, rather than using a confusingly similar symbol.\r\n\r\nBut I don't agree with that: here the minus sign is in a mathematical expression that is not code. If it were an expression in verbatim code then yes, U+002D would be better, but for example \u22122<sup>31</sup> cannot be written in code anyway (the code `-2i32.pow(31)` wouldn't even work).\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18604588/141269136-2872a2ea-b794-4ea0-b717-1742df07fa97.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18604588/141269228-e21cb218-cfd7-4c9b-99b8-ad197842d807.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18604588/141269574-e507ed52-f4a9-4ca1-af4e-c2f1634954f1.png)\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90793/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90793/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
