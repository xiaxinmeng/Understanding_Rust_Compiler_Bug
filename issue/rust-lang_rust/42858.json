Is there a specific tool or generator that can generate this document for a given arch?\r\n\r\n2- Once, I have this crate doc in place and have made the necessary changes to lib.rs, would any additional changes be required elsewhere to add support for the new arch?\r\n\r\n3 - Once, support has been added locally, is there a way to test my app (tikv) with the local changes? It seems that re-building and re-installing rust might not be sufficient as libc is fetched at runtime from a registry (https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index?) and the lib.rs that gets installed on the system is quite different from the one that is present in the source code?\r\n\r\nAny pointers on the above queries would be of great help in proceeding with this. Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPriya\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42858/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42858/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
