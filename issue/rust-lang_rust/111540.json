enhancement adds the `--remap-path-scope` command-line flag to control the scoping of how paths get remapped in the resulting binary.\r\n\r\nIssues: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/F-trim-paths\r\nImplementation: TODO\r\nDocumentation: TODO\r\nCargo tracking issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/12137\r\n\r\n### About tracking issues\r\n\r\nTracking issues are used to record the overall progress of implementation.\r\nThey are also used as hubs connecting to other relevant issues, e.g., bugs or open design questions.\r\nA tracking issue is however *not* meant for large scale discussion, questions, or bug reports about a feature.\r\nInstead, open a dedicated issue for the specific matter and add the relevant feature gate label.\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement the RFC (cc @rust-lang/t-compiler -- can anyone write up mentoring instructions?)\r\n- [ ] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][doc-guide])\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][stabilization-guide])\r\n\r\n[stabilization-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr\r\n[doc-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#documentation-prs\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n- [ ] Should we use a slightly more complex remapping rule, like distinguishing packages from registry, git and path, as proposed in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/40552?\r\n- [ ] What concerns are there regarding the use of relative paths causing issues with backtraces and debuggers?\r\n- [ ] Should we treat the current package the same as other packages?\r\n- [ ] Will these cover all potentially embedded paths? Have we missed anything?\r\n\r\n### Implementation history\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a list of all the PRs that were involved in implementing the feature.\r\n-->\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/111540/reactions", "total_count": 22, "+1": 6, "-1": 0, "laugh": 1, "hooray": 13, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/111540/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
