As far as I can tell, this type's public API consists\nof only its implementations of `Debug` and `Display`. Should `Path::display()`\nreturn a generic `impl Debug + Display` instead of allowing users to rely on it\nbeing a particular concrete type?\n\nI think the potential breakage is probably none since you can't do anything with\n`std::path::Display` short of using its `Debug` and `Display` impls. You could\ntheoretically have a function that requires its argument to be of type\n`std::path::Display`, but I don't see why that would be useful. If there are\nsuch functions, they could likely be changed to take `impl Debug + Display`.\n\nRight now, there's not necessarily a reason to do this, but in general we want\nto hide implementation details in case we need to make changes in the future\n(cc #80634).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80676/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80676/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
