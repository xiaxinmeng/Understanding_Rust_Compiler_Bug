However, KaTeX auto-render postprocessing is severely incompatible with markdown due to markdown processing almost any underscores it encounters as italics.\r\n\r\nFor example, the documentation\r\n```rust\r\n/// For an operator $A$ this is an operator $A_*$ such that its adjoint $(A_*)^*=A$. \r\n```\r\ngets converted into the HTML\r\n```html\r\nFor an operator $A$ this is an operator $A_<em>$ such that its adjoint $(A_</em>)^*=A$.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe standard workaround (unreadable-as-text, and will also stop `README.md` sharing with a modern markdown processor that directly supports KaTeX) would be to  to write instead\r\n```rust\r\n/// For an operator $A$ this is an operator <span>$A_*$</span> such that its adjoint <span>$(A_*)^*=A$</span> \r\n```\r\nbecause markdown *should not* process things between HTML tags. This does not work with rustdoc:\r\n```html\r\nFor an operator $A$ this is an operator <span>$A_<em>$</span> such that its adjoint <span>$(A_</em>)^*=A$</span>. \r\n```\r\nSo it seems rustdoc is incorrectly processing input between HTML tags, that standard markdown would ignore.\r\n\r\nThis is on nightly.\r\n\r\nIssue related to : https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/17390, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/16300, and several others begging some form of LaTeX math support.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "notriddle", "id": 1593513, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTM1MTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1593513?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/notriddle", "html_url": "https://github.com/notriddle", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notriddle/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notriddle/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notriddle/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notriddle/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notriddle/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notriddle/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notriddle/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notriddle/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/notriddle/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103473/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103473/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "not_planned"}
