Let's rename `foo` to `foo2` next to the comment \"RENAME HERE\". What happens is that this code has infinite recursion now and `rustc` doesn't report any error nor warning despite the usage of `#![deny(unconditional_recursion)]`. \r\n\r\nThis is a serious problem, as a simple refactoring can cause something like that and it is very, very hard to debug, especially on WASM platform, where infinite recursion can just return a random number (it is UB). This problem could be solvable if I was able to write somehow `MAGIC::Object::foo(self.to_object())` instead of `self.to_object().foo()` but in such a way, that the methods from `ObjectOps` would not be visible in `MAGIC::Object`. Currently, when refactoring such code we can get infinite recursion and spend hours debugging it :(", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/70727/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/70727/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
