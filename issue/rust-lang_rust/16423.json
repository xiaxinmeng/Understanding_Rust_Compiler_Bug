It would be nice to avoid that for types that implement `Default`.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Swatinem", "id": 580492, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDQ5Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/580492?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Swatinem", "html_url": "https://github.com/Swatinem", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Swatinem/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Swatinem/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Swatinem/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Swatinem/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Swatinem/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Swatinem/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Swatinem/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Swatinem/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Swatinem/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16423/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16423/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
