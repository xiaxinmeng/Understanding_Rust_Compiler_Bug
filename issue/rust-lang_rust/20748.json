And now that `CVec` is gone, this is the only way to build a slice from a raw pointer.\n\nI can see many potential problems, but the ones that I've encountered while removing CVec is that you can't cast your pointers, not even from mut to const: (http://is.gd/eW1KmQ)\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo { data: *mut i8, len: uint }\nimpl Foo {\n    fn as_slice(&self) -> &[i8] {\n        unsafe {\n            // value \"self.data as *const i8\" does not live long enough\n            std::slice::from_raw_buf(&(self.data as *const i8), self.len)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd that you can't use raw pointers in iterators anymore: (http://is.gd/UsePsX)\n\n``` rust\nstruct Iter<'a> { data: *const u8, marker: ContravariantLifetime<'a> }\nimpl<'a> Iterator for Iter<'a> {\n    type Item = &'a [u8];\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<&'a [u8]> {\n        Some(unsafe {\n            // cannot infer an appropriate lifetime for borrow expression due to conflicting requirements\n            std::slice::from_raw_buf(&self.data, 1)\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf I'm manipulating raw pointers which are unsafe by nature, please let me be unsafe!\n\nThe first example can be bypassed by using `from_raw_mut_buf` and casting the returned `&mut [i8]` to a `&[i8]`, which means that the unsafe API is more restrictive than the safe API!\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Gankra", "id": 1136864, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjExMzY4NjQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1136864?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra", "html_url": "https://github.com/Gankra", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20748/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20748/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
