It's been the case for quite some time that LLVM is built with ThinLTO on Linux but nowhere else. Differing in linkage is also unfortunate across the major platforms too.\r\n\r\n> I've given up on trying to make link-shared work well across the board -- see PR description and the last few CI failures -- it seems link LLVM is just not ready for a shared link on macOS or when cross-compiling, which excludes almost all of our builders.\r\n\r\nSwitching to static linking would preclude any of the improvements from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76349, so it would be better to use dynamic linking instead which would allow any contributor to get started without building LLVM from source or using system LLVM. That said, it sounds like dynamic linking will be very hard to do on other platforms.\r\n\r\ncc @Mark-Simulacrum", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77084/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77084/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
