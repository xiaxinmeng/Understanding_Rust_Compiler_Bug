Also, which types is rustc even comparing? Where does the `FnOnce` come from?\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The code should compile, with the closure argument type being inferred as `&i32`. In fact, this is what happens as soon as I change the closure definition to\r\n```rust\r\nlet cl = |c: &_| -> () { c % 2; };\r\n```\r\ni.e. by adding a hint that `c` has to be a reference. But this is obvious from `foo`'s signature, isn't it?\r\n\r\nAt least, there should be a less confusing error message.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n<!--\r\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\r\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.49.0 (e1884a8e3 2020-12-29)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: e1884a8e3c3e813aada8254edfa120e85bf5ffca\r\ncommit-date: 2020-12-29\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.49.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n`rustc +nightly --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.51.0-nightly (c97f11af7 2021-01-10)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: c97f11af7bc4a6d3578f6a953be04ab2449a5728\r\ncommit-date: 2021-01-10\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.51.0-nightly\r\n```", "closed_by": {"login": "camelid", "id": 37223377, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjIzMzc3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37223377?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid", "html_url": "https://github.com/camelid", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80915/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80915/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
