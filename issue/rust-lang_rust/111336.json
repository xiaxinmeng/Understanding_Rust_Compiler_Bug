module, which may break downstream uses\n```\n\n\n### Rationale and extra context\n\nSimilar to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/107563\n\nWhereas that issue tackled the case of glob-glob name conflicts, this issue is about glob-vs-local name conflicts in which case the local name shadows the one imported from the glob. This is a footgun and can lead to semver-major breaking changes: uncommenting either line `(1)` or `(2)` in the code example above is a major breaking change for the containing crate, since it causes the name `Foo` to stop being exported and makes `Foo` become an unnamable (Voldemort) type.\n\nThis is not a hypothetical issue. Around a year ago, [the opencl3 crate seems to have suffered a regression](https://github.com/kenba/opencl3/pull/54) when a large number of its items were accidentally shadowed. Neither code review nor tests seem to have been effective at preventing the regression. The fixing PR for that regression [adds a test for the public re-export](https://github.com/kenba/opencl3/pull/54/files#diff-36327182a60f061fcbee1b4da122b99e82b6d4d213e4b3e94bf297354680a720R2178-R2185) of one of the affected items.\n\nThis seems like a perfect situation for a lint. Shadowing a glob-reexported item with a local declaration is pretty much _never_ what you want. If you wanted an unnamable type, there's a better way, and if you didn't want the item to be reexported then tweak the module structure so it doesn't get reexported.\n\nI plan to publish a blog post with more details about this in a few hours, it will be available at the following link: https://predr.ag/blog/breaking-semver-in-rust-by-adding-private-type-or-import/\n\n### Other cases\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"jieyouxu\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/111336/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 5, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/111336/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
