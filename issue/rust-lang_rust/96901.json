Typically this is a PR\nimplementing a feature, followed by a PR that stabilises the feature. However\nfor larger features an implementation could be broken up into multiple PRs.\n-->\n\n- [ ] Implement the RFC (cc @rust-lang/compiler -- can anyone write up mentoring\n      instructions?)\n- [ ] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][doc-guide])\n- [ ] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][stabilization-guide])\n\n[stabilization-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr\n[doc-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#documentation-prs\n\n### Unresolved Questions\n<!--\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\nstabilised.\n-->\n\n- How do we ensure a project does not miss configurations similar to the ones\n  being `#[cfg]`-ed against with this feature? Perhaps this should be added as a\n  Clippy lint that's off by default.\n\n\n### Implementation history\n\n<!--\nInclude a list of all the PRs that were involved in implementing the feature.\n-->\n\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"Urgau\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/96901/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/96901/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
