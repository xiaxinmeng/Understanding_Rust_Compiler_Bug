But there really *isn't* a `[T]::rsplit` method!\r\n\r\nstr            | [T]\r\n-------------  | ------------------\r\n.split(p)      | .split(p)\r\n.rsplit(p)     | *nope*\r\n.splitn(p)     | .splitn(p)\r\n.rsplitn(p)    | .rsplitn(p)\r\n\r\nSlices don't have `.rsplit(p)`, I guess maybe because `.split(p).rev()` does exactly what `.rsplit(p)` would do. (The two are subtly different for strings, in cases where the pattern can have overlapping matches.)\r\n\r\nBut is that a good enough reason to \"break symmetry\"?\r\n\r\n@brson either really expected `rsplit` to exist, or he was speaking up for a hypothetical reader, new to Rust, who might expect it. Either way, I think it should be added, just to reduce by 1 the number of curious wrinkles in libcore. I'll write an RFC if this seems reasonable.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/41020/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/41020/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
