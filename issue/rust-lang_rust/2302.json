Somebody who builds Rust for the first time is probably going to be interested in running `rustc`, but where to find it? Let's make it super simple.\n\nThis is about the directory structure of our build artifacts, not the source.\n\nFirst we move the distracting \"llvm\", \"rt\", \"rustllvm\", \"tmp\" from the top of the build structure to under each target triple. We already build most of these things per target; they have just use a different directory structure than our Rust projects. Now only \"config.mk\", \"config.stamp\", \"dl\", \"doc\", \"Makefile\", and the target-triple-named output directories are at the top of the build structure.\n\nSecond we create a symlink called \"out\" that links to `$(HOST_TRIPLE)/stage2`. Now after you do a build you just type `out/bin/rustc` instead of `x86_64-unknown-linux/stage2/bin/rustc`.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2302/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2302/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
