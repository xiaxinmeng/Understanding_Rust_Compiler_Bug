rustc::syntax can't contain code. We want especially for the standard library to define things like std::option::t as std::option.\n\nThis is one way to achieve that goal.\n\nWe add a convention that a .rs file with the same name as a directory module provides that module's implementation, and a .rs file with the same name as a crate (or the .rc file) provides the crate-level module's implementation.\n\nSo for standard we might have a directory layout like:\n\n```\nlib/\n  coll.rs - the std::coll module's implementation\n  coll/\n    list.rs - the std::coll::list module\n  std.rc\n  std.rs the std module's implementation\n```\n\nWe would probably want a way to explicitly override this as well.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1072/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1072/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
