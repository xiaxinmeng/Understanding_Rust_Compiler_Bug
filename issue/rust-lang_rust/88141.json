In the standard mental model of `?Sized`, in this context people will think `T: Trait + ?Sized` means `T` can be `dyn Trait`, which should obviously be castable to `dyn Trait` when behind a `Box`. So the error _feels_ incorrect.\r\n\r\nThe reason the error is correct is that `T` could be a different unsized type that implements the trait, for example `[u8]` or `dyn OtherTrait`. In such a case the cast to `dyn Trait` would require some kind of double-DST, which doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nI'm not quite sure how but it would be nice if this error could make this clearer.\r\n\r\nIn this specific case, if `convert` were a trait method, the solution would to have an impl for `Box<T: Sized>` and one for `Box<dyn Trait>` . Unsure if there's a good way to indicate that, but that's not as necessary as making the error clearer about why `T: Trait + ?Sized` can't be cast to `dyn Trait`", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88141/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88141/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
