This works if the method is part of an inherent implementation (that is, a method on the struct or enum itself). But if the method is part of a trait implementation, Ctrl-F won't find it because trait implementations are toggled closed by default.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure of a great way to do this. Some ideas:\r\n\r\n - Listen for Ctrl-F and temporarily open the toggles. Problems: This is probably flaky; it doesn't work when selecting \"Find in page\" from a menu; we probably wouldn't get any sort of even to know when to close them again.\r\n - Implement our own in-page search, and override Ctrl-F. Personally I find it really unpleasant when pages do this; I think the browser functionality shouldn't be overridden.\r\n - Make the trait implementation toggles opened by default. I don't know the pros/cons on this; I assume they are closed by default for a good reason.", "closed_by": {"login": "jsha", "id": 220205, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/220205?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha", "html_url": "https://github.com/jsha", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85923/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85923/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
