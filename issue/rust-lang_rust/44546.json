I'll paraphrase it here.\r\n\r\nThe only way to eagerly consume an iterator, e.g., for its side-effects, on stable Rust is to call `.collect` or `.count` (`.for_each` is nightly only). Most beginners don't associate `.count` with this, so they use `.collect`, which is horrible.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things we could do to help make it more obvious what the correct thing to do is:\r\n\r\n- make `.collect`'s result `#[must_use]`. If you are throwing `.collect`'s result away, you are doing it wrong, and should not have used `.collect` in the first place. A loop or `.for_each` would do.\r\n- make `.count`'s result `#[must_use]`: while `.count` is \"efficent\" (when compared to `.collect`) it doesn't convey what the code is actually doing\r\n- add an `.eval()` == `.for_each(|_|)`: because `.for_each(|_|)` is also ugly\r\n- address this in docs: `.collect` means copy the results of the iterator into a collection, not \"eagerly evaluate\", or similar", "closed_by": {"login": "varkor", "id": 3943692, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM2OTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943692?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor", "html_url": "https://github.com/varkor", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44546/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44546/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
