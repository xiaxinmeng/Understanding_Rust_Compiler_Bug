That seems to be mostly because it requires std::io::Read, Write, and Seek. However, I'd argue that those traits should also be part of libcore, and only the specific implementations be in libstd. After all, the Read/Write/Seek traits and the Cursor struct don't seem to rely on anything that's part of the stdlib: they don't need allocation, etc...\r\n\r\nMy use-case is, I have to write data into an array, and treating that array in a file would lead to much more idiomatic code. Furthermore it'd allow using crates like byteorder in nostd environment.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48331/reactions", "total_count": 51, "+1": 48, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 3, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48331/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
