However, there's already an outer layer of toggles for both the implementors and implementations. For instance, this is what the \"implementations\" section looks like for the Read trait, if your settings expand implementations by default:\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/220205/115167059-d8d8da80-a06a-11eb-9bad-6394fc431b28.png\" width=300>\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe toggle for each implementation is redundant with the inner toggle for the undocumented items. I think we should remove either the outer toggle or the inner. I'm not sure which is better. One argument in favor of removing the outer toggles: If someone has gone to the trouble of documenting a trait implementation, we should try to display that by default. For instance, here's what the implementations section looks like for String, by default:\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/220205/115167242-ae3b5180-a06b-11eb-9dc1-ba7866e3351f.png\" width=400>\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nHowever, if you know to expand it, there's actually some really nice documentation there:\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/220205/115167300-e9d61b80-a06b-11eb-86cd-7e08007e1d9c.png\" width=550>\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's a similar situation in `rustls`: Its `Read` implementation has important documentation on how to use it properly, but you wouldn't know that documentation was there because it's toggled closed by default.", "closed_by": {"login": "jsha", "id": 220205, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/220205?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha", "html_url": "https://github.com/jsha", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84326/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84326/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
