This is clearly incorrect as it would result in the same code.\n\nHere's the code that is causing the problem:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::rc::Rc;\n\ntype Func = Rc<Fn(Vec<usize>) -> usize>;\n\nstruct Foo {\n    a: usize,\n    f: Func,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let foo = Foo {\n        a: 22,\n        f: Rc::new(|x| x.len()),\n    };\n\n    let value = foo.f(vec![1, 2, 3]);\n    println!(\"{}\", value);\n}\n```\n\nNow that I am writing all of this out, I think the error message is suggesting that I write **only** `foo.f` and get the property instead of calling it as a function. If that's the case, then the error message should probably be clarified because that is not clear from the current message in this case.\n\n---\n\nSince I wrote this on the Rust Playground using the stable version of Rust, I assume that the version info is around the same as my local version which is also running the latest Rust:\n\n```\nrustc 1.9.0 (e4e8b6668 2016-05-18)\nbinary: rustc\ncommit-hash: e4e8b666850a763fdf1c3c2c142856ab51e32779\ncommit-date: 2016-05-18\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nrelease: 1.9.0\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "sunjay", "id": 530939, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDkzOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/530939?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sunjay", "html_url": "https://github.com/sunjay", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sunjay/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sunjay/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sunjay/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sunjay/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sunjay/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sunjay/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sunjay/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sunjay/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sunjay/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34352/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34352/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
