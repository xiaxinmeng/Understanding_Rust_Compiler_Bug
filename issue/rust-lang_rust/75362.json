However for rustc 1.45.0 the test turned negative again. (The codenamed suites e.g. \"bullseye\", \"buster\", only test for build-path-dependent reproducibility, i.e. are less strict / less ideal)\r\n\r\nOn the same bug report, @jgalenson had reported build-path-independent reproducibility for a configuration closer to rust's own builds, but this also occasionally regresses e.g. #69352.\r\n\r\nThe Debian builds and rust's own builds are slightly different; the probably-most-significant one being that Debian uses the system LLVM, so that part is excluded from reproducibility tests. Other than that, it is important to set `remap-debuginfo` in `config.toml` as well as `-ffile-prefix-map` and `-fdebug-prefix-map` for the C parts of the build, including in `CFLAGS` / `CXXFLAGS`.\r\n\r\nSince many/most contributors are not aware of all of the details needed to retain build-path-independent reproducibility, it would be good to have some CI to ensure this property in the long run. Running a full build twice is costly, but perhaps some other solution would be just as effective, e.g. running a stage1 build twice, or running it for the beta channel, and/or running with a pre-built LLVM.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75362/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75362/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
