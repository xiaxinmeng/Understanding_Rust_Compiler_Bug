As far as I know the \"env\" function can only set one environment variable. So one should call it multiple times. However, in my case, I have a number of environment variables which is known only at runtime. It could be really useful to have, as for the \"arg\" function, a \"envs\" function able to receive a vector of environment variables.\r\n\r\nCheers", "closed_by": {"login": "dzobbe", "id": 13131555, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTMxNTU1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13131555?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dzobbe", "html_url": "https://github.com/dzobbe", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dzobbe/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dzobbe/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dzobbe/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dzobbe/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dzobbe/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dzobbe/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dzobbe/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dzobbe/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dzobbe/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38455/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38455/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
