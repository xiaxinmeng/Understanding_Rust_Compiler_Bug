Even then it's missing results. For example, `std::thread::current` has signature `pub fn current() -> Thread`, yet doesn't show up in the \"As return value\" tab when searching for \"Thread\".\r\n* When searching, functions whose name is the same as its return type are not shown on the \"Types/modules\" tab. (details in my second post)\r\n* ~~I think the first tab shouldn't be labeled \"Types/modules\", as it also shows functions and macros.~~ (moved to separate issue #45787)\r\n\r\n[Link to the recent pull request implementing the search tabs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/45055)\r\n\r\ncc @GuillaumeGomez", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45608/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45608/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
