The examples have been updated to use it, but the prose still just talks about \"||\". I think this is the right place to clarify what |:|, |&:| and |&mut:| mean, and perhaps how they relate to the Fn traits (which I don't really understand, which I was looking here for clarification).\n\nThe example using \"twice()\" uses two different syntaxes. First it says:\n\n```\n fn twice<F: Fn(i32) -> i32>(x: i32, f: F) -> i32 {\n```\n\nbut later it says\n\n```\nfn twice(x: i32, f: |i32| -> i32) -> i32 {\n```\n\nAre these equivalent?\n\nI understand this is still in flux, and I gather the |:| syntax is going to go away (?) or become mostly optional(?) - either way, a paragraph with a bit of explanation would be useful.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20667/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20667/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
