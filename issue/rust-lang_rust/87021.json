So it impossible to destruct a `RawWaker` even with `transmute`, since the layout is unknown, which makdes it difficult to pass `RawWaker` or `Waker` across FFI boundary.\r\n\r\nNote that `Waker` has `repr(transparent)` on it so it's able to `transmute` into a `RawWaker`. But it barely does anything since we can do nothing with a `RawWaker`. I'm confusing about why there is a `repr(transparent)` struct to an blackbox struct without any methods.\r\n\r\nIf it's intended to NOT stabilizing the layout of `std::task::RawWaker`. I think we should at least provide methods like `fn data(&self) -> *mut ()` and `fn vtable(&self) -> &'static RawWakerVTable` to do the inverse of `RawWaker::new`, which can be used to destruct it to cross FFI boundary.", "closed_by": {"login": "Amanieu", "id": 278509, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODUwOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/278509?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu", "html_url": "https://github.com/Amanieu", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87021/reactions", "total_count": 9, "+1": 9, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87021/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
