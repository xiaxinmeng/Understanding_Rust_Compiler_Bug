I propose a syntax that looks like this:\n- `RUST_LOG=all` \u2014 logs everything.\n- `RUST_LOG=error` \u2014 logs errors.\n- `RUST_LOG=e` \u2014 same as above.\n- `RUST_LOG=warning` \u2014 logs errors and warnings.\n- `RUST_LOG=warning,typeck` \u2014 logs errors and warnings in modules nested somewhere within a module named \"typeck\" (including deeper modules).\n- `RUST_LOG=all,typeck,trans` \u2014 logs all messages coming from a module named \"typeck\" and all messages coming from a module named \"trans\"\n- `RUST_LOG=debug,rustc::middle::typeck` \u2014 logs errors and warnings in modules nested somewhere within a module named \"typeck\" inside a module named \"middle\" inside a module named \"rustc\"\n- `RUST_LOG=help` \u2014 displays a help message in the runtime, then exits.\n\nIMHO this would be easy to use.\n\nBasically the `log` statement would pass a list of module names to the runtime, and the logging function would do a string comparison on each path component to determine which to print.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pcwalton", "id": 157897, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton", "html_url": "https://github.com/pcwalton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2033/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2033/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
