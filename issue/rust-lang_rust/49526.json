It uses kernel 2.6.18. Fortunately I've been able to build a completely bootstrapped toolchain and environment with the latest glibc (2.19) supported by the kernel, and the very latest binutils, gcc, and dozens and dozens of libraries and binaries. The reason that's possible is that most packages adhere to having everything built by the system toolchain and not requiring any precompiled binaries.\r\n\r\nRust is one of the lone exceptions. For some reason it requires the use of precompiled binaries that are built against a different kernel / ABI than my host system and bootstrapped toolchain. Is there anyway to build the source and avoid the use of these stage0 binaries?
