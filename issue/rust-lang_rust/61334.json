However, currently we also require generic parameters to be ordered this way internally. This has caused issues in the past, for example:\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/9c9b7b4eaceefe88bafc3b4e3529635973320253/src/librustc_passes/ast_validation.rs#L441-L446\r\nand https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/61333. Requiring ordering causes pain points like these, without making anything easier to deal with.\r\n\r\nThe compiler has got better at handling these now that all parameters are stored in a single vector, but they still need to be ordered in some locations. To fix this, it's probably simplest to add a feature gate `unordered_generic_params` which disables the order check and trace exactly what requires the parameters to be sorted, removing those restrictions. The feature flag will allow us to add regression tests.", "closed_by": {"login": "varkor", "id": 3943692, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM2OTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943692?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor", "html_url": "https://github.com/varkor", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/61334/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/61334/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
