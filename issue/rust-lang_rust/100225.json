It happens regardless of whether the empty line contains spaces or not.\r\n\r\nI ran into this when I started documenting the fields of `struct`-like variants in an `enum`.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to fully support this style of doc-comments? I suppose that by the time `rustdoc` sees the documentation, the type of comment (line or block) and its indentation has been forgotten so it cannot be used by a de-indentation procedure. Would it be possible to special-case the first line and de-indent the others more?[^pydoc] If block comments cannot be distinguished from line comments, that has the side effect of not considering the following a doctest anymore:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n/// Short description\r\n///\r\n///     assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);\r\n```\r\n\r\n[^pydoc]: I seem to remember that Python does this for its doc-strings.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n\r\nPossibly-related issues: #59867, #63193, #64162, #88590\r\n\r\nI initially discovered the issue on stable version 1.62.1 and confirmed using the [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=40dd8ee4365c4ec48d655bd1ea662da6) that it still happens on nightly (1.65.0-nightly, 2022-08-06 2befdefdda0f2bc5ff93).", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100225/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100225/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
