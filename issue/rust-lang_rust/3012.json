crate I do:\n\n```\nimport socket;\nlet sock = @socket::socket_handle(fd);\n```\n\nAnd I get:\n\n```\nsrc/connection.rs:37:13: 37:39 error: mismatched types: expected function or foreign function but found socket::socket_handle\nsrc/connection.rs:37    let sock = @socket::socket_handle(fd);\n```\n\nThis is with rust f676547c9788b919762bfb379b1e26ebd94d3dc9\n\nWork around for now is to export a function that calls the ctor for me.\n\n(I know instance construction is being actively worked on atm, but it seems like there may be a missing unit test for this case).\n", "closed_by": {"login":
