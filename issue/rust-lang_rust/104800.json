We should decide first whether we actually want the burden of implementing `dyn*` upcasting first, since `dyn*` is not currently intended to be user-facing syntax. Due to this, the feature is not currently needed even if it is interesting and possible theoretically.\r\n2. If we decide that we do want `dyn*` upcasting, then it needs to be implemented separately from `dyn Trait` upcasting with a much narrower scope.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/104800/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/104800/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
