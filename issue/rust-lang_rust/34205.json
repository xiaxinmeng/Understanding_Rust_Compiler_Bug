I installed latest stable GDB for Debian Jessie. The good news is I can hit breakpoints. The bad news is that I'm getting Python exceptions trying to inspect some variables. My guess is that it was related to the `rust-gdb` that is being used. Perhaps I should figure out how to compile that latest gdb from source with native rust support.\n\n```\nvscode@7e105e236ffa:~/demo$ gdb --version\nGNU gdb (Debian 7.7.1+dfsg-5) 7.7.1\n\nvscode@7e105e236ffa:~/demo$ rustup show\nstable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)\nrustc 1.9.0 (e4e8b6668 2016-05-18)\n```\n\nHere, I'm using Nickel and I was hoping to be able to view the Request object, but trying to expand self resulted in a \n\n```\nPython Exception <type 'exceptions.TypeError'> Could not convert Python object: None.\n```\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/80104/15971833/003f79e0-2ef0-11e6-92dc-b04f63401d49.png)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "ctaggart", "id": 80104, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjgwMTA0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80104?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ctaggart", "html_url": "https://github.com/ctaggart", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ctaggart/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ctaggart/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ctaggart/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ctaggart/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ctaggart/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ctaggart/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ctaggart/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ctaggart/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ctaggart/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34205/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34205/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
