I was using a crate which had a struct with a number of associated items and I was trying to save typing in an error handling function.  But:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n12 |     use rocket::http::Status::*;\r\n   |                       ^^^^^^ `Status` is a struct, not a module\r\n```\r\n\r\nI looked in the Reference and I wasn't able to find any discussion of this.  In particular, I would expect it to be documented in the explanation of _Use declarations_ under _Items_.\r\n\r\nAfter considerably more digging, I found:\r\n * #24915, a closed issue where the resolution was that this is not expected to work\r\n * https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/importing-associated-constants/6610/5, a discussion about how to maybe implement this (although it seems unlikely that that approach could work for the glob import I was trying...)\r\n\r\nIt seems that this situation is likely to persist.  Maybe the error message could be improved?  Something like\r\n\r\n> hint: importing associated items is not supported; you must use a path from to the parent type each time\r\n\r\ncould help the user by letting them know they can't avoid the extra typing.\r\n\r\nI will also file an issue against the Reference.
