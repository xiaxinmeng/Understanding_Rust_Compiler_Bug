It seems to me that non-self-referential generators can be trivially cloneable if everything in their environment implements clone (including both upvars and saved state, the implementation would be non-trivial as it would have to check the current state to know which fields need cloning, but that's basically like the generated `Drop` implementation).\r\n\r\nI don't see any way that self-referential generators could be cloneable, if there were some sort of `fn clone_into(&self, place: Pin<*mut Self>)` operation they could potentially support that via re-writing the self-references, but that doesn't exist yet as far as I know. You can clone them before starting by using something like `impl (FnOnce() -> impl Generator) + Clone` instead of taking the generator directly.", "closed_by": {"login": "Nemo157", "id": 81079, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDc5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81079?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Nemo157", "html_url": "https://github.com/Nemo157", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Nemo157/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Nemo157/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Nemo157/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Nemo157/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Nemo157/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Nemo157/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Nemo157/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Nemo157/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Nemo157/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57972/reactions", "total_count": 12, "+1": 12, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57972/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
