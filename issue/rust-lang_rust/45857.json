This can range from full featured telemetry support in `rustc`/`cargo`, to a simple webapp accepting people to post compiler output. Right now the only ways we receive feedback for confusing output are:\r\n\r\n - IRC/gitter\r\n - this issue tracker\r\n - stackoverflow\r\n - /r/rust\r\n\r\nIf we added telemetry support on rustc, it would also _have_ to be opt-in, and it could start with being a simple flag passed to `rustc` to send a post request with the text output of the compiler.
