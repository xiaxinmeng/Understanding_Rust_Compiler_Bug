It would be nice to see if we can *land* those benefits, both to get some experience with aborting instead of unwinding panics in destructors (e.g., what goes wrong? any painful patterns?) and to carry forward those performance and size wins.\r\n\r\nThis flag is currently restricted to being the same across the whole crate graph though, which means we'd not be able to do this for rustc *only* since it would also affect std's destructors (which would be a user-visible change we don't want).
