Here, even though `arg` is mutably borrowed, we are allowed to make a copy (reborrow) of it. Why is this the case? As the comment shows, a read of `arg` _is_ invalid, so why isn't a reborrow? I had a discussion about this on the IRC, but I would like a second opinion, as I'm still not convinced the behavior is consistent. The only difference I see between a reborrow `let b = &*arg` and a copy `let c = arg` is the lifetimes of the resulting borrows. But I don't see why that would make the first valid but not the second..\r\n\r\n```\r\nfn f(mut arg: & bool) {\r\n  let a = & mut arg; \r\n  let b = &*arg; // allowed \r\n // this would not be allowed: let c = arg;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTested on 1.29.2.", "closed_by": {"login": "sander2", "id": 2421693, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjE2OTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2421693?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sander2", "html_url": "https://github.com/sander2", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sander2/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sander2/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sander2/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sander2/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sander2/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sander2/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sander2/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sander2/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sander2/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55248/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55248/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
