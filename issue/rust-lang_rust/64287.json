I am testing few things for a rust based operating system. I run make and I get\r\n\r\nerror[E0463]: can't find create for `core`\r\nnote: the `x-y-unknown-none` target may not be installed\r\n\r\nWhen I do `rustc --explain E0463`, I get: \r\n\r\n```\r\nA plugin/crate was declared but cannot be found. Erroneous code example:\r\n\r\n\r\n#![feature(plugin)]\r\n#![plugin(x_monster)] // error: can't find crate for `x_monster`\r\nextern crate x; // error: can't find crate for `x`\r\n\r\n\r\nYou need to link your code to the relevant crate in order to be able to use it\r\n(through Cargo or the `-L` option of rustc example). Plugins are crates as\r\nwell, and you link to them the same way.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI asked in discord channel, there folks said I create a ticket. Would be great having any pointers, I searched a little all over web nothing was useful.
