As our standard linker script does not have a linker rule for this region, building fails with with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  = note: rust-lld: error: no memory region specified for section '.ARM.exidx'\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this, this project can be used: https://github.com/ferrous-systems/embedded-trainings/tree/master/beginner/templates/segment-1. You will need to add the `thumbv7em-none-eabihf` target first. This builds with the current and previous stable releases (1.32 <= version <= 1.36), but does not build with nightly-2019-07-18. This also seems fine with rustc 1.37.0-beta.3 (2ba6de7e2 2019-07-12). I have not yet attempted to bisect this.\r\n\r\nWe've had a previous similar issue here: https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt/issues/157 - and the fix was to discard that section in our linker script template. However I first wanted to check if this new output was expected, because it would cause a stable to stable regression if folks don't update the cortex-m-rt crate, which includes the linker script template.", "closed_by": {"login": "jamesmunns", "id": 2097964, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTc5NjQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2097964?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jamesmunns", "html_url": "https://github.com/jamesmunns", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jamesmunns/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jamesmunns/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jamesmunns/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jamesmunns/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jamesmunns/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jamesmunns/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jamesmunns/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jamesmunns/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jamesmunns/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62781/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62781/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
