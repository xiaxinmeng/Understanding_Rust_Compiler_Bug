We need something attractive and consistent across all of our pages, that can be adapted to additional content as our needs grow. Some existing examples that we like are [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/), [node](http://nodejs.org/), [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).\n\nRemember that Rust is a community project, and for engineers; the purpose of our web presence isn't to sell to managers; let's just present the facts cleanly.\n\nThis task probably also includes reevaluating what content is on the front page of rust-lang.org and rewriting it.\n\nThe web page should probably, like the above examples, tell you very simply how to install Rust, and point you at the docs and other resources, and not much else.
