Instead, the compilation failed with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror[E0277]: the trait bound `std::iter::Iterator<Item=&u64>: std::marker::Sized` is not satisfied\r\n --> iter.rs:2:9\r\n  |\r\n2 |      *t.min().unwrap()\r\n  |         ^^^ trait `std::iter::Iterator<Item=&u64>: std::marker::Sized` not satisfied\r\n  |\r\n  = note: `std::iter::Iterator<Item=&u64>` does not have a constant size known at compile-time\r\n\r\nerror: aborting due to previous error\r\n```\r\n\r\nBeing a beginner in Rust, this error message threw me off. First, I couldn't understand why Rust was insisting that the object is unsized, when the object was declared to accept a *reference* (fat pointer) to a trait, or that was at least my intention. (I still don't understand this part.)\r\n\r\nMore importantly, there was no hint that the problem could be resolved simply by changing `&` to `&mut` in declaration and invocation. Once I realized that, the change was obvious and easy, but the compiler's error message did not help me understand the problem.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37914/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37914/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
