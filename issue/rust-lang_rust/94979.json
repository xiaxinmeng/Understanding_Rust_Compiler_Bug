I will close this now.\r\n\r\n\r\n~~I have been working with UdpSocket's on **macOS** recently and noticed that when setting the socket to **non-blocking**, using the `recv` or `recv_from` functions **sometimes** return WouldBlock, but other times return `EAGAIN` or `\"Resource temporarily unavailable\"` error. This is expected behavior from macOS, but anyone working with `UdpSocket`'s or `TcpStream`'s would be unaware of this. I am suggesting that a note is added to the [`UdpSocket`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.UdpSocket.html) and [`TcpStream`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.TcpStream.html#) documentation about this behavior.~~\r\n\r\n~~Apple docs about this behavior: [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man2/recv.2.html)~~\r\n\r\n~~Other resources: (from [beej.us](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/))\r\n```(Wait\u2014it can return EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK?

The specification doesn\u2019t actually specify which your system will return, so for portability, check them both.)```~~", "closed_by": {"login": "undersquire", "id": 55647897, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU1NjQ3ODk3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55647897?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/undersquire", "html_url": "https://github.com/undersquire", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/undersquire/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/undersquire/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/undersquire/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/undersquire/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/undersquire/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/undersquire/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/undersquire/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/undersquire/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/undersquire/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94979/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94979/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
