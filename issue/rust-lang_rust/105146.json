\ud83d\udc1b Please provide a short summary of the bug,\r\nalong with any information you feel relevant to replicating the bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Many thanks to @celinval for alerting me to the existence of this issue.)\r\n\r\nI tried this code ([playpen](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=5e85b3be710d8d1383fa313e6b1e832b)):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub mod a {\r\n    use std::ffi::c_int;\r\n    extern \"C\" { fn isalpha(_: c_int) -> c_int; }\r\n    pub fn wrap(x: c_int) -> c_int { unsafe { isalpha(x) } }\r\n}\r\n\r\npub mod b {\r\n    use std::ffi::c_int;\r\n    extern \"C\" { fn isalpha(_: c_int, _: c_int) -> c_int; }\r\n    pub fn wrap(x: c_int, y: c_int) -> c_int { unsafe { isalpha(x, y) } }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    dbg!(a::wrap(10));\r\n    dbg!(b::wrap(10, 20));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected to see this happen: code should be rejected as obviously wrong, since within the same codegen unit, it is using two incompatible declarations for the same external foreign function.\r\n\r\nInstead, this happened: the code is accepted by the compiler with just a warning: \r\n\r\n```\r\nwarning: `isalpha` redeclared with a different signature\r\n --> src/main.rs:9:18\r\n  |\r\n3 |     extern \"C\" { fn isalpha(_: c_int) -> c_int; }\r\n  |                  ------------------------------ `isalpha` previously declared here\r\n...\r\n9 |     extern \"C\" { fn isalpha(_: c_int, _: c_int) -> c_int; }\r\n  |                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ this signature doesn't match the previous declaration\r\n  |\r\n  = note: `#[warn(clashing_extern_declarations)]` on by default\r\n  = note: expected `unsafe extern \"C\" fn(i32) -> i32`\r\n             found `unsafe extern \"C\" fn(i32, i32) -> i32`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis lint was added in PR #70946; there was an attempt, in PR #75192, to make the lint deny-by-default, but that attempt was abandoned (see associated [comment explaining why that was abandoned](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75192#issuecomment-684921235)). \r\n\r\nIts important to note in particular that in the case of these clashing declarations, you can see in the generated LLVM-IR that there is truly **only one** declaration chosen, and the order in which one feeds the `mod a` and `mod b` above will dictate which extern fn declaration is selected by LLVM.\r\n\r\n(Its possible that we may need a more precise variant of the existing `clashing_extern_declarations` lint that more precisely identifies the problematic cases.)\r\n\r\nI personally suspect that this error represents enough of a red flag that we really should be aiming to turn the existing lint into a hard-error, even if only over an edition boundary for the language.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n<!--\r\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\r\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nrustc --version --verbose:\r\n\r\nStable channel\r\n\r\nBuild using the Stable version: 1.65.0\r\n\r\n\r\nNightly channel\r\n\r\nBuild using the Nightly version: 1.67.0-nightly (2022-11-30 c97b539e408ea353f4fd)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/105146/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/105146/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
