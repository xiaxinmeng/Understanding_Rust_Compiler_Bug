And I also understand that Cargo automatically runs that tag on `allow` level. But what would be a high-value use case of me actually writing that tag manually? Aren't the higher-intensity lints more important than the lower-intensity lints? Why don't you filter away the lower-intensity lints instead? Would be great if you explained to me but also wrote in the documentation. Doing so will help the reader understand why reading that part of the doc would be worthwhile.
