For all that this says, maybe its going to return `old + 1` or `!old`, rather than the contents of memory at the time that the failed swap was attempted.\n\nSo right now, if I want to be portable and follow these docs, I need to issue a separate call to the `load` method to load a current value, e.g. if my plan is to loop around and recompute the next value I want to store from the concurrently updated current value.\n\n---\n\nNow, maybe this is not an oversight in the documentation, but is in fact a deliberate underspecification of the return value for `compare_and_swap` -- i.e. maybe we do not want to guarantee too much about the underling behavior of the target system.\n\nBut in my opinion, a return value that is so woefully underspecified is no better than returning a boolean flag indicating whether the swap was successful or not.\n\nAnd in any case, if this _is_ a deliberate underspecification on the part of the documentation, then it should explicitly say something like \"when the value is not updated, then the return value will be unequal to `old`, but is otherwise unspecified.\"  (Because right now it is very easy for a reader to infer that the \"currently stored\" value that is unequal to `old` is what is returned.)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21668/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21668/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
