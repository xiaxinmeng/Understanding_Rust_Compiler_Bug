One lives in the `check_consts` directory, and is responsible for the checks that run in all const contexts. The other is `qualify_min_const_fn`, which performs additional checks within `const fn` when `#![feature(const_fn)]` is not enabled. The split was necessary to push `const fn` feature over the finish line due to technical debt in the const-qualification code, but it resulted in some checks being duplicated between the two modules. Const-qualification has since been rewritten entirely, and it should be possible to unify the two to reduce the maintenance burden and improve diagnostics.\r\n\r\nI half-heartedly attempted this in #68940, but eventually abandoned it due to the volume of error message changes and reticence from a former lang-team member. However, I think we should give this another try, since the split has caused some confusion about `#![feature(const_fn)]` (see #76602) and there was a request from the libs-team to change how stability attributes affect whether the `qualify_min_const_fn` runs (see #75794).\r\n\r\nI did not fully understand when writing #68940 that `qualify_min_const_fn` is responsible for ensuring that publicly exported, stable `const fn` in `staged_api` crates do not rely on unstable features as part of their implementation. `check_consts` makes no such effort. So far, we've relied on the review process to enforce this, but I think one of the first steps will be to add this functionality to `check_consts`, enabling it only within `const fn` at first. After that, we can define new structured errors for each of the checks in `qualify_min_const_fn` in the `check_consts` framework and disable the former entirely. At first, all of these checks will be controlled by the `#![feature(const_fn)]` feature gate, but I think we should assign a new gate to each (floating point arithmetic within `const fn`, `impl Trait`, etc.).\r\n\r\n@oli-obk, would you be willing to review this work? Is there anything I missed?\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* [x] Fully [remove `qualify_min_const_fn`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76618#issuecomment-699201921)\r\n* [ ] ...
