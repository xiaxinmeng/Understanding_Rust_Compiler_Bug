The basic issue is that having multiple entities in the same scope with the same name but different DWARF tags makes it a pain for gdb to sensibly create its symbol table.\n\nI see the issue with a number of constructs.  For this example, consider something like:\n\n```\nenum MoreComplicated {\n    One,\n    Two(i32),\n}\n```\n\nThe DWARF gets an enum:\n\n```\n <2><6d>: Abbrev Number: 4 (DW_TAG_enumeration_type)\n    <6e>   DW_AT_type        : <0x415>\n    <72>   DW_AT_enum_class  : 1\n    <72>   DW_AT_name        : (indirect string, offset: 0x16e): MoreComplicated\n    <76>   DW_AT_byte_size   : 1\n```\n\n... but also a union:\n\n```\n <2><a7>: Abbrev Number: 6 (DW_TAG_union_type)\n    <a8>   DW_AT_name        : (indirect string, offset: 0x16e): MoreComplicated\n    <ac>   DW_AT_byte_size   : 24\n```\n\nIt would be better for gdb to unify these two objects into a single representation in DWARF.  For gdb's purposes it is fine if this representation requires some special Rust-specific code, for example knowing what names to insert into what scopes.\n\nThis is related to issue #32920, in that maybe a tagged variant would also help this situation.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/32924/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/32924/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
