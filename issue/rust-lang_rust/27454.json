Basically, `PATH_MAX` just doesn't work.\n\nCurrently. Rust uses `PATH_MAX` in a few important places.\n\n./src/libstd/sys/unix/fs.rs:377:`let mut buf = vec![0;libc::PATH_MAX as usize];`\n./src/libstd/sys/unix/fs.rs:469:`len = 1024; // FIXME: read PATH_MAX from C ffi?`\n./src/rt/rust_builtin.c:337:`char buf[2*PATH_MAX], exe[2*PATH_MAX];`\n./src/rt/rust_builtin.c:380:`snprintf(buf, 2*PATH_MAX, \"%s/%s\", paths[i], argv0);`\n\nGenerally, the best approach to work around this is to loop and double a buffer in size until it is big enough in size to fill with the path or to query the size of the path of the file using `fpathconf`.  I'm not sure if any filesystems on any modern OSes return -1 for the result of  `fpathconf`.  Letting things get too big opens up a DOS attack though so be careful I guess?\n\nThe `fpathconf` strategy or the doubling buffer strategy can be done with ./src/libstd/sys/unix/fs.rs:469 but I'm not sure how to handle the Rust cases that use `realpath` (unless `realpath` is reimplemented by hand).  The C code can just use the `NULL` argument but I forget if there's a way to martial allocated by C data to Rust. \n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27454/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27454/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
