AFAIK, this did not go through an RFC, and is inconsistent with the design used elsewhere in the standard library based on the strong consensus in the previous discussions on the mailing list and issue tracker. For example, `from_raw_parts` is a method on `Vec` and _was_ a method on `String` but has been deprecated.\n\nStatic methods play very well with Rust's import system, because it allows accessing all of the methods via the scope. It's already marked `unsafe`, and going out of the way to make `unsafe` code painful just makes the language lose appeal as a systems language.\n\nThe parameters also shifted around in `from_parts` relative to `from_raw_parts` on Vec<T> and String, so even that part of the design is inconsistent with `Vec<T>`.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "aturon", "id": 709807, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTgwNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/709807?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon", "html_url": "https://github.com/aturon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16708/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16708/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
