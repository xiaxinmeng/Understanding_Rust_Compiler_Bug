The `...` syntax in patterns is stable and will remain (silently) deprecated for the time being; rustfmt can rewrite `...` to `..=`. This comes after much discussion. [See this comment for justification.](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28237#issuecomment-304145654)\r\n\r\n**No more syntax discussion should be had in this thread**. Any different proposals of exclusive range syntax should take place on the [user's forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/) or [internals forum](https://internals.rust-lang.org/), **after** you have read all existing comments and their rationale here. Notably, breaking backwards compatibility is a non-starter.\r\n\r\n### Steps to take\r\n\r\n* [x] Initial implementation\r\n* [x] Change to accept `..=` as synonym for `...` in patterns and to accept `..=` in expressions #44709\r\n    - [Initial mentoring instructions on writing the PR can be found here.](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28237#issuecomment-304308234)\r\n* [x] Documentation\r\n    * [x] Book rust-lang/book#1134\r\n    * [x] Reference rust-lang-nursery/reference#215\r\n    * [x] Rust-by-example rust-lang/rust-by-example#1015\r\n* [x] https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1980 proposed a tweak to `RangeInclusive`\r\n* [x] Stabilization #47813\r\n    * Note: The fields of `RangeInclusive` have been left out from this round of stabilization.
