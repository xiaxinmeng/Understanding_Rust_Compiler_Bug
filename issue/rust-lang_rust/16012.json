It would be more efficient to use guard pages to detect these. We already have guard pages on all the stacks. However to ensure that the code doesn't skip the guard pages, we need to insert stack probes. LLVM already can generate code for that on x86 and ARM for Windows. We'd just need to expose that as an option on other platforms.\n\nIt would be nice if support for stack probes could be added to MIPS in LLVM too, so we can  get rid of the runtime support for the stack overflow checking.\n\nUsing stack probes is also easy and desirable to support in freestanding mode.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bstrie", "id": 865233, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTIzMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/865233?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie", "html_url": "https://github.com/bstrie", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16012/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16012/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
