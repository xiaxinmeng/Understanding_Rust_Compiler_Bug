The goal of this page is describe why this change was made and how you can fix code that is affected by it. It also provides a place to ask questions or register a complaint if you feel the change should not be made.\r\n\r\n#### What is the warning for?\r\n\r\nThe `missing_fragment_specifier` warning is issued when an unused pattern in a `macro_rules!` macro definition has a meta-variable (e.g. `$e`) that is not followed by a fragment specifier (e.g. `:expr`).\r\n\r\nThis warning can always be fixed by removing the unused pattern in the `macro_rules!` macro definition.\r\n\r\n#### When will this warning become a hard error?\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each 6-week release cycle, the Rust compiler team will review the set of outstanding future compatibility warnings and nominate some of them for Final Comment Period. Toward the end of the cycle, we will review any comments and make a final determination whether to convert the warning into a hard error or remove it entirely.\r\n\r\n#### Current status\r\n- [x] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/39419 introduces the `missing_fragment_specifier` lint as warn-by-default\r\n- [x] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/42894 makes the `missing_fragment_specifier` lint deny-by-default\r\n- [ ] #75516 makes the `missing_fragment_specifier` lint a hard error", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40107/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40107/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
