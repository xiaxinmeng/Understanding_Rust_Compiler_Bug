So here's what I was initially seeing:\n\n![no-font](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/618839/5159988/5db24550-7338-11e4-9e32-0427a9fbcdb6.jpg)\n\nThen i found and disabled a single CSS rule and got this:\n\n![no-css-rule](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/618839/5159990/6dc753ea-7338-11e4-9ece-983f6923e5ef.jpg)\n\nI would file this issue with the rust-lang/rust-www repository but then I had the same problem with viewing documentation pages from 3rd-party crates hosted on Github so I'm assuming it's Rust's documentation generator itself that is generating this CSS rule.  I have installed the \"fira\" font from the ArchLinux AUR and no longer have to disable the CSS rule, but there really should be a fall-back font set.  In case it's relevant I'm running ArchLinux x86_64, Gnome 3.14.2 and Firefox 33.1.1.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "rnd42", "id": 618839, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYxODgzOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/618839?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnd42", "html_url": "https://github.com/rnd42", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnd42/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnd42/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnd42/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnd42/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnd42/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnd42/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnd42/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnd42/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rnd42/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19257/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19257/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
