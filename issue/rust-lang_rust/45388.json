Given that `pub(crate)` exists, this should be relatively straight-forward. \r\n\r\nVisibilities are stored in [the AST type `Visibility`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e3fb84e951e3c602d2dbbfebbd4ee275ac414893/src/libsyntax/ast.rs#L1793). We will want to extend the `Crate` variant to include one additional field, indicating whether the sugar `crate` or the expanded form `pub(crate)` was used. We can add an enum like \r\n\r\n```rust\r\nenum CrateSugar {\r\n    /// User wrote `pub(crate)`\r\n    PubCrate,\r\n\r\n    /// User wrote `crate`\r\n    JustCrate,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand add this field to [the `Crate` variant](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e3fb84e951e3c602d2dbbfebbd4ee275ac414893/src/libsyntax/ast.rs#L1793), so that it looks like `Crate(Span, CrateSugar)`. Actually, at the same time we can remove the `Span` field, which appears to be unused, so it would just become `Crate(CrateSugar)`. Doing this simultaneously is sorta bad but will save you some editing, since all existing uses look like `Crate(_)`, and 99% of them want to ignore the `CrateSugar` field anyway. =)\r\n\r\nThe one user that does NOT want to ignore `CrateSugar` is the pretty printer.  We just want to change [this line](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e3fb84e951e3c602d2dbbfebbd4ee275ac414893/src/libsyntax/print/pprust.rs#L1443) to something like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n ast::Visibility::Crate(CrateSugar::PubCrate) => self.word_nbsp(\"pub(crate)\"),\r\n ast::Visibility::Crate(CrateSugar::JustCrate) => self.word_nbsp(\"crate\"),\r\n```\r\n\r\nNaturally, we also will want to alter the parser itself, in particular [the `parse_visibility` function](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e3fb84e951e3c602d2dbbfebbd4ee275ac414893/src/libsyntax/parse/parser.rs#L5325). Currently, if it doesn't see the word `pub`, [it just returns](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e3fb84e951e3c602d2dbbfebbd4ee275ac414893/src/libsyntax/parse/parser.rs#L5328). We need to extend this to look for `crate` and -- if it finds it -- to return the new visibility (with sugar `JustCrate`). We also need to modify [the existing `pub(crate)` code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e3fb84e951e3c602d2dbbfebbd4ee275ac414893/src/libsyntax/parse/parser.rs#L5341) to return `PubCrate` for the sugar.\r\n\r\n(Note: Please limit discussion on this issue strictly to implementation concerns relative to this particular change.
