For some reason rustc concretized the object to an `Option<()>` (guessing based on `{:?}` output, as I can't tell why it was concretized) when it was ambiguous (we really wanted an `Option<u64>` but didn't specify it).\r\n\r\nYou can see the change which fixes it at https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1195, which makes pretty clear that the object's type was, in fact, ambiguous (switching the changed declaration to `None::<()>` works just as well, while changing behavior). The `read_tlv_fields` macro isn't all that complicated - https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/main/lightning/src/util/ser_macros.rs#L332 - it basically just calls into `decode_tlv_stream` which is pretty straightforward - https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/main/lightning/src/util/ser_macros.rs#L168.\r\n\r\nI tried (and failed) to get a minimum reproduction which at least shows the high-level code structure at https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2015&gist=c873827053afdaa20d333703d00fd16f (the actual relevant things are mostly in `util::ser` and `util::ser_macros` in the real code).", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/91369/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/91369/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
