I'm new to Rust so please forgive me if I have missed something.\r\n\r\nI was not able to conclusively determine from the specification the behaviour of the following snippet (in release builds):\r\n\r\n    \"129\".parse::<i8>().expect(\"parse\")\r\n\r\nThis issue is a docs bug report.  The actual Rust behaviour (returning an error result and producing a panic from the expect) seems good to me.\r\n\r\nThe only documentation I could find about the behaviour of the i8 etc. types on overflow is here:\r\n  https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/ch03-02-data-types.html#integer-overflow\r\nwhich is rather vague.  It is not clear whether the statement\r\n\r\n    In release builds, Rust does not check for overflow, and instead will do something called \"two's complement wrapping.\"\r\n\r\napplies only to arithmetic operations or to other things.  One obvious reading would have the snippet above give the value -127; this seemed to me to be an undesirable behaviour but it isn't generally a good idea to assume that undocumented behaviour is as one personally desires, and I'm sure you'll agree that having to write a test program is not ideal.\r\n\r\nIMO the overflow behaviour of traits like Add and Parse ought to be documented in the definition of the i8 type or something linked from:\r\n  https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.i8.html\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56471/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56471/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
