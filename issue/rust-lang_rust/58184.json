This unblocks `TryFrom` and `TryInto` https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/33417.\r\n\r\n#49593 has now been fixed. This was the reason for the previous revert of stabilization (#50121).\r\n\r\n## What is being stabilized\r\n\r\n* `!` is now a full-fledged type and can now be used in any type position (eg. [RFC 1216](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1216)). The `!` type can coerce into any other type, see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/test/run-fail/adjust_never.rs for an example.\r\n* The `never_type` feature gate is stable, although some of the behaviours it used to gate now live behind the new `exhaustive_patterns` feature gate (see below).\r\n\r\n## What is *not* being stabilized\r\n\r\n* Exhaustive pattern-matching for uninhabited types. eg.\r\n\r\n    ```rust\r\n    let x: Result<u32, !> = ...;\r\n    let Ok(y) = x;\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n  This code will still complain that `Ok(_)` is a refutable pattern. This can be fixed by using the `exhaustive_patterns` feature gate. See [RFC 1872](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1872) for progress on this issue. See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/test/ui/feature-gate-exhaustive-patterns.rs for the testcase which confirms that this behaviour is still gated.\r\n\r\n* The type inference changes proposed in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48950 are not part of this proposal, since they can break some previously-valid programs and the mitigations discussed in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57012 are not ready yet.\r\n\r\n  This change is moved to a new dedicated feature gate, `inference_fallback_to_never`, instead of `never_type`.\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58184/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 3, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58184/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
