So, `unsafe_code` should not trigger on an `unsafe fn` alone: there is not necessarily any unsafe code inside!\n\nThis has practical effect. Consider one crate defining interfaces with unsafe methods (e.g. representing an OS API). Another crate wants to create mock implementations of these interfaces that are 100% safe. While any crate consuming these mocks will necessarily contain `unsafe {...}` blocks, it is nice for the test support crate to declare it itself has only safe code.\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"Ezrashaw\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108926/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108926/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
