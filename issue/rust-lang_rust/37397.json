This is a bit laborious and not handy. So is it possible to add to Rustc a compilation switch similar to Go that outputs all the lines and column where LLVM isn't able to remove array bound tests?\n\n```\nIn-bound test(s):\n16 | foo[i] -= 1;\n         ^\n\n32 | foo[i] += bar[j];\n         ^         ^\n```\n\n(Having this compiler switch is only about one third of this performance battle).\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37397/reactions", "total_count": 8, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 6, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37397/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
