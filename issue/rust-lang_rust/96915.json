So, below example should happily read a bunch of bytes from stdin, and print them out to stdout as byte vectors.  \r\n\r\n```rust    \r\n    let mut buf:Vec<u8> = Vec::with_capacity(512);\r\n    stdin_lock.read(buf.as_mut_slice());\r\n\r\n```\r\nNow, actually running this will read nothing into buf, and will not produce errors or warnings. \r\nThe reason this is happening is subtle - buf has capacity, but once it is converted into a slice, that slice is actually empty. For this reason, nothing gets read.  \r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexpyattaev", "id": 5932526, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzI1MjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5932526?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexpyattaev", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexpyattaev", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexpyattaev/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexpyattaev/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexpyattaev/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexpyattaev/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexpyattaev/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexpyattaev/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexpyattaev/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexpyattaev/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexpyattaev/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/96915/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/96915/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
