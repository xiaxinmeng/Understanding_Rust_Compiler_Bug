We use the `track_caller` feature in `From::from` implementation of the error types to collect stack traces with generics and auto and negative impl traits magic implemented by @sergeyboyko0791 (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2.1/mm2src/common/mm_error/mm_error.rs).\r\n\r\nAfter updating to the latest nightly toolchain this stack trace collection started to work differently. I've created a small project for the demo: https://github.com/artemii235/questionmark_track_caller_try_trait_v2\r\n\r\n`cargo +nightly-2021-05-17 run` outputs `Location { file: \"src/main.rs\", line: 18, col: 23 }` as we expect.\r\n\r\n`cargo +nightly-2021-07-18 run` outputs `Location { file: \"/rustc/c7331d65bdbab1187f5a9b8f5b918248678ebdb9/library/core/src/result.rs\", line: 1897, col: 27 }` - the `from_residual` implementation that is now used for `?` desugaring.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to make the track caller work the same way as it was before? Maybe we can use some workaround in our code?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help!\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87401/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87401/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
