Can you help with following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Do binaries produced by Rust include any portions of the Rust compiler?\r\n2. If the answer is yes, does the Rust license stipulate that the resulting binary must then attribute that material under an Apache or MIT license? In other words, are we required to attribute Rust and any of the 3rd party components used by Rust, i.e. components in the vendor/ subdir,  when we ship the Rust binary?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your help.", "closed_by": {"login": "nagisa", "id": 679122, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTEyMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/679122?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa", "html_url": "https://github.com/nagisa", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93879/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93879/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
