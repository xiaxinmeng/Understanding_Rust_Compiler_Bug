For example, why does this case fail? It's trying to apply that feature to the enclosing module which seems reasonable:\n\n``` rust\npub mod inner {\n    // Not valid. `feature` is only applicable to crates.\n    #![feature(step_by)]\n    pub fn threes() {\n        for i in (0..10).step_by(3) { println!(\"{}\", i); }\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    inner::threes();\n}\n```\n\nIt would be useful to expand it to include examples that show actual usage patterns like how to enable `#![feature()]`, `#[test]`, and `#[cfg]` patterns on a `lib.rs` and `main.rs` files in a practical fashion. This seems like it would enable people much more than it does currently.\n\nMy attempt at answering such a question is [here](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/i-love-rust-but-one-thing-about-modules-is-aweful/2930/35) in case it's useful.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28643/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28643/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
