However, I ran into a problem where `dev-dependencies` activates feature flags in a workspace unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nI have a repository [here](https://github.com/AaronKutch/weird_flags) that demonstrates a reduced form of the issue. As some background to this setup, I have a complicated workspace that manages several crates. It used to always require nightly, because I needed a lot of features to enable `const` on a lot of functions, and it was one of the main points of the library. I realized that some users would not need the `const` functionality and find compilation on stable more important, so I decided to introduce a \"const_support\" flag. Some of these features are really close to stabilization, so I decided to use the `never_type` feature to simulate bringing in nightly dependencies for the example.\r\n\r\nIn the example repo, you can successfully run `cargo build` from within `nightly_user` with a nightly compiler, and you can successfully run `cargo build` from within `stable_user` with a stable compiler. The unexpected part to me is that from within the workspace, the stable compiler fails on `cargo build` despite no `dependencies` or `build-dependencies` requiring the flag. The problem is fixed by removing the dev-dependencies of the \"b\" crate. It might seem strange that the \"b\" crate has a dev-dependency on its dependent \"a\" crate, but believe me this makes a lot more sense in the workspace I reduced this from.\r\n\r\nI can easily fix the particular case I have, but I think this is a bug that could cause more problems in the future if an independent `dev-dependency` silently activates a feature that I am not explicitly activating.", "closed_by": {"login": "AaronKutch", "id": 32419308, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDE5MzA4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32419308?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/AaronKutch", "html_url": "https://github.com/AaronKutch", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AaronKutch/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AaronKutch/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AaronKutch/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AaronKutch/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AaronKutch/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AaronKutch/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AaronKutch/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AaronKutch/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AaronKutch/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86894/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86894/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
