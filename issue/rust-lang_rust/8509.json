For example, linux-32 usually uses cdecl, win-32 uses stdcall, and win-64 uses win64-specific convention.\nSo if we want to bind a function universally, we have to duplicate `extern ... {}` block for each platform, e.g.\n\n``` Rust\n#[cfg(target_os = \"linux\")]\nextern \"cdecl\" {\n    fn func();\n    ...\n}\n#[cfg(target_os = \"win32\", target_arch = \"x86\")]\nextern \"stdcall\" {\n    fn func();\n    ...\n}\n#[cfg(target_os = \"win32\", target_arch = \"x86_64\")]\nextern { // this is identical to extern \"C\" or extern \"cdecl\"\n    fn func();\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nwhich is inconvenient and fragile. (I actually copied [large extern blob](https://github.com/klutzy/rust/blob/1f831d9637232805d6fb82f6f1c8b6869e066860/src/libstd/libc.rs#L3127) for Mingw-w64 support (#8488).)\n\nOther option is to generate binding code per platform from template. [lifthrasiir/rust-opengles-angle](https://github.com/lifthrasiir/rust-opengles-angle) uses the approach for egl binding.\n\nI think it's good to add default calling convention keyword e.g. \"platform\" so that\n\n``` Rust\nextern \"platform\" {\n    fn func();\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nwhere \"platform\" is interpreted as cdecl for linux-32, stdcall for win32, and so on. It would solve the issue for most cases.\n\nEDIT: in irc @luqmana suggested to change `extern {}` (no abi specified) as platform-native callconv. (It's currently interpreted as \"cdecl\".) I think it's the best option.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "klutzy", "id": 1589355, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkzNTU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1589355?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/klutzy", "html_url": "https://github.com/klutzy", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klutzy/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klutzy/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klutzy/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klutzy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klutzy/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klutzy/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klutzy/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klutzy/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klutzy/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8509/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8509/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
