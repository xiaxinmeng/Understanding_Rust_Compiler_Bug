I feel the merge made the situation worst, and less inclusive then it was before.\n\nIn short the it went from a 'crime of omission' to actively and knowingly being exclusive. Prior to the merge someone took a quote and put it in the docs (we can argue if that's good or bad and if quotes should be changed or not but that's not the issue I want to rise here). The quote had male pronouns instead of neutral ones, I see why that is something to consider to change. But at that point the worst the rust community can be blamed for is an oversight or if you want to go out of your way ignorance but not hostility.\n\nNow with the merge there was a decision made, the decision was to use female pronouns despite it having been brought up that gender neutral ones were more appropriate. And no this is not going down the road 'but meh meh it's discriminating against dudes' - not the point. But it was brought up and bluntly ignored that there are people who identify with neither gender, not female nor male and that part of the demographic is often way worst of then female not to mention males.\n\nSo in the bottom line this merge moves a bit of ignorance in the docs to knowingly and purposefully being exclusive towards that part of the population.\n\nIn my eyes not a good move.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Licenser", "id": 119093, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjExOTA5Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119093?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Licenser", "html_url": "https://github.com/Licenser", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Licenser/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Licenser/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Licenser/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Licenser/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Licenser/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Licenser/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Licenser/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Licenser/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Licenser/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25650/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25650/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
