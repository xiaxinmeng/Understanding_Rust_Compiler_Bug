The reason for this is a consequence of a couple of other rules that I worked out as part of the temporary lifetime stuff.\n\nIn general, `let <pat> = <rvalue>` where `<pat>` is not a single identifier is equivalent to:\n\n```\nlet _tmp = <rvalue>;\nlet <path> = _tmp;\n```\n\nIn this case, that means that `let _ = <rvalue>` should be:\n\n```\nlet _tmp = <rvalue>;\nlet _ = tmp;\n```\n\nand since the `_` pattern just ignores the thing it matches against, this means that `_tmp` is unaffected and drops at the end of the block.\n\nHowever, the following test case suggests that this is not what we do today:\n\n```\nstruct Foo;\n\nimpl Drop for Foo {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        println!(\"Hi2!\");\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n     let _ = Foo;\n     println!(\"Hi1!\");\n}\n```\n\nThis should print `Hi1` and then `Hi2` but in fact it prints the opposite. This is probably a hold-over from the special code that was in trans to special case the treatment of `let _` vs other patterns, but I could be wrong.\n\ncc @pcwalton @pnkfelix \n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16526/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16526/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
