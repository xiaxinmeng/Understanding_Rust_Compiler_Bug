The current usage of the module is essentially tailored for whatever `std::io::process` needed to get implemented. Some things I believe need to improve:\n- Is `PipeStream` the right name?\n- `PipeStream` should be constructable with a function that takes no arguments\n- Should the underlying file descriptor be exposed through a method?\n\nI'm nominating this, but I don't view this as a super-critical piece of infrastructure. My current feeling is that it's \"good as is\" except for the name `PipeStream` which I can learn to live with. The other extra methods can be added later. That being said, this module needs a close look to ensure there's nothing backwards incompatible we'll want to live with.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13538/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13538/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
