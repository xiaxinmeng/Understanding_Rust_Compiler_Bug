This would make ARCs a bit nicer to use and would be more consistent with the other arc types.\n- MutexARC should have read and write methods instead of an access method. This is more consistent with RWARC, makes the semantics of the code clearer, and is important for types like LinearMap where the API changes depending on whether the reference is immutable or not (and currently if you have a mutable reference you cannot get an immutable reference without something like the Mut type or unsafe).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "catamorphism", "id": 427212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzIxMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/427212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism", "html_url": "https://github.com/catamorphism", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4292/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4292/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
