I would keep single line as default, but having a multiline option would really improve test reporting.\r\n\r\nUltimately nothing building on top can do anything nice unless we find a way to format as {:#?}, so we really need to find a way to enable this as an option.\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80787/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80787/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
