I'm also not sure if what I'm trying to do is deliberately impossible and if so I might consider this an issue in the `rustc` help message informing of the option, rather than the code-generation.\r\n- Minimal example [here](https://github.com/yehuthi/rustc_dwarf_version).\r\n\r\nI'm on x86_64 Arch Linux and rustc 1.65.0-nightly (1d37ed661 2022-09-09).", "closed_by": {"login": "yehuthi", "id": 93691725, "node_id": "U_kgDOBZWfTQ", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93691725?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yehuthi", "html_url": "https://github.com/yehuthi", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yehuthi/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yehuthi/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yehuthi/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yehuthi/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yehuthi/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yehuthi/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yehuthi/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yehuthi/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yehuthi/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/101892/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/101892/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
