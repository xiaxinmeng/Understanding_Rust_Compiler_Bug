As a user, when I do:\r\n\r\n`RUST_LOG=debug cargo run`\r\n\r\nI very much do not expect to be inundated with parse trees and such from `cargo` and `rustc`. This isn't a fabricated issue--I watched this confusion happen to numerous people in independent settings. While this can be mitigated by filtering your `RUST_LOG` by module, there's no obvious way to say \"I want everything from my application and its dependencies, but nothing from the tooling.\"\r\n\r\nI initially proposed fixing this for `cargo` by using a `CARGO_LOG` environment variable in [Cargo PR #6605](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6605), but @alexcrichton rightly pointed out that that's only a partial solution to the problem and that to really get the behavior I want, we'd need to make a similar change at least to `rustc`, potentially sharing a new variable. (`RUST_INTERNAL_LOG`? Lots of bikeshedding possibilities here.)\r\n\r\nTo start determining if this is even feasible, I need to answer a few questions:\r\n\r\n1. Is the `RUST_LOG` environment variable considered part of the stable interface for `rustc`? Is changing this even a possibility, putting aside whether it's desired?\r\n2. If this is possible, is there a strong reason NOT to do this (other than inertia) that I'm not considering?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any consideration and input.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "davidtwco", "id": 1295100, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTUxMDA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1295100?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidtwco", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidtwco", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidtwco/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidtwco/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidtwco/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidtwco/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidtwco/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidtwco/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidtwco/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidtwco/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidtwco/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57985/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57985/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
