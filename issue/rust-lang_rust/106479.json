While I like the idea, it couldn't be as simple as a `From<&'static str>`/`TryFrom<&'static str>`: error messages would need at least a character offset + string message to be more useful than just \"hey, this string contains a problem character\". Also, `&CStr`s are really more like byte string literals, and that offset would have to be a byte offset, not a `char` offset, too.\r\n\r\nThis probably could justify the existence of such a trait, though. C string literals in particular wouldn't push the boundaries much, but I could see other things like regular expressions benefitting a ton from it.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/106479/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/106479/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
