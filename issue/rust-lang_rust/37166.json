The goal of this page is describe why this change was made and how you can fix code that is affected by it. It also provides a place to ask questions or register a complaint if you feel the change should not be made. For more information on the policy around future-compatibility warnings, see our [breaking change policy guidelines](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1589-rustc-bug-fix-procedure.md).\n#### What is the warning for?\n\nThere has been a longstanding bug in rustc (#18937) that sometimes allowed an impl\nto place additional requirements on its methods above and beyond the requirements\nthat appear in the trait definition. For example:\n\n``` rust\ntrait Trait {\n    fn foo<F>(&mut self, f: F)\n        where F: Clone;\n}\n\nimpl Trait for i32 {\n    fn foo<F>(&mut self, f: F)\n        where F: Clone + 'static\n    {   //               ^^^^^^^ additional requirement\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis is unsound and can permit crashes and other arbitrary behavior.\nThe solution is usually to move the requirement into the trait definition:\n\n``` rust\ntrait Trait {\n    fn foo<F>(&mut self, f: F)\n        where F: Clone + 'static;\n}\n```\n\nor else remove the requirement from the impl.\n#### When will this warning become a hard error?\n\nAt the beginning of each 6-week release cycle, the Rust compiler team will review the set of outstanding future compatibility warnings and nominate some of them for **Final Comment Period**. Toward the end of the cycle, we will review any comments and make a final determination whether to convert the warning into a hard error or remove it entirely.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37166/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 3, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37166/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
