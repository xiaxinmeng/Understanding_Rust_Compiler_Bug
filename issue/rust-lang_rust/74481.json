This is fairly common to try; `futures` does this extensively (#64193), as does `core`/`std` (#73423).\r\n\r\nOn one hand, this clearly breaks rust's scoping rules: inner crates can't refer to the types of their dependencies because it causes a cyclic dependency. So there's an argument to be made for saying this is just not supported.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this seems really useful. In fact it used to work for re-exports from the inner to outer crate, but only when you documented both crates at the same time, and the outer crate after the inner crate (this was #73699). So it would be great to find a way to make it work.\r\n\r\ncc @Manishearth, @Nemo157", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74481/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74481/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
