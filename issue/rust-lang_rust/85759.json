The issue is that there is a ton of dependencies (that I'd like to browse when needed), and my crates are drowned in the middle of those dependencies in the side panel.\r\n\r\nIt's impossible to see in a glance which crates are in the project, and thus to browse the project correctly.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI think that the crates from the workspace should come first if the side panel, and then the dependencies. If there are 2 crates `foo` and `bar` in the workspace, the panel should looks like that:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCRATES\r\n---------\r\nbar\r\nfoo\r\n---------\r\nall\r\nthe\r\ndependencies\r\n```", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85759/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85759/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
