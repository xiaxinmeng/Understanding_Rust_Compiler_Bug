Rust TCP server starts listening to port 4050.\r\n2. A connection is made from netcat to this port which is successful.\r\n3. netcat sends a payload which is successfully read by the server. At this point the server sleeps for 5 seconds (this is to give us time to close netcat)\r\n4. We close netcat which sends a `FIN,ACK` to the server. The server responds with an `ACK`. At this point the connection should be closed.\r\n5. After sleeping for 5 seconds, the connection handler resumes and writes to this tcp stream, *this should raise an error* because the connection has been closed (the server has even returned an ACK). However, at this point no errors are returned. On the TCP layer, a packet is pushed to the consumer and the OS returns a RST (because netcat is dead)\r\n\r\nI have uploaded 2 screenshots. The first which shows the execution of this program.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43916/153892224-1bc38a66-1a79-4770-a2de-7152506ca31e.png)\r\n\r\nHere is the image containing the TCP traffic from wireshark.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43916/153892291-deac4019-b7fc-4a50-97ae-ff82a6038fcc.png)\r\n\r\nHere is the code for the example client handler.
