If that read returns `Ok(0)` then it avoids unnecessarily doubling the capacity of the input buffer.\r\n\r\n> I think there'd be some value in trying to eliminate even the \"probe buffer\" call, but in the meantime, this seems like an improvement.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @joshtriplett in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89165#issuecomment-933081857_\r\n\r\nJosh, did you have something in mind?\r\n\r\nI thought a way: use [`read_vectored`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html#method.read_vectored). I could add the probe buffer to a vectorized `readv`, which would eliminate the extra `read` syscall.\r\n\r\n1. Is that idea worth pursuing?\r\n\r\n2. Is it okay to simply switch the `read` call(s) to `read_vectored`, or would it be better to check [`is_read_vectored`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html#method.is_read_vectored) and have separate vectorized and non-vectorized code paths? I'm inclined to keep it simple and do the former.", "closed_by": {"login": "jkugelman", "id": 4551859, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTE4NTk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4551859?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkugelman", "html_url": "https://github.com/jkugelman", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkugelman/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkugelman/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkugelman/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkugelman/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkugelman/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkugelman/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkugelman/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkugelman/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jkugelman/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/89516/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/89516/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
