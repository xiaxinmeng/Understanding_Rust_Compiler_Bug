In the bin program made by rust, I exported a function in the main unit, but I couldn't find the exported function with a third-party tool. I also use several other languages to do the same thing, and I can find the relevant exported functions. The function is simple in the following format:\r\n#[no_mangle]\r\npub extern \"C\" fn func1(data:String)->i32{}  \r\nMy final question is, does our Rust compile exe files that cannot export related export functions? This is the only language I have found that exe files cannot export functions.
