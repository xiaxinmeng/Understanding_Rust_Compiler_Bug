I dug a bit into the code and found the problem.  Basically, when the environment variable `TMPDIR` is not explicitly set, `rustpkg` uses `extra::tempfile::TempDir` to store temporary files.  `TempDir` by default operates in `/tmp`.\n\nLater, `rustpkg` does `fs::rename(&clone_target, local)`, in which `clone_target` and `local` are paths to different devices.  `libuv` (the default underlying IO library) seems unable to handle this case, therefore resulting in a \"cross-device link not permitted\" IO error.  The same error can also be reproduced with Node, as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4568689/how-do-i-move-file-a-to-a-different-partition-or-device-in-node-js).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "huonw", "id": 1203825, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDM4MjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1203825?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw", "html_url": "https://github.com/huonw", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11827/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11827/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
