You now have to put some thought into how best to format every case, whereas when braces were always required you didn't have any choices.\n\nThere are also some bracey expressions that don't follow the optional comma rule - records (which are going away), extensions written with braces, possibly structs (not sure how they're parsed). This makes it just a little bit more inconsistent.\n\nMaybe just making the choice for formatting arms between `=> expr,` and `=> { }` was the right balance after all.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3107/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3107/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
