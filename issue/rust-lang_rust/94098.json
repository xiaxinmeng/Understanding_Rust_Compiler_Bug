We recently noticed we'd been getting crash reports indicating Firefox crashes during `env_logger` initialization.  Upon debugging, we found out it was caused by a failure of `BCryptGenRandom`, that was introduced by #84096.\r\n\r\nAlmost all reports are from Windows 7 32-bit.  We don't know the reason why `BCryptGenRandom` failed.  Possibly the cryptography settings in the registry was corrupted and the process couldn't find the module.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this crash, can you add a fallback logic, using `RtlGenRandom` if `BCryptGenRandom` fails for whatever reason.  Probably we can limit it to Win7.\r\n\r\nHere's the link to the tracking bug in Bugzilla.\r\n\r\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1754490\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94098/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94098/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
