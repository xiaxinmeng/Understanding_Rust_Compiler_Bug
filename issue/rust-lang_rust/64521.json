I was doing some experimenting with Wasm callbacks and ran into 2 issues.\r\n\r\nThe code for the guest is compiled with Rust `1.37.0` on OSX with `--target=wasm32-unknown-unknown` and `--release`.\r\n\r\nedit: the first issue is no longer relevant; I misunderstood how function pointers were implemented.  By using the table to look up these values, I got it working!\r\n\r\n### The second issue\r\n\r\nWhile investigating this, I also found that the invalid solution of relying on the guest to offset correctly:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    // offset by 3 because we have 3 imports!\r\n    unsafe { call_guest_fn(test_callback as usize as u32 + 3) };\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\ncauses an LLVM error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n cargo build --release --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown\r\n   Compiling guest v0.1.0 (/Users/mark/Documents/temp/guest)\r\nLLVM ERROR: Function addresses with offsets not supported\r\nerror: Could not compile `guest`.\r\n\r\nTo learn more, run the command again with --verbose.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can clarify or help out with this!", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/64521/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/64521/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
