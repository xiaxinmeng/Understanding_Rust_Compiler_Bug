Things like:\n1. Keyword let declares a new binding - sort of linkage between name and value. \n   It has to be used ONLY when you want to introduce a new binding:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    x = 2; // this is an error\n}\n```\n1. You can have two or more bindings with the same name. The one declared \n   last will \"win\" (or shadow) over the previous one\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    let x = 2;\n    let x = 3; //no error here, from now on x is 3\n}\n```\n1. Each new binding can have its mutability independently declared, \n   even if it has the same name as one before\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n\n    let x = 2;\n    let mut x = 3; // from now on, x has value 3 and it can be changed\n\n}\n```\n\nThese things are simply not stressed enough in the book (or not mentioned at all) and understanding these things is the basis for understanding something  like this:\n\n``` rust\nlet x = 2; // this is immutable binding and from now on we can't modify x\nlet mut x = x; // but when we create a new mutable binding with the same name\nx = 3; //...then we can change x\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28177/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28177/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
