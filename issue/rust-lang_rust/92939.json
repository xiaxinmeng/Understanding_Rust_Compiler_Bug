In that\r\ncase, you can use use `issue = \"none\"` in your initial implementation PR. The\r\nreviewer will ask you to open a tracking issue if they agree your feature can be\r\nadded without an RFC.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFeature gate: `#![feature(windows_process_extensions_raw_arg)]`\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for the raw_arg extension to `std::process::Command` on Windows.\r\n\r\nWindows programs on the lowest API layers actually aren't required to accept arguments as an array of strings.\r\nIn fact the illusion that they do accept arguments as an array of strings is mostly maintained by one function. [CommandLineToArgvW](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-commandlinetoargvw). Not all programs use that function to parse arguments. Some of the programs that don't do this are really important, like `cmd.exe`. These programs instead read their argument as one large string, which makes them incompatible with how `std::process::Command::arg` passes the arguments. `std::process::Command::arg` assumes the program will parse the string using `CommandLineToArgvW`. Most of the time this is a reasonable assumption to make.\r\n\r\nSolution: `raw_arg`. Strings passed via `raw_arg` are sent straight through with no alteration, save for inserting spaces inbetween them. Raw args are not quoted, escaped, or really anything complicated like that. This makes them compatible with Windows executable files which don't use [CommandLineToArgvW](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-commandlinetoargvw).\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor most library features, it'd be useful to include a summarized version of the public API.\r\n(E.g. just the public function signatures without their doc comments or implementation.)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::process::Command;\r\n\r\n// This will print\r\n// \"Hello World!\"\r\n// with the quotes, which is not possible with std::process::Command and `cmd.exe`\r\n// with the current `.arg()` method.\r\nlet cmd = Command::new(\"cmd.exe\").raw_arg(\"/C echo \\\"Hello World!\\\"\");\r\n\r\n// You can also chain this\r\nCommand::new(\"cmd.exe\")\r\n        .raw_arg(\"/C\")\r\n        .raw_arg(\"echo\")\r\n        .raw_arg(\"\\\"Hello World!\\\"\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor larger features, more steps might be involved.\r\nIf the feature is changed later, please add those PRs here as well.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation: #85832\r\n- [x] Final comment period (FCP)\r\n- [x] Stabilization PR #92942\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOnce the feature has gone through a few release cycles and there are no\r\nunresolved questions left, the feature might be ready for stabilization.\r\n\r\nIf this feature didn't go through the RFC process, a final comment period\r\n(FCP) is always needed before stabilization. This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library API team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncomment period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- None yet.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "JohnTitor", "id": 25030997, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDMwOTk3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25030997?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnTitor", "html_url": "https://github.com/JohnTitor", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnTitor/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnTitor/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnTitor/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnTitor/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnTitor/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnTitor/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnTitor/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnTitor/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JohnTitor/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/92939/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/92939/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
