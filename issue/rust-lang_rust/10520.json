For example, the following function will\nfail to compile:\n\n```\n       fn mut_shift_ref<'a,T>(x: &mut &'a mut [T]) -> &'a mut T {\n           // `mut_split` will restrict mutation against *x:\n           let (head, tail) = (*x).mut_split(1);\n\n           // Hence mutating `*x` yields an error here:\n           *x = tail;\n           &mut head[0]\n       }\n```\n\nNote that this function -- which adjusts the slice `*x` in place so\nthat it no longer contains the head element and then returns a\npointer to that element separately -- is perfectly valid. It is\ncurrently implemented using unsafe code. I believe that now that\nthe swap operator is removed from the language, we could liberalize\nthe rules and make this function be accepted normally. The idea\nwould be to have the assignment to `*x` kill the loans of `*x` and\nits subpaths -- after all, those subpaths are no longer accessible\nthrough `*x`, since it has been overwritten with a new value. Thus\nthose subpaths are only accessible through prior existing borrows\nof `*x`, if any. The danger of the _swap_ operator was that it\nallowed `*x` to be mutated without making the subpaths of `*x`\ninaccessible: worse, they became accessible through a new path (I\nsuppose that we could have supported a swap operator, too, if needed, by moving the loans over to the new path).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10520/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10520/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
