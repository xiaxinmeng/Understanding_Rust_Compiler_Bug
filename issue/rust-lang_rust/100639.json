Simply deleting the /usr/src/rust/Cargo.toml file then rerunning x.py fixed all the issues and resulted in the desired outcome.\r\n\r\nAs I said I'm not completely sure what caused this but hopefully at least some good can come out of my mistake.\r\n\r\nMachine tested on: Gentoo Linux chroot i686 inside a Gentoo Linux x86_64 host.
