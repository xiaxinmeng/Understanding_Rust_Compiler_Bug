Wondering if it would be possible to publish tags for beta versions in the future.\r\n\r\nI don't particularly care about publishing a GitHub Release. Just a tag is fine, some sort of reference I can go to to look at the source code for beta versions.\r\n\r\nI was pointed to this tracker by @jyn514 :) TIA!", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100465/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100465/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
