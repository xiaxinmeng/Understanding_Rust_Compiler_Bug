Right now we just have to include that information outside of the code sample, but it can be easier to read (especially for people just looking at the example code) if it's included in the example itself. As such, I'm suggesting adding two more attributes to the doctests, `crate` and `file`. When actually running doctests, these are ignored, but when displaying in the output, are shown inside the example block.\r\n\r\nFor prior art, this is done a lot in hard print books. For example, page 5 of https://nostarch.com/download/samples/Realm_ch14.pdf shows the filename on the top right of the examples.\r\n\r\ncc @QuietMisdreavus @alercah @GuillaumeGomez ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53543/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53543/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
