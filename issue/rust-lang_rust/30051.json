It will fail, however, on 32-bit Windows (both GNU and MSVC toolchains). I'm not 100% sure that this is actually a codegen issue, but it's the only thing I can think of unfortunately.\n\nSpecifically, the assertion below will fail with some unusually corrupt value in `self.0` (e.g. it changes over time).\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo(u64);\nstruct Bar<T: ?Sized>(u32, T);\n\ntrait Trait {\n        fn foo(&self);\n}\n\nimpl Trait for Foo {\n        fn foo(&self) {\n                assert_eq!(self.0, 0);\n        }\n}\n\n\nfn main() {\n        let cursor = Foo(0);\n        let ar = Bar(32, cursor);\n        let ar: &Bar<Trait> = &ar;\n        ar.1.foo();\n}\n```\n\nThis may just be a dupe of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26403, but the failure _only_ on 32-bit Windows seems quite suspicious to me.
