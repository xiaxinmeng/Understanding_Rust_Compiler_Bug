I also tried building from rustc's clean source code but it fails when compiling llvm, before it gets to rust.\r\n\r\nThe machine was restarted in the meantime so I lost my terminal logs, but I'll try to run these again in the next few days and recover the exact error messages. It's a very slow machine. :(\r\n\r\nThe build works if I run it on a different machine, an armv8 with a 32-bit armv7 chroot.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "infinity0", "id": 78398, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc4Mzk4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78398?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/infinity0", "html_url": "https://github.com/infinity0", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/infinity0/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/infinity0/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/infinity0/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/infinity0/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/infinity0/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/infinity0/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/infinity0/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/infinity0/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/infinity0/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46748/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46748/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
