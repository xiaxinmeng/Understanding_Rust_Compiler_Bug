A better option would be to generate LLVM bytecode and run it with `lli`, but the version of LLVM provided by my Linux distribution (3.4) fails to run bytecode produced by Rust.\n\nIt seems that any user of the bytecode would need to build and install the LLVM used by Rust. Another issue is that it's currently a fork of upstream LLVM, so anything that requires the upstream LLVM on the same system may suffer compatibility problems in turn. It would be a better solution to build and install a `rust-lli` along with the compiler, at least until Rust can depend on a reasonably old stable version of the upstream LLVM.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18078/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18078/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
