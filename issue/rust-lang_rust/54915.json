I propose that when compiling in debug mode, we insert a check for this to emit a panic when the pointer is not sufficiently aligned. That would essentially be the \"big brother\" of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/52972, and the cousin of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53871.\r\n\r\nThis would have caught https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54908.\r\n\r\nHowever, I guess before someone starts implementing this, we should get @rust-lang/compiler to say that they think this is a good idea. It's in debug mode only, and it's a rather cheap check (as alignment is always a power of two), so I expect the perf impact to be acceptable.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54915/reactions", "total_count": 11, "+1": 11, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54915/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
