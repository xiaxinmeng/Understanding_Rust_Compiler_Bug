This is followed by a note indicating that the transitivity must also hold if `a`, `b`, and `c` are of different types.\r\n\r\nHowever, the last example implementation in the documentation is not transitive:\r\n```rust\r\nlet b1 = Book { isbn: 1, format: BookFormat::Paperback };\r\nlet b2 = Book { isbn: 2, format: BookFormat::Paperback };\r\n\r\nassert!(b1 == BookFormat::Paperback);\r\nassert!(BookFormat::Paperback == b2);\r\n\r\n// The following should hold by transitivity but doesn't.\r\nassert!(b1 == b2); // <-- PANICS\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can think of three possible ways to fix this:\r\n- Remove the last example.\r\n- Keep the last example as an explicit counterexample to warn how easy it is to accidentally write implementations that violate the contract.\r\n- Modify the last example in a way that fixes the issue (I'm not sure what that would look like).\r\n\r\nI can submit a pull request if I get some guidance which of the above solutions to choose (I personally have a weak preference for the second one).", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66476/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66476/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
