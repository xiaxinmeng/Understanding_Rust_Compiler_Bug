To start, this would work easily for std:\n\n```\n#[link(name = \"std\",\nvers = \"0.2\",\nuuid = \"122bed0b-c19b-4b82-b0b7-7ae8aead7297\",\nurl = \"https://github.com/mozilla/rust/tree/master/src/libstd\")];\n```\n\nBy taking the URL and appending the name of each source file you get valid pages:\n\nhttps://github.com/mozilla/rust/tree/master/src/libstd/arena.rs\nhttps://github.com/mozilla/rust/tree/master/src/libstd/bitv.rs\n\nIt's a bit more difficult for projects where the crate file is in the root directory:\n\n```\n#[link(name = \"glfw\",\nvers = \"0.1\",\nauthor = \"alegalle\",\nuuid = \"a1848f17-c60e-469d-8b12-8f1b45d2c31f\",\nurl = \"https://github.com/alegalle/rust_glfw\")];\n```\n\nNote the difference between the naively appended URL and the true URL:\n\nhttps://github.com/alegalle/rust_glfw/glfw.rs\nhttps://github.com/alegalle/rust_glfw/blob/master/glfw.rs\n\nEven if it means adding some Github-specific code, I think it would be worth it (especially since Github seems to be our \"blessed\" platform, and since rust_glfw registers the same URL with cargo-central, so Cargo must already be applying this transformation).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2072/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2072/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
