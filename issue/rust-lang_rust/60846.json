"#60444 has introduced a severe perf regression when building/testing the `conch-runtime` crate.\r\n\r\nPreviously a test run would take ~5 mins, and with the latest nightly (`rustc 1.36.0-nightly (372be4f36 2019-05-14)`) it now takes ~82(!!) mins.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/ipetkov/conch-runtime.git\r\n$ cd conch-runtime\r\n$ cargo test --lib\r\n   # snip\r\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 4m 16s\r\n$ cargo clean\r\n$ cargo +nightly test --lib\r\n   # snip\r\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 82m 54s\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\nCrate info\r\n</summary>\r\nThe crate offers the functionality to execute shell programs. Each piece of the grammar is represented as a node which can hold generic sub-nodes. The reasoning for this is so that the crate consumer could customize their AST with different/custom nodes, while reusing existing implementations.\r\n\r\nThe shell grammar is deeply recursive. Basically each command can vary in complexity (compound commands such as `case`, `for`, or simple commands like `echo foo`), but is ultimately made up of a list of shell words (literals, interpolations, etc.). Because each word can contain a command substitution, the AST type is recursive (a `Command<W>` has a `Word<C>` type, which gives us `Command<Word<Command<...>>`).\r\n\r\nThere are two \"top-level\" type definitions which seek to unify the entire AST tree concretely which are basically `TopLevelCommand(Command<TopLevelWord>)` `TopLevelWord(Word<TopLevelCommand>)`.\r\n\r\nThe crate also heavily uses generics and trait bounds (perhaps overly so), however, there's hopefully some low hanging fruits that can reduce the 16x slow down in performance.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\ncc @nikomatsakis @pnkfelix ", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60846/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60846/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
