The LLVM IR of crate B does not have the definition, only a declaration (because it was already instantiated for A). On the other hand, `identity_i32` is codegened twice and thus available for LLVM inlining.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nI would have expected that crate A gets its own copy of `identity::<i32>`. This would match the behavior of non-generic inline functions, and it would also enable more optimizations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/2253 (the proposed change would make it meaningful to annotate generic functions with `#[inline]`)\r\n\r\nI would try to create a PR for this if we can agree that the expected behavior is more reasonable.", "closed_by": {"login": "jachris", "id": 30163784, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTYzNzg0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30163784?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jachris", "html_url": "https://github.com/jachris", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jachris/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jachris/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jachris/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jachris/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jachris/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jachris/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jachris/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jachris/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jachris/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103499/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103499/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
