Additionally there are even some method references that start with a fullstop.\r\n\r\nI do not know what the policy is, but it appears (without thorough checks) to be so that the majority of references do _not_ use them. I'm not sure which way is best, but there should certainly be consistency.\r\n\r\nI'm doing a little work to try to fix those that I can find and will submit a PR shortly.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid that I can only afford to spend a little time right now removing parentheses from the handful of instances that use them. If a consensus were to develop that having them everywhere were more clear, that would have to be tackled separately later, by others if I cannot later find time for it.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79679/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79679/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
