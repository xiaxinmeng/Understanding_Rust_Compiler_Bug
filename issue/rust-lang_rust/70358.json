That has not made code more readable, and I am worried I might have missed some cases.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if enabling overflow checks for all of rustc is realistic, so it would be great if that could be controlled on a per-module level: if I could set something like `#![enable_overflow_checks]` in the interpreter modules, I could sleep much more soundly as I would be sure we'd not have silently overflowing arithmetic -- and I wouldn't have to make the code unreadable by turning `(x * 2) + 1` into `x.checked_mul(2).unwrap().checked_add(1).unwrap()`.\r\n\r\nOverflow checks are embedded into MIR, and it seems entirely possible to take module-level attributes into account during MIR building, so I think this is realistic.\r\n\r\n(I am not sure if this should go into this repo or the RFC repo, feel free to move around.)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/70358/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/70358/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
