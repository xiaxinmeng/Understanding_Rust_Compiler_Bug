The\nissue is that updates to the compiler may require updates to documentation, but\nit's not as simple as just updating a doc comment; you may need to:\n\n- Update the rustc-dev-guide\n- Update the unstable book\n- Update the reference\n- etc.\n\nThe goal for this first issue is to just add a check that would be run in CI to\nensure all feature gates have documentation in the unstable book. Quoting from\n@jyn514 on Zulip:\n\n> I think we should nibble at this a little at a time instead of trying to get a fully general solution, because the fully-general solution isn't possible without you specifying the dependencies yourself and I really hate that in build systems\n\nSee the relevant discussion [here](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/tool.20to.20keep.20docs.20up.20to.20date) on Zulip.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/78211/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/78211/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
