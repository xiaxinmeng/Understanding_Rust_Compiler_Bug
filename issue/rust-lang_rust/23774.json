This was done mostly because \n1. We suspect that many people will wind up using `Box<Error>`, especially once `Error` incorporated downcasting,\n2. We worried that, after setting up such APIs, people would end up wanting to send `Box<Error>` between threads and not be able to, and,\n3. We suspected that most errors would or could be made `Send` anyway.\n\nHowever, there are some cases in important libraries like Iron that involve non-`Send` errors, at least at the moment.\n\nWe need to make a final decision here. Should we instead require people to know about and use `Box<Error + Send>` when they need it?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/23774/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/23774/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
