(`... Or not to mutate a path?`)\r\n\r\n### Suggestions\r\nIn the 'Formal rules' section, the predicate notation used in the rest of the document is introduced:\r\n```text\r\nPREDICATE(X, Y, Z)                  // Rule-Name\r\n  Condition 1\r\n  Condition 2\r\n  Condition 3\r\n```\r\nAt first glance, this is trivial, but then this predicate is introduced:\r\n```text\r\nMUTABILITY(X, imm)                  // M-Var-Imm\r\n  DECL(X) = imm\r\n```\r\nI understood it as:\r\nSome of the conditions are actually the conditions in which the predicate is tested.\r\nIf `ARGUMENT` is actually a `value`, it is the same as adding the condition `ARGUMENT = value` to the predicate. \r\n\r\nI don't know if I was correct, or if this is a common notation (I don't know how to search for an explanation about a notation) but a clarification or a link to one would help.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38120/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38120/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
