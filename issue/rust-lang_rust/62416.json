However, most functions require their arguments to be properly aligned, and will explicitly state this requirement in their documentation. Notable exceptions to this are `read_unaligned` and `write_unaligned`.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly banking on the fact that every function is documented, but raw pointer dereference is a built-in operation and therefore has no documentation aside from the (previously mentioned) pointer primitive page.\r\n\r\nI checked [The Rust Programming Language, Second Edition](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html), one of the top google results (note: the google result is actually for 1.30.0). The string \"align\" does not appear.\r\n\r\nI checked [The Rust Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/pointer.html#raw-pointers-const-and-mut). Nothing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWith no mention of alignment *literally anywhere,* you would think: Surely it must not be required, then, right?\r\n\r\nWell, I checked the issue tracker, and according to [this issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54915) it sounds like alignment *is* required.", "closed_by": {"login": "RalfJung", "id": 330628, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDYyOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/330628?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung", "html_url": "https://github.com/RalfJung", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62416/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62416/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
