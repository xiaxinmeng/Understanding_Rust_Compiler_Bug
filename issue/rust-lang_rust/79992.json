If measured in isolation I assume the impact would be even greater. I expected the two to be equivalent.\r\n\r\nThe code being measured is day 11's parser: https://github.com/smmalis37/aoc2020/blob/3fbf5d9b9e89d18c213c0d9df6a08db9364b2604/src/days/day11.rs#L22. To replicate my results just clone that repo and run `cargo run --release 11` and look at the measured time of the parser (the rest of day 11 will be measured too but it isn't calling this code).", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79992/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79992/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
