Currently we have two \"schemes\"\n- Prefix the name with `__` [example](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/thread_local/mod.rs#L47-L54)\n- Liberal use of `#[doc(hidden)]` [example](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libcollections/vec.rs#L1256-L1278)\n\nIt would be nice to standardize on the convention here as most of these internals \"we'd really rather not expose\". I personally like the double-underscore-prefix-plus-`#[doc(hidden)]` strategy but others may feel differently!\n\nNominating, this may tidy up some of our apis in std.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pnkfelix", "id": 173127, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173127?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix", "html_url": "https://github.com/pnkfelix", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22607/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22607/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
