This is a good default, but rustdoc can also be useful to people working on large crates by documenting these crates themselves. In that case, it\u2019s preferable to also include private types, fields, functions, and methods.\n#15347 was about this use case, and was closed with this solution:\n\n```\nrustdoc --no-defaults --passes \"collapse-docs unindent-comments\"\n```\n\nWe just tried this on http://doc.servo.org/ . It\u2019s better than before, but has the unexpected side effect that every `use` item (including non-`pub` and the implicit prelude) and every `extern crate` (including the implicit `std`) is documented under \u201cReexports\u201d. It can get pretty noisy:\n\n![screenshot from 2015-07-18 13-11-44](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/291359/8761372/baaf6456-2d4e-11e5-8f91-14d16d1917ce.png)\n\nThey\u2019re technically part of the crate, but don\u2019t provide useful information. Could rustdoc split up the `strip-private` pass into one that strips private `use` and `extern crate`, and one for everything else?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27104/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27104/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
