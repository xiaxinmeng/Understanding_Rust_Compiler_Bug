We have many APIs which support the ability to search with any number of patterns generically within a string (e.g. substrings, characters, closures, etc), but implementing your own pattern (e.g. a regex) is not stable. It would be nice if these implementations could indeed be stable!\r\n\r\nSome open questions are:\r\n- Have these APIs been audited for naming and consistency?\r\n- Are we sure these APIs are as conservative as they need to be?\r\n- Are we sure that these APIs are as performant as they can be?\r\n- Are we sure that these APIs can be used to implement all the necessary forms of searching?\r\n\r\ncc @Kimundi \r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27721/reactions", "total_count": 21, "+1": 21, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27721/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
