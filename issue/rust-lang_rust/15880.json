These tests take a long time to run, as will the impending tests of the parser. We need to do a few things to turn them on:\n- Port grammar and lexer tests to rustbuild from grammar.mk\n- Add a `make check-extra` in `src/bootstrap/mk/makefile.in` that runs the grammar and lexer tests. Submit PR to rust-lang/rust\n- Create a Dockerfile that is capable of running the tests\n- Make modifications to rust-buildbot that a new `auto-extra` builder\n- Submit PR to rust-buildbot.\n\ncc @cmr @alexcrichton \n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15880/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15880/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
