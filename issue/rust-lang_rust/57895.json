"This is a tracking issue for the work items remaining for the NLL team before we can consider NLL stabilized across all editions (see also #43234).\r\n\r\nHere is an outline of the steps we have identified.\r\n\r\n * [x] Stage 1: Move all editions to NLL (#57804)\r\n    * Move Rust 2015 to borrowck=migrate\r\n    * Potential blockers:\r\n      * NLL-sound bugs that affect migration mode (vs ones that only arise with `#![feature(nll)]` today)\r\n      * Major diagnostic regressions that affect migration mode\r\n * [ ] Stage 2: Transition fully to NLL (#58781)\r\n   * one currently opts into this via `#![feature(nll)]` or `-Z borrowck=mir -Z two-phase-borrows`)\r\n   * this causes NLL warnings (downgraded from errors) become errors again\r\n     * possible intermediate steps\r\n       * move to deny-by-default lints for the warnings \r\n       * move 2018 to hard error on its own, leaving 2015 with downgrade-to-warnings\r\n   * It also gets rid of AST-region inference, causing some code to be accepted that is rejected by migrate mode.\r\n   * Potential blockers: \r\n     * NLL-sound bugs that affect NLL mode without migration\r\n     * Major diagnostic regressions\r\n     * Two-phase borrows (2PB) question or other \"unsettled questions\" must have some conservative answer in place\r\n     * Crater run showing no major crates fail in practice\r\n * [x] Stage 3: remove old AST-borrowck (done in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64790)\r\n\r\n### Blocking issues\r\n\r\n* [ ] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73154\r\n* [x] #57642 \r\n* [x] #59159",
