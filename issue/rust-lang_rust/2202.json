Generally, the only new language features added after this milestone must be backwards compatible, or to fix soundness holes, though we do expect to have some leeway to make small incompatible fixes that have low impact on existing code bases.\r\n\r\n* Library stability - We have a system of measuring and ensuring the stability of API's, and a significant portion of the standard library is declared stable. Stable API's will not change. Large portions of the standard library need to be stable for 1.0, including primitive types, vectors, strings, option, numerics, collections, some I/O and concurrency.\r\n\r\n* User experience - The system is polished and the presentation is complete and professional. New users have a clear path to using and learning the system. This encompasses the web site, documentation, installation, and tooling.\r\n", "creator": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 376, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2013-10-10T18:48:33Z", "updated_at": "2016-08-28T23:13:24Z", "due_on": "2015-05-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2015-05-21T20:59:13Z"}, "comments": 29, "created_at": "2012-04-14T16:35:10Z", "updated_at": "2014-06-12T22:46:07Z", "closed_at": "2014-06-12T21:09:46Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "**UPDATE:**\n\nThis is a meta-bug now for tracking the work on completing closures. Now that #6801 has landed, the remaining pieces of work are:\n- Issue #3696: Define region hierarchy for closures\n- Issue #10553: We should not be accepting `'a ||` as syntax\n- Issue #8622: Unboxed closures -- for the purposes of #2202, just having a design and ensuring our treatment of closures is compatible with it is enough.\n- Issue #12224: Calling a closure is a kind of borrow.\n- Issue #13621: Explain closures much better in the tutorial \n\n**ORIGINAL FOLLOWS:**\nWe need to revamp function types in light of regions.  I think `fn()` (the \"any\" function) will go away, and `fn@()` and `fn~()` will be coercable to `fn&()`, just as with poiners/vectors/slices/etc.  Also, `fn&()` becomes `fn&r()` (that is, r is a region), though the user won't typically need to write it.  We can probably leave the representation as is, though we could also tweak `fn&()` to not have a ref count since there will be an explicit borrowing that occurs.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pnkfelix", "id": 173127, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173127?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix", "html_url": "https://github.com/pnkfelix", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2202/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2202/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
