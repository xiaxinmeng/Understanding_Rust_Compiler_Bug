This is related to these issues in the [new book repo]()\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/book/issues/181\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/book/issues/235 \n- https://github.com/rust-lang/book/issues/236\n\nBut since this issue has to do with what happens to the current (old) version of the book, I'm filing it in this repo where this book lives. \n\nThis issue is for deciding between a bunch of possibilities for the current book. I'm happy to make more issues if these decisions should be split into other issues at any time, or for actually doing the work once we decide what work should be done.\n\nPossibilities to discuss:\n- We would like if at all possible to leave the current book at its current URLs so that links to it don't break.\n  - What does that mean for the URLs for the new book? \n  - Should we have a version in the URLs?\n  - Should the old book's URLs redirect to different URLs, say, `/v1/`?\n  - Should there be a banner on old book URLs saying \"You are reading an outdated version of the book, you may want to try the new book\"?\n  - Should we automatically redirect old book URLs to the new book, and have a banner offering a link back to the old book?\n- Should the old book stay in rust-lang/rust or get its own repo too?\n- Should the old book continue to be shipped with rust installations for offline reading?\n- When should these transitions take place? When the new book is complete or sooner, or should we have a transition period with both? \n- Should we ever stop making the old book available?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36094/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36094/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
