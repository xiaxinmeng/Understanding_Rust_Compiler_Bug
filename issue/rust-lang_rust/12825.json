Generally, the only new language features added after this milestone must be backwards compatible, or to fix soundness holes, though we do expect to have some leeway to make small incompatible fixes that have low impact on existing code bases.\r\n\r\n* Library stability - We have a system of measuring and ensuring the stability of API's, and a significant portion of the standard library is declared stable. Stable API's will not change. Large portions of the standard library need to be stable for 1.0, including primitive types, vectors, strings, option, numerics, collections, some I/O and concurrency.\r\n\r\n* User experience - The system is polished and the presentation is complete and professional. New users have a clear path to using and learning the system. This encompasses the web site, documentation, installation, and tooling.\r\n", "creator": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 376, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2013-10-10T18:48:33Z", "updated_at": "2016-08-28T23:13:24Z", "due_on": "2015-05-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2015-05-21T20:59:13Z"}, "comments": 12, "created_at": "2014-03-11T11:17:42Z", "updated_at": "2014-10-16T00:02:32Z", "closed_at": "2014-10-16T00:02:32Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Previously to #12491, there were no real issues with the current method lookup implementation, which collects candidates and picks the first one in the auto-deref chain, without caring too much about mutability.\n\nThe problematic case #12491 introduces was `(*x).foo()` where `*x` is an overloaded dereference, calling either `Deref::deref` or `DerefMut::deref_mut`.\n\nHowever, the method could take `&mut self` - which we can't know until we've picked one of `deref` or `deref_mut` and continued to the lookup of `.foo`.\n\nThe choice I've made was to always try `deref_mut` (if not obviously immutable, e.g. x having a type of `&T` instead of `&mut T` or `T`) first, and that will work for `RefCell`'s `RefMut`, which only had a mutable `.get()` method previously.\n\nIn #12610 it gets worse as the issue can happen at any auto-deref level, and here's a test case that fails to compile:\n\n``` rust\n// Generic unique/owned smaht pointer.\nstruct Own<T> {\n    value: *mut T\n}\n\nimpl<T> Deref<T> for Own<T> {\n    fn deref<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a T {\n        unsafe { &*self.value }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<T> DerefMut<T> for Own<T> {\n    fn deref_mut<'a>(&'a mut self) -> &'a mut T {\n        unsafe { &mut *self.value }\n    }\n}\n\nstruct Point {\n    x: int,\n    y: int\n}\n\nimpl Point {\n    fn get(&self) -> (int, int) {\n        (self.x, self.y)\n    }\n}\n\nfn test(x: Own<Point>) {\n    // This method call will attempt a deref_mut call, which succeeds\n    // (because type checking doesn't have the mem_categorization\n    // information borrow checking uses to confirm the sanity of such\n    // borrows), but causes a borrow error later.\n    // Ideally, auto-deref should recognize x as immutable and call\n    // deref instead of deref_mut` Also, method lookup could use\n    // the self type of the method to pick deref instead of deref_mut.\n    let _ = x.get();\n}\n```\n\ncc @nikomatsakis\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12825/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12825/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
