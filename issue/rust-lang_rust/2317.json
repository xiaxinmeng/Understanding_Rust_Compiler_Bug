Boxes are for dynamic allocation only.\n\nI believe issues #1272, #1417, #571 and #570 all relate to this and should probably be merged into this one. I think the correct course of action is to define two subsets of the expression language:\n- Constant expressions (a subset of expressions)\n- Integer-constant expressions (a subset of constant expressions)\n\nThe compiler should have a pass that classifies each expression as either dynamic, constant, or integer-constant, based on its operators and operands.\n\nOnly constant expressions should be legal initializers for a `const` item. The compiler back-end can evaluate constant expressions to read-only memory using the LLVM constant instuctions.\n\nThe compiler _front-end_ can evaluate integer-constant expressions, in order to deduce array bounds, structure sizes, enumeration discriminators and similar \"size-like\" values. This is what we're currently using `eval_const_expr` for (in bug #1417) and it should be rigorously defined as part of the language. In particular, we might in the future permit integer-constant expressions to show up inside portions of the type grammar (particularly relating to constant sizes given for arrays).\n\nThe compiler back-end should arrive at the exact same integer values as the front-end did, when translating an integer-constant expression.\n\nWe may also wish to look into a form of `const fn` as in C++0x `constexpr` functions. At this point I think it's effectively already reserved syntax for us so we can punt for now.\n\nIt may also be useful to add sizeof(), alignof(), and similar \"built-in\" constant functions implemented using compiler intrinsics.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "graydon", "id": 14097, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDk3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14097?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon", "html_url": "https://github.com/graydon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2317/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2317/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
