Such two examples have inconsistent behaviors.  For the second case, they are two issues \r\n> 1. The lifetime parameter seems not to be a constant value after the initialization at `#1`(i.e. it didn't keep the value of lifetime inferred at that point). It seems that the value can be changed at `#2` and turned into a shorter lifetime, which results in `#4` is an error. Unlike the first case, the lifetime of the field keeps not change once we specify the lifetime parameter.\r\n\r\n> 2. From observing `#3` and `#4`, the value of the lifetime will be narrowed when we assign the reference with a shorter lifetime, and subsequently, the value cannot turn to longer even though we instead assign the reference with a longer lifetime value. \r\n\r\nThese are two obscure points. It should make sense that the access to `v.d` at `#4` is valid since we have changed the reference value at `#3` to make it refers to `i` that is valid at `#4`. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/99896/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/99896/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
