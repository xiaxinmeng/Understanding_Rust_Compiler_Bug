We've got a few locations, to place it (e.g. on the binding or in the type of a reference), and this can be confusing when you're just starting out. As a specific case, consider:\n\n``` rust\npub fn foo(mut a: &String)  {\n    a.push_str(\"foo\");\n}\n```\n\nwhich when compiled yields the error message:\n\n```\nerror: cannot borrow immutable borrowed content `*a` as mutable\n --> foo.rs:2:5\n  |\n2 |     a.push_str(\"foo\");\n  |     ^\n\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n```\n\nTo a beginner this can be quite confusing because `a` _is_ mutable, but the fix here is to take `&mut String`, not `&String`. Perhaps we can detect this and provide a more tailored error message for cases like this?\n\ncc @jonathandturner \n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36412/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36412/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
