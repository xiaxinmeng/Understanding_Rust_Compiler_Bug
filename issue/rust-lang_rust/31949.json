For example, I need a bloom filter that supports efficient union operations. Iff two bloom filters have equal hashers and size, union is as easy as bitwise OR the filters together.\n\nWhile we're at it, might as well derive some other traits too. Hash would be useful. Ord maybe, though possible, it doesn't make that much sense other than for storing SipHashers in a BTree or the like.\n\nThis is technically a change to the standard library, though a very minor one, so does it need an RFC or should I just make a pull request?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mpdn", "id": 448023, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODAyMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448023?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mpdn", "html_url": "https://github.com/mpdn", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mpdn/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mpdn/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mpdn/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mpdn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mpdn/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mpdn/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mpdn/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mpdn/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mpdn/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31949/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31949/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
