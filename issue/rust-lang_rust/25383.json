The code below does not compile with the latest nightly (rustc 1.1.0-nightly (c2b30b86d 2015-05-12) (built 2015-05-13)) because client doesn't last long enough:\n\n```\nmatch client.get(&format!(\"http://api.zippopotam.us/us/{}\", candidate)).send() {\n    Ok(mut res) => Ok((candidate, read_response(&mut res))),\n    _ => Err(ZipError::API),\n}\n```\n\nOf course, client isn't being returned... The return value is a pair of owned strings or an enum value, depending on the result from the client's `send()` operation. (I doubt any of this is relevant.)\n\nThe simplest fix for this (courtesy of /u/stebalien at /r/rust) is to add return:\n\n```\nreturn match client.get(&format!(\"http://api.zippopotam.us/us/{}\", candidate)).send() {\n    Ok(mut res) => Ok((candidate, read_response(&mut res))),\n    _ => Err(ZipError::API),\n};\n```\n\nSince the two should be equivalent, /u/stebalien characterized this as being a regression. (Again, I'm clueless.)\n\nFull code for this program (unfortunately, I am not cool enough to be able to pare this down to the bare minimum for anything so subtle) is available [here](https://github.com/archer884/zip/commit/b2a59f259f750e6ee1173b23cee0801c4e33b8b7).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "archer884", "id": 679494, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTQ5NA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/679494?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/archer884", "html_url": "https://github.com/archer884", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/archer884/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/archer884/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/archer884/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/archer884/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/archer884/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/archer884/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/archer884/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/archer884/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/archer884/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25383/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25383/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
