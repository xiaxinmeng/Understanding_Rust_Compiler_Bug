For `32/64` bit tests we ended up adding a postfix to the file name (which comes after the `.diff`), and that breaks the tool support. We should change all these tests file-names so they end with `.diff` again.\r\n\r\nWe should change both https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5fff3824bc77cd7052e2515f82259e32f8ad1486/src/tools/compiletest/src/runtest.rs#L3172 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5fff3824bc77cd7052e2515f82259e32f8ad1486/src/tools/compiletest/src/runtest.rs#L3190 to insert the `bitsize` before the `.diff` or `.mir` respectively.\r\n\r\nAfter you've run `--bless` for both 32 bit and 64 bit, you also need to change https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5fff3824bc77cd7052e2515f82259e32f8ad1486/src/tools/compiletest/src/runtest.rs#L3147 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5fff3824bc77cd7052e2515f82259e32f8ad1486/src/tools/compiletest/src/runtest.rs#L3152 \r\n\r\nDo not do the last step before having run `--bless`, otherwise you'll have to figure out what files to rename and do it manually. This way you get `--bless` to do it for you.\r\n\r\ncc @rust-lang/wg-mir-opt ", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75746/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75746/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
