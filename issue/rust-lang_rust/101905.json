I have following code:\r\n```rust\r\n#[async_trait]\r\ntrait AsyncFnOnce<Args> {\r\n    type Output;\r\n\r\n    async fn call(mut self, args: Args) -> Self::Output;\r\n}\r\n\r\npub struct AsyncDefer<F: AsyncFnOnce()> // <--- compiler error\r\n{\r\n\tfunc: Option<F>,\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI wonder if there is a way to either somehow bypass this compiler error or implement what i want with async defer. please share your thoughs.\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "GOVYANSONG", "id": 36177352, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTc3MzUy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36177352?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/GOVYANSONG", "html_url": "https://github.com/GOVYANSONG", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GOVYANSONG/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GOVYANSONG/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GOVYANSONG/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GOVYANSONG/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GOVYANSONG/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GOVYANSONG/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GOVYANSONG/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GOVYANSONG/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GOVYANSONG/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/101905/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/101905/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
