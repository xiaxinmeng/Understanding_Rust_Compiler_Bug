I propose that all these functions return a Result, as this more closely matches the semantics of Option and Result.  Option is generally used where Some() or None are _both_ valid return values.  Result is used where Ok() is a valid value and Err() means the function could not perform as desired.  The latter more closely matches common use of from_utf8 (we expect this buffer to be a utf8 string, but need to confirm it before turning it into a str or String, and something has gone wrong if it's not utf8).  Running through the rust compiler source code, it's almost exclusively used in this fashion: virtually all cases are followed immediately by a .unwrap(), panicking the task if the buffer was not utf-8.\n\nExactly what the Result's Err() variant should hold, I do not know.  It seems that it should return a proper FromError-style enum with a variant like UtfDecodeError, but I do now know how many different error enums we want in the standard library.  I leave it to someone else to decide what's most useful and elegant.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18888/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18888/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
