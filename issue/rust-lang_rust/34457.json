Let's package it with Rust. This will have lots of advantages:\n- All major platforms will get the same debugging experience\n- Debuging will be more reliable because users have the exact debugger we've actually tested with our toolchain\n- By controlling the producer and consumer of our DWARF we can evolve it quickly, move to Rust-specific DWARF\n\nSteps:\n- Set up a fork in rust-lang-nursery\n- Modify it to produce a gdb with a Rust-specific name\n- Set up CI and packaging for gdb\n- Modify rust-buildbot / rust-packaging to add gdb to the manifest as an optional component\n- Figure out the best user experience for obtaining gdb via rustup\n\ncc @michaelwoerister  @rust-lang/tools What you think?\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34457/reactions", "total_count": 9, "+1": 9, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34457/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
