In short it seams the musl `std` crate is build during `make all` but not installed in the subsequent `make install`. Manually copying the rlibs from the build directory solves the issue and rustc is able to build for the `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` target.\r\n\r\nI wonder if that is an issue of the build system or me using it.\r\n\r\nThe longer story is on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42192850/how-do-i-build-the-rust-standard-library-with-a-custom-musl).\r\n\r\nMy build environment is [here](https://github.com/fzgregor/docker-rust-musl).\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39809/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39809/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
