Per @eddyb's comment in #36151, this is likely to be because all files on the Windows filesystem are exposed with permissions 777.\n\nWe can detect that a system is likely to be WSl by checking `/proc/version` for the string `Microsoft`.  should Microsoft ever change this file to not use this string, the worst that happens here is a regression.  It is possible that other Linux systems include the string `Microsoft` in `/proc/version`, but this seems unlikely.\n\nThe specific problem here is twofold: `make tidy` prints `binary checked into source` for every single file in the repository, and `make check` refuses to run because `make tidy` fails.  I'm not familiar enough with the Rust build system to even begin to attempt to fix this myself.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36706/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36706/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
