I'm an English teacher in Turkey. I have a translation team which consist of 7 English teachers. And we will be rewarded for each of 1100 words translations from Github. And for that our translations have to be approved by the project after we pull request the translations we made. We can translate your whole project in Turkish if you give permission to us. So please give this project to us and you will see we won't let you down. After we fork the file we will translate and send you a pull request for you to check and approve our translation. I can assure you our work will be satisfying.
