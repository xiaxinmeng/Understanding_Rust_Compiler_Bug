On Linux, we're getting a new [high performance async io implementation called io_uring](https://lwn.net/Articles/776703/). I'm curious how Rust is going to be able to interface with this, & how is this going to work with Rust's async/await plans?\r\n\r\nI'm afraid my knowledge of Rust's async/await isn't up to par to do much guesswork for how Linux's async io would fit into Rust's async language features. I'm hoping someone around these parts might be willing to take a look & report back with your thoughts on feasibility, and how Rust might leverage Linux's high performance async io mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe maintainer @axboe also has a very nice [PDF write-up of io_ring](http://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf) (which he announced [here](https://mobile.twitter.com/axboe/status/1114568873800491009)).
