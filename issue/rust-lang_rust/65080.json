If we care that people continue to write macros using tokens, the performance needs to be better.\r\n\r\nI minimized the slow part of the num_enum macro to this benchmark:\r\nhttps://github.com/alexcrichton/proc-macro2/tree/12bac84dd8d090d2987a57b747c7ae7bbeb8a3d0/benches/bench-libproc-macro\r\nOn my machine the string implementation takes 8ms and the token implementation takes 25721ms.\r\n\r\nI know that there is a proc macro server that these calls end up talking to, but I wouldn't expect this huge of a factor from that. If the server calls are the only thing making this slow, is there maybe a way we could buffer operations in memory to defer and batch the server work?\r\n\r\nI will file issues in proc-macro2 and quote as well to see if anything can be improved on their end.\r\n\r\nFYI @eddyb @petrochenkov @alexcrichton ", "closed_by": {"login": "dtolnay", "id": 1940490, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDA0OTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1940490?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay", "html_url": "https://github.com/dtolnay", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/65080/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 1, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 2}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/65080/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
