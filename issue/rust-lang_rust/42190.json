Working with includes is a little painful right now because `#[cfg(no_std)]` doesn't seem to work.\r\n\r\nAs an example, I'd expect the following code to work both with and without no_std (commenting out the first line. Instead, it doesn't work as written below (but will work if you comment out `no_std`.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#![no_std]\r\n\r\n#[cfg(no_std)]\r\nuse core::mem;\r\n#[cfg(not(no_std))]\r\nuse std::mem;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let x: u32 = unsafe { mem::uninitialized() };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see the following error:\r\n```shell\r\nerror[E0432]: unresolved import `std::mem`\r\n --> <anon>:6:5\r\n  |\r\n6 | use std::mem;\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^ Maybe a missing `extern crate std;`?\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my crate I'd like to do things like keep `println!()` in my crate for testing during development, but have them work during testing. And also configure the entire module to be `no_std` when not testing using `#![cfg_attr(not(test), no_std)]`. Neither of these work because of the current situation.\r\n\r\ncc @japaric This is something I mentions in your users forum thread about embedded dev.", "closed_by": {"login": "Susurrus", "id": 206363, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjM2Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/206363?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Susurrus", "html_url": "https://github.com/Susurrus", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Susurrus/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Susurrus/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Susurrus/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Susurrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Susurrus/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Susurrus/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Susurrus/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Susurrus/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Susurrus/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42190/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42190/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
