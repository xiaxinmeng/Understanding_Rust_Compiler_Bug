When I installed it I ran into errors compiling a simple hello world test program. The compiler said it could not find the core library. Upon investigation, I found that the installer had not properly set the permissions of the core library folders. I needed to manually set the permissions away from only allowing root to access the libraries to allowing everyone to access the libraries. In code:\n\n```\nchmod g+rx,o+rx /usr/local/lib/rustc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nchmod g+rx,o+rx /usr/local/lib/rustc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib\n```\n\nThe commands to build were:\n\n```\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\nEdit: Later today I tried reinstalling with git master (last time I had used the 0.6 release version), and realized that I had accidentally omitted one of the libraries with the incorrect permissions. I had also had to have done:\n\n```\nchmod g+rx,o+rx /usr/local/lib/rustc\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mstewartgallus", "id": 4070335, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzAzMzU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4070335?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mstewartgallus", "html_url": "https://github.com/mstewartgallus", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mstewartgallus/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mstewartgallus/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mstewartgallus/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mstewartgallus/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mstewartgallus/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mstewartgallus/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mstewartgallus/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mstewartgallus/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mstewartgallus/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/5742/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/5742/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
