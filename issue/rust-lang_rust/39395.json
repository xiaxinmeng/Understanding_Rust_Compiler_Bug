I just started to study Rust yesterday, but a while ago i have passed for some troubles. I was trying to make some code to test myself if i really learned something from the yesterday night that i passed reading and writing the code from the Rust book that the development team provides. All i did was write a code that reads the user input after a \"print!\" command (sorry, i don't remember the right term for that), and after that, shows the user input after a \"println!\" command. But, i've just noticed something. When i write the code this way, the Terminal waits for the user input in the beginning of the code, what was not supposed to happen. But, this just don't happen when i use the \"println!\" command, instead of the \"print!\". The terminal prints the words that it was supposed to print, and then waits for the user input.\r\n\r\nI've recorded a video to explain, and i'm about to update it on YouTube, just in a moment.\r\n\r\n(sorry if i made some mistake while writing, english is not my mother language :) )", "closed_by": {"login": "ericsantosbr", "id": 10171110, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTcxMTEw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10171110?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ericsantosbr", "html_url": "https://github.com/ericsantosbr", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ericsantosbr/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ericsantosbr/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ericsantosbr/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ericsantosbr/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ericsantosbr/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ericsantosbr/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ericsantosbr/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ericsantosbr/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ericsantosbr/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39395/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39395/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
