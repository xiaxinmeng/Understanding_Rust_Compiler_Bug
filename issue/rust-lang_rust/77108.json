It's a well-made documentation system. However, adding to the documentation from code can be difficult. Here's an example.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n/// Here's my documentation.\r\n/// It looks very cool.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, really long documentation pages can be borderline unreadable in the source code. Instead, I would like to propose the addition of comment blocks for documentation. From a personal standpoint, block comments are easier to read in source when there's a multi-line comment. Here's an example using `//*`\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n//*\r\n   * Here's my documentation.\r\n   * It looks very cool.\r\n*//\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though most IDEs already auto-format `///` for comments, I'd at least like the option to add a doc comment block for editors that do not auto-add `///` rather than being forced to type out single-line comments.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate feedback as needed and if you are not keen on using block comments, can you please tell me why?
