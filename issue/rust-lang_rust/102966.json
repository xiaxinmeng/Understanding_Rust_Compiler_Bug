It sits on 100% CPU doing rustc_middle things inside a `rustc_typeck::outlives::implicit_infer::infer_predicates > insert_outlives_predicate` operation. (**Edit**: by \"rustc_middle things\" I mean `<rustc_middle::ty::TyS as core::cmp::Ord>::cmp`.) I've let it run for at least half an hour to no avail.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nstruct Node<'a, G: NodeGenerics<'a>> {\r\n    kind: Kind<'a, G>,\r\n}\r\n\r\nenum Kind<'a, G: NodeGenerics<'a>> {\r\n    Empty,\r\n    Var(Var<'a, G::R>),\r\n}\r\n\r\ntrait NodeGenerics<'a> {\r\n    type R: 'a;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct RGen<T>(std::marker::PhantomData<T>);\r\nimpl<'a, T: 'a> NodeGenerics<'a> for RGen<T> {\r\n    type R = T;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct Var<'a, R: 'a> {\r\n    node: Box<Node<'a, RGen<R>>>,\r\n    _phantom: std::marker::PhantomData<R>,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can change the code in a couple of small ways such that it won't hang.\r\n\r\n1. Remove the \"carrier trait\" NodeGenerics, replace it with `T: 'a` and use `T` instead of `G::R`. You would think that adding a carrier trait with the same bounds would not really change anything. But it does. (In my code, NodeGenerics has a bunch of different types attached to it, which are used in many different arms of `Kind`. It makes everything a lot neater.)\r\n2. Changing `RGen<T>` to just `RGen` and its implementation of `NodeGenerics` to have a constant `type R = ()`.\r\n3. Don't use lifetimes at all, put `'static` bounds in everywhere instead, i.e. make NodeGenerics take `type R: 'static`.\r\n\r\nI don't know why it's hanging on this, but rustc should never hang, so there you go.
