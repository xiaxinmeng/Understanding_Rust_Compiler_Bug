Errors are _bubbled up_ to `main()` using the `std::error::Error` and `std::error::FromError` traits.  This allows most user messaging to occur in a central location (especially panic-level failures), simplifying testing and internationalization.\n\nOne issue I have encountered has to do with missing environment variables.  `std::env::VarError` does not capture the the environment variable name (which std::env calls a _key_); therefore, the messages from `Error::description()` and `Display::fmt()` do not tell the user which environment variable is missing.  To work around this issue, I have wrapped `VarError` in another struct.  It would be much simpler if `VarError` captured the environment variable name and included it in the messages.\n\nI realize this is likely to require heap allocation to save a copy of the name.  In most (sane) cases, environment variables are accessed once during program initialization and the value stored for future use.  Therefore, I believe the benefit of knowing which environment variable is missing outweighs the heap allocation cost.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22122/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22122/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
