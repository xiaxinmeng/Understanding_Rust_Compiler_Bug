The `llvm-project` directory does not exist in the `rust/src` directory and `libunwind` won't build due to that. @RalfJung might have pinned the problem down to [a PR](https://github.com/japaric/xargo/issues/281#issuecomment-596451233). The `llvm-project` directory is required to build `libunwind` and for the Rust project is provided as a submodule.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\n\r\n@RalfJung [thinks](https://github.com/japaric/xargo/issues/281#issuecomment-596583780) a solution might be adding the `llvm-project` directory to the list of src paths that will make into the `rust-src` component, but it is not clear if that's the right solution. I am also not sure that's the right way as the directory is quite large.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n<!-- Any additional context or information you feel may be relevant to the issue. -->\r\nSorry if I might have misinterpreted your words, @RalfJung, I did not intend to.
