It can refer to definitions in the crate currently being compiled or to definitions in other crates. There are quite a few places in the compiler which will only work if passed a local `DefId`--maybe they need to access the HIR for that definition, which is only available in the current crate--but accept `DefId` as a parameter. These places should use `LocalDefId` instead.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this issue, you need to find functions or methods that will panic if a `DefId` is not local. Such places should be calling [`DefId::expect_local`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/def_id/struct.DefId.html#method.expect_local) and then working with the returned `LocalDefId`, but you are more likely to see older idioms (e.g., `tcx.as_local_hir_id(def_id).unwrap()`). Code like this should be refactored to take a `LocalDefId` instead of a `DefId` and their caller made responsible for asserting that a given `DefId` is local. The end goal is to move the call to `expect_local` as high up in the call graph as we can. If possible, it should be the first thing we do when executing a query like so, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/40158901d5c7e65b2fb5adc6ce186bc308274954/src/librustc_mir/const_eval/fn_queries.rs#L174\r\n\r\nIdeally this would be done module-by-module so it can be reviewed more easily (not in a single, giant PR). See the last commit in #66132 for prior art.\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\nThis issue has been assigned to @marmeladema via [this comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70853#issuecomment-610644204).\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"marmeladema\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": {"login": "ecstatic-morse", "id": 29463364, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDYzMzY0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29463364?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse", "html_url": "https://github.com/ecstatic-morse", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/70853/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/70853/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
