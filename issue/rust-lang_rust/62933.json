Testing this is easy and takes very little CI time: once the toolchain has been build, just loop over all the targets that the rustc binary supports trying to build `libcore` with it. Building libcore for ~50 targets takes a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\nThe libc crate does that for stable and nightly toolchains here ([build.sh](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/blob/master/ci/build.sh)). It might be possible to adapt that to rustc's CI. \r\n\r\nRegressing on being able to build libcore for some target is not something that should land on beta, much less on stable Rust.
