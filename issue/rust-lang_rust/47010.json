E.g., you can put inherent methods on both, and call them distinctly. I've a full example of this [here](https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=6480849426c41c569886223d742b582c&version=nightly).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is already in stable Rust, but at the same time, I don't think anybody is actually relying on this corner of the language. It should be an error to have the same trait twice in a trait object (except perhaps via generics), or at least make cases like `Send1` and `Send2` be equivalent.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47010/reactions", "total_count": 8, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 4, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47010/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
