I am here to inquire about the possibility of having a second book that includes verbose examples.  I know fn main() was left out of the examples for readability but if each example was syntactically complete I could spend a lot less time wondering what is what since a compile-able example of the feature being explained would allow me to tinker and be fully immersed instead of getting just a gist of it.\n\nIf someone is willing to proof my work I am willing to do the lions share of what I'm asking for, if this is a \"bad idea\", that's ok with me too.  I also think a link to the nightly reference should be one of the first things you find in the book, I didn't know it existed until I heard about it in #rust-offtopic.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28630/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28630/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
