I.e., DST values may not be l-values.\n\nThe following should be illegal:\n\n```\nfn g<type X>(x: X) {...}\nfn f(x: ~[T]) {\n    let y = *x; //~ERROR lvalue is dynamically sized\n    g(*x); //~ERROR lvalue is dynamically sized\n}\n```\n\nI think we can enforce this by preventing storage locations having DST, rather than checking de-references.\n\nNote that pointers to DST values are themselves sized, so may be lvalues. As a follow-up, we may allow DST values to be passed as arguments, but that will involve some pretty gross hacks.\n\nWe already prevent DST values being stored in fields.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13376/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13376/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
