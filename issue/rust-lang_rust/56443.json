This is because building a dylib invokes the native linker, and that fails when the target architectures is too foreign and/or not supported by the installed C toolchain. (Currently, we build libstd both as rlib and dylib.)\r\n\r\nSo my goal was to equip libstd with a feature flag to control whether it is built as a dylib (next to the rlib) or not.  To this end, I patched [`collect_crate_types`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/8660eba2b9bec5b0fe971b7281f79e79c2df2fae/src/librustc_driver/driver.rs#L1500) such that the crate types passed on the command-line and the one given as attributes are merged (instead of command-line taking precedence). That means I can use `#![cfg_attr(dylib, crate-type = \"dylib\")]` to make a `dylib` feature enable a dylib build. That seems to work, however, there is a problem: During bootstrap, rustbuild uses cargo's stamp file to determine which files to copy into the sysroot, and that stamp file now no longer includes the `libstd.so`, breaking the build.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is maybe a better way to achieve an rlib-only libstd build?\r\n\r\nCc @eddyb @alexcrichton any advice?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56443/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56443/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
