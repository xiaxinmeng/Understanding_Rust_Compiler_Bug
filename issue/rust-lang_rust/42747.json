I added all the grammar symbols / tokens, and now the compilation takes more 20 minutes on my rustc 1.19.0-nightly \\(78d8416ca 2017-06-17\\), Mac OSX. The [compilation passes](https://gist.github.com/phaazon/96e674cf171204fefe75af66ec3ac0ac) point at the `item-types checking` pass \u2013 it takes roughly 5 minutes here \u2013 as being the bottleneck. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/phaazon/glsl/blob/master/src/syntax.rs).\r\n\r\nImportant note: I *think* that the problem is linked to all the numerous recursive enums. I guess rustc struggles to identify the size or whatever about the enums because it tries to see whether recursions are terminal? Thing is: I tried to box almost all variants, and the result is there: I reduced the compilation time from 20 minutes to a few seconds.\r\n\r\n> Extra note:\u00a0you can take the module linked above and compile it directly with `rustc`, no need to depend on the whole `phaazon/glsl` project ;)", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42747/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42747/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
