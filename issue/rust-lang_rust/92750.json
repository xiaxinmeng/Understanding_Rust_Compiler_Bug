It does seem consistent with the [POSIX docs](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04_13), but may not be the most intuitive behavior (particularly given that Windows doesn't do that).\r\n  * I think making the path absolute is inherently a platform-specific function.
