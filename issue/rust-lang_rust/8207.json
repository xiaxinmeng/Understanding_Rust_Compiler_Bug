If you write `task::task().name(~\"foo\").try`, you end up getting linked failure, because the default for TaskBuilder (that is, what you get from `task()`) is the same as the default spawn mode, and TaskBuilder's `try` does not set the failure linkage mode the same way the top-level `try` convenience wrapper does (indeed, for full flexibility, it can't). But this is confusing if all you want to do is name your task. I'm not sure what the best thing to do here is... maybe simply not offer a `try` for TaskBuilder.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bblum", "id": 1820515, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjA1MTU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1820515?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum", "html_url": "https://github.com/bblum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8207/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8207/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
