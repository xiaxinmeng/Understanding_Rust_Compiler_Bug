Further sleuthing determined that it was only a problem [with mutable references](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29485#issuecomment-180087795), and the performance impact was fairly small.\r\n\r\nIn #31545 we removed noalias from mutable references based on this information.\r\n\r\nIn #45012 I added a `-Zmutable-noalias` flag to opt back into the old behaviour.\r\n\r\nI am told many of the llvm bugs have been fixed (and may be completely fixed by some in-progress rewrites of the relevant components?). Also, we now have a `-Cpanic=abort` to disable unwinding altogether, which should be immune to the original problem.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with three options moving forward (not necessarily mutually exclusive):\r\n\r\n* Promote `-Zmutable-noalias` to a stable `-C` option, so stable users can opt in\r\n* Enable this internally whenever `-Cpanic=abort` is set\r\n* Enable this internally always (unclear if sound today, or when it would be)\r\n\r\nI have no particularly strong preference here; all of these options serve my purpose perfectly fine (make stable codegen better for gecko).", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45029/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45029/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
