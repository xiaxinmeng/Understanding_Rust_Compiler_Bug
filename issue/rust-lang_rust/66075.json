But I think there are some places that could still be ported to the new system:\r\n\r\n* [ ] The `InvalidValue` lint uses `match_def_path` for `transmute` -- somehow, using a diagnostic item did not work (`is_diagnostic_item` returns false).\r\n* [x] Aren't `Rc` and `Arc` lang items just for diagnostics? Here's where they get used: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f49f38871389041671cc710a044e8360091840a3/src/librustc_typeck/check/expr.rs#L879-L880\r\n    And, indirectly, at\r\n    https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f49f38871389041671cc710a044e8360091840a3/src/librustc_mir/borrow_check/error_reporting.rs#L720-L723\r\n    So, I am not sure if those should be lang items or diagnostic items now? No language semantics is attached to them, the uses above are just in error messages from what I can see. \r\n* [x] There's also no language semantics attached to `MaybeUninit`; it is a lang item because it gets used in layout construction for generators. Doesn't really fit \"diagnostics item\" either, though. (EDIT: decided this makes more sense to remain a lang item)\r\n\r\n@oli-obk @Centril any thoughts?", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66075/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66075/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
