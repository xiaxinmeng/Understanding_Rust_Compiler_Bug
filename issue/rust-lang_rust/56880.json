This however seems to be in conflict with what this RFC says:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1857-stabilize-drop-order.md#tuples-structs-and-enum-variants\r\n\r\n> Struct fields are dropped in the same order as they are declared. Consider, for instance, the struct below:\r\n\r\nAnd \r\n\r\n> Tuples and tuple structs show the same behavior, as well as enum variants of both kinds (struct and tuple variants).\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or is it intended? If so, where is it documented? If it changed, should the RFC somehow be marked as not being up to date?", "closed_by": {"login": "vorner", "id": 11783500, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjExNzgzNTAw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11783500?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vorner", "html_url": "https://github.com/vorner", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vorner/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vorner/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vorner/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vorner/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vorner/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vorner/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vorner/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vorner/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vorner/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56880/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56880/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
