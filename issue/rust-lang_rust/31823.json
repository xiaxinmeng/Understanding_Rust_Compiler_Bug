I don't know what exactly causes it so I'm attaching the project. It's not really big, 4 files, 2 are empty and the other is the lib file which just re-exports things. The code probably shouldnt work even without the compiler panic since I was just copy pasting before fixing the dependencies.\n\nRemoving `use super::*;` from the quaternion.rs file \"fixes\" it.\n\n**Edit**: replacing the line above with `use super::{Matrix4, Vector3, atan2, cross};` allows the project to compile.\n\n[math.txt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/files/141434/math.txt)\n(This is a zip file, I had to rename it because github wouldn't let me upload.
