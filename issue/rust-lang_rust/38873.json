At the moment the last line of the stack trace is always `main`. This means the stack trace is written deep->shallow, or in reverse(!) chronological order:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1:        0x10977219c - function_that_caused_the_panic\r\n2:        0x1097738ee - foo\r\n3:        0x109773590 - bar\r\n4:        0x109773cf6 - baz\r\n5:        0x109773b94 - badger\r\n6:        0x109757669 - main\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat you are generally looking for is the place that caused the panic (e.g. the line with an `assert!` or `panic!` on it), and so I think it would make sense to have that line *last* so that it is easy to find. This is particularly important when the call stack is deep and it fills your terminal. [Here is a more in-depth argument for this](http://yellerapp.com/posts/2015-01-22-upside-down-stacktraces.html). \r\n\r\nSo my suggestion is: reverse the stack trace to print the stack frames in chronological order, shallow->deep, with `main` on the top and the stack frame with the panic at the end:\r\n\r\n ```\r\n6:        0x109757669 - main\r\n5:        0x109773b94 - badger\r\n4:        0x109773cf6 - baz\r\n3:        0x109773590 - bar\r\n2:        0x1097738ee - foo\r\n1:        0x10977219c - function_that_caused_the_panic\r\n```\r\n\r\nI realize this can become quite the bikeshedding religious war, and maybe this has been discussed before \u2013 if so, I apologize. Still, until the blog post above brought it up I didn't realize that most languages \u2013 including Rust \u2013 was doing it wrong, and that there was a better way. In C++ I switched the order I print stack traces about a year ago, and since then it has saved me a lot of scrolling.\r\n\r\n*EDIT*: I've created a forum thread about this here: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/reverse-stack-trace-order/8786", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38873/reactions", "total_count": 12, "+1": 8, "-1": 1, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 3, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38873/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
