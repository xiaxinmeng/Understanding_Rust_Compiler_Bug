Instead of computing the liveness of **all variables**, for the purposes of NLL we only need to compute the liveness for variables whose types include regions. We could use the same flag mechanism described in #52027 to modify the liveness code and skip those variables whose types do not have any free regions.\r\n\r\nTo do this, we'd have to modify the liveness code. I imagine something like this:\r\n\r\n- We modify the liveness code so that it is parametric in some new index type. This index type would be `Local` if you are using all locals, but possibly something else otherwise. It would take some kind of `Local -> Option<N>` map.\r\n- In the NLL code, we would walk the locals and make a dense map of those whose types include regions (using the same flags described in #52027 to quickly test). We would also wind up with two vectors, one `IndexVec<Local, Option<RegionLocal>>` mapping to the compressed id, and one `IndexVec<RegionLocal, Local>` mapping back to the original id.\r\n- The liveness callbacks would be giving us `RegionLocal` which we would map back.\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52034/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52034/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
