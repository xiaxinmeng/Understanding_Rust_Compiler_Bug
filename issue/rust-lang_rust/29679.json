This is the exact code; I didn't even take out the commented parts.\n\nI ran `cargo build`, which gave me a snake case warning and a few unused code warnings.  I was so pleased at actually succeeding in building it that I didn't care about the warnings.\n\nI next ran `cargo run`.  Confusingly, it hung.  I ctrl-c'd the process and continued on my way.  I then tried again.  Same thing happened.  I decided to rebuild, so I changed the file by adding a blank line;  I then `cargo build`'d again, and I got back `Unknown error` and something to the effect of `use the verbose flag to find out more`.\nWhen I used the verbose flag, I got `Access is denied (OS error 5)`\nAfter a bit of searching, I discovered in the task manager that the process was still running.  Logically, I attempted to kill the process; I got back a dialog box saying `Access is denied`.\n\nI tried signing out and signing back in, to no avail. I was googling around and it seemed that the only solution was to shut down and restart my computer.  This succeeded.\nMy googling leads me to believe that I was unable to close the process because it was in kernel mode or something driver related.\nI found this: http://superuser.com/questions/585073/how-to-overcome-access-denied-when-killing-process-in-windows; it seems to be related, but it didn't fix anything.\n\nAfter I restarted, I ran the program again.  It hung again, but this time I closed the cmd prompt instead of ctrl-c'ing the process.  The process did not hang around forever this time.\n\nI'm not really sure if this is an issue with rust, and perhaps I should have just SO'ed the code and come here second, but here it is.\n\nI'm using windows 10 and Rust 1.3; anything else you need to know, just ask.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pmwhite", "id": 11892254, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjExODkyMjU0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11892254?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmwhite", "html_url": "https://github.com/pmwhite", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmwhite/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmwhite/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmwhite/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmwhite/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmwhite/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmwhite/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmwhite/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmwhite/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmwhite/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29679/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29679/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
