Sorry if it's not the place for such issue. However this has high chance to break a lot of continuous integrations and is highly linked to rust update.\r\n\r\n# Description\r\nDefault version for rustfmt in rust 1.44.0 is 1.4.14-stable (e417356 2020-04-21) when in 1.43.1 it was 1.4.12. rustfmt removed the support for `#![cfg_attr(rustfmt, rustfmt_skip)]` and `#[cfg_attr(rustfmt, rustfmt_skip)]` in version 1.4.13 (this may be a bug, I don't know). Which means lint that was passing in 1.43.1 might not in 1.44.0. \r\n\r\n# Other implications\r\nMoreover I believe `#![rustfmt:skip]` doesn't work, you need to add `#[rustfmt::skip] mod my_mod;` which is quite problematic with generated code. For example I have a lot of crate using [rust-protobuf](https://github.com/stepancheg/rust-protobuf) to generate rust structs for grpc. Before 1.44.0 all the codegen was in files `my_proto.rs` and `my_proto_grpc.rs`. \r\n\r\nSince the rust-protobuf crate was adding  `#![cfg_attr(rustfmt, rustfmt_skip)]` at the beginning of each file you would just have to include them with `mod my_proto.rs`. And now you need to change to `#[rustfmt:skip] mod my_protos.rs` which is less ergonomic because I'd like to have all the dirtyness of generated code isolated in the generated files.\r\n\r\n# Suggestions\r\nLastly I coudln't find any notes on `#[cfg_attr(rustfmt, rustfmt_skip)]` vs `#[rustfmt:skip]` in recent release notes of either rust or rustfmt. I had to scroll down to the release note of rust 1.30.0 to learn about `#[rustfmt:skip]`  and guess `#[cfg_attr(rustfmt, rustfmt_skip)]` might have been deprecated recently. I think it would be nice to mention it either in some rustfmt release note or rust 1.44.0 with an explanation on how to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nHave a excellent day !", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73078/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 1, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73078/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
