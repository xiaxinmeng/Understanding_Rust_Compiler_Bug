So a sequence as \"\\xC0\\xAE\" (an overlong encoding for \\x2E, a dot) will be accepted, and appear in the final rust-string.\nThis raises some security concerns as described in RFC3629 Section 10:\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629#section-10\n\nShort example: when a program allows a user to access files, but wants to restrict access to \"../\", it must not be possible to circumvent this check by using an overlong encoding of a dot, and the author of the program shouldn't have to rely on the OS to perform any such check either.\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    // overlong dot, should be invalid but is accepted\n    let s1 = str::from_bytes([0xc0 as u8, 0xae as u8]);\n    io::println(fmt!(\"len: %u, chars: %u, value: %s\", s1.len(), str::char_len(s1), s1));\n    // regular invalid utf, triggering an assertion fail\n    let s2 = str::from_bytes([0x80 as u8, 0xae as u8]);\n    io::println(fmt!(\"len: %u, chars: %u, value: %s\", s2.len(), str::char_len(s2), s2));\n}\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3787/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3787/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
