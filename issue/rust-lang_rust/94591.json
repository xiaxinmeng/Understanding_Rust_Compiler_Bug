If a nightly is released in the time between A and B are merged, then both will claim to have the save version, but with different features.\r\n\r\nThis almost happened with #94009 and #94150, but was prevented by manual noticing and intervension, which is not ideal.\r\n\r\nWe should figure out a way such that if 2 commits both attempt to merge the same increments, git will raise this as a merge conflict, so this situation wont occor again.\r\n\r\nA way to do this would be to store in a comment the logical \"latest feature\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEg: PR Foo\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-// Latest Feature: Initial release\r\n-const FORMAT_VERSION = 1;\r\n+// Latest Feature: Foo\r\n+const FORMAT_VERSION = 2;\r\n```\r\n\r\nPR Bar:\r\n```diff\r\n-// Latest Feature: Initial release\r\n-const FORMAT_VERSION = 1;\r\n+// Latest Feature: Bar\r\n+const FORMAT_VERSION = 2;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Foo is merged, when Bar is attempted to be merged, the following conflict will occor\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n<<<<<<< HEAD\r\n// Latest Feature: Foo\r\n=======\r\n// Latest Feature: Bar\r\n>>>>>>> bar\r\nconst FORMAT_VERSION = 2;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could work, but will have a problem if two features are given the same name, and then we're back to where we were. If someone knows some git-trickery to get around that, that would be great, but if not, I still thing doing this (or something to this effect) would be worthwhile.\r\n\r\ncc @Dylan-DPC @CraftSpider \r\n\r\n@rustbot modify labels: +T-rustdoc +A-rustdoc-json\r\n ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94591/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 1, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94591/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
