This is less than optimal, and while in most cases the performance difference probably won't be noticeably, it's still a low-hanging fruit.\n\nWhat would be nice to have is some kind of syntax extension to define UTF-16 string literals, for example:\n\n```\nlet foo: &'static [u16] = utf16!(\"example\");\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Fanael", "id": 270470, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDQ3MA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/270470?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fanael", "html_url": "https://github.com/Fanael", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fanael/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fanael/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fanael/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fanael/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fanael/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fanael/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fanael/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fanael/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fanael/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13918/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13918/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
