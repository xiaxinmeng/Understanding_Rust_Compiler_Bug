Pardon me if this is a duplicate or in the wrong repository.\n\nI wrote an [in depth guide about Rust code coverage](http://sunjay.ca/2016/07/25/rust-code-coverage) a few months ago based on the older guide that had been around for a while. One of the things I wrote about was that you can't currently get code coverage for documentation tests because `cargo test` or `cargo test --doc` doesn't output any test executable for documentation tests. The tool being used to generate coverage data, kcov, requires an executable that directly runs the code you want to measure.\n\nIt would be really helpful if there was a way not to just temporarily generate an executable for documentation tests, but also to have the option to store that executable somewhere (much like how the unit test executable is generated and stored in `target/debug`). That way we can manually run it using whatever tools we please.\n\nI'm really surprised that I couldn't find an existing issue for this. There is a [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/a/35669152/551904) about the issue but it doesn't lead anywhere. Hopefully this is a duplicate and it's been on your radar for some time.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37048/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37048/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
