In particular, one cannot make a submodule in a file like `foo/bar.rs`.\r\n- Directory modules: a `foo/mod.rs` file is a directory module. One can create submodules in files like `foo/bar.rs`.\r\n\r\nAs part of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44660, we plan to support either of those two forms. However, the two forms should not be usable for a single module simultaneously: in other words, you can have `foo.rs` **or** `foo/mod.rs`, but not both. (One is permitted to intermingle the two forms within a single project, however.)\r\n\r\nBecause the RFC has a number of moving parts, we wanted to feature-gate semi-independent features with distinct names. Therefore, `foo.rs` files that contain submodules can be gated under the feature name `module_flexible_submodules`.\r\n\r\n(Note: Please limit discussion on this issue strictly to implementation concerns relative to this particular change. Policy discussion as to whether or not to make this change -- or whether to make other changes to the module system -- belong in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44660.)", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45385/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45385/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
