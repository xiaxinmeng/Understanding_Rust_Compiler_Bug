Instead, I would like the sidebar to have three sub-sections (Servo, submodules, and Rust) each listing the corresponding crates. The sidebar is generated by a copy of [`src/librustdoc/html/static/main.js`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/8a02304a44/src/librustdoc/html/static/main.js#L682-L698), and therefore is not easy to customize.\n\nCould rustdoc help with this? Perhaps, rather than adding a feature for exactly what Servo wants, enable arbitrary behavior by providing a hook for overriding the bit of JS that generates the sidebar?\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16328/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16328/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
