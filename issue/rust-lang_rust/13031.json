No problem with it as the language evolves.\n\nBut the following constructs proposed for the new `vec_ng::Vec design` (below) `v.get(1)` and especially `*v.get_mut(1)`  instead of used to be `[]` are bulky and over-complicated in my opinion:\n\n``` rust\nuse std::io::println;\nuse std::vec::Vec;\n\nfn main()\n{\n    let mut v = vec!(1, 2, 3);\n    //let elem = v[1];\n    let elem = v.get(1);\n    //v[1] = 4;\n    *v.get_mut(1) = 4;\n}\n```\n\nCould you please add more usual `[]` index access to `std::vec_ng::Vec` design?\nThanks!\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13031/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13031/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
