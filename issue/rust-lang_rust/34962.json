We should get rid of [this](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/75886537858530447051b9c1ef595c4ba59017c5/src/librustc_llvm/lib.rs#L2369) monstrosity and use the functions instead.\n\nThe problem is that these functions are currently `static inline` and thus have no symbol of their own. In order to be able to use them in rustc, we need to create a binding for it.\n\nFor now the migration would look something like this:\n- [ ] Implement `RustLLVMInitializeAll{Targets,TargetInfos,TargetMCs,AsmPrinters,AsmParsers}` in rust_llvm. These would call the `static inline` counterparts directly.\n- [ ] `initialize_available_targets` gets changed to call newly created wrappers;\n- [ ] Make sure our distribution LLVM is only compiled with the targets that we want to support (x86, ARM, Aarch64, MIPS, PNaCl); \n\ncc @rust-lang/compiler \n\nI also would consider this as an `E-easy` issue. The general direction for fixing this issue are listed above and this issue would help to understand how LLVM initialisation works and how rustc ties into the LLVM.\n\n---\n\nOnce something like [this patch](https://reviews.llvm.org/D22736) lands and gets into all LLVM versions we support we could then remove the wrapper altogether.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nagisa", "id": 679122, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTEyMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/679122?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa", "html_url": "https://github.com/nagisa", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nagisa/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34962/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34962/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
