This is highly unfortunate.\r\n\r\nThe problem is the `rust-gdb` wrapper script and the design of the python pretty printers; one can't simply do \r\n```\r\n> gdb fooapp\r\n> gdb> source PATH/TO/gdb_load_rust_pretty_printers.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis basically means that, for instance a GUI needs to know what language is being debugged _before actually starting debugging_.\r\n\r\nInstead, for a GUI, once the debuggee has been loaded it can query the language (via the DWARF debug info) and then take action on what to do. But this requires that `gdb_load_rust_pretty_printers.py` is \"source'able\" from GDB, after GDB has been spawned - which it currently is not.
