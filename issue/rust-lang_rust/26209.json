Because we have a reference, we need to give it a lifetime. But our factory() function takes no arguments, so elision doesn\u2019t kick in here. What lifetime can we choose? 'static:\n\nfn factory() -> &'static (Fn(i32) -> i32) {\n    let num = 5;\n\n    |x| x + num\n}\n\nlet f = factory();\n\nlet answer = f(1);\nassert_eq!(6, answer);\n```\n\nThis caused a bit of confusion, specially when trying to use the given solution to returning closures with `Vec<i32>` since using the solution throws an error with that type:\n\n``` rust\nfn factory() -> Box<Fn(i32) -> Vec<i32>> {\n    let vec = vec![1, 2, 3];\n\n    Box::new(move |n| vec.push(n))\n}\n```\n\n``` shell\nsrc/main.rs:44:23: 44:34 error: mismatched types:\n expected `collections::vec::Vec<i32>`,\n    found `()`\n(expected struct `collections::vec::Vec`,\n    found ()) [E0308]\nsrc/main.rs:44     Box::new(move |n| vec.push(n))\n                                     ^~~~~~~~~~~\nerror: aborting due to previous error\nCould not compile `learning_rust`.\n\nTo learn more, run the command again with --verbose.\n```\n\nAm I missing something here or should the documentation use `i32` from the beginning of the section? If there's anything I can do to help with this I'd be glad to make a PR. \n", "closed_by": {"login": "Tonkpils", "id": 1507561, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDc1NjE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1507561?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tonkpils", "html_url": "https://github.com/Tonkpils", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tonkpils/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tonkpils/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tonkpils/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tonkpils/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tonkpils/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tonkpils/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tonkpils/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tonkpils/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tonkpils/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": true}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/26209/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/26209/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
