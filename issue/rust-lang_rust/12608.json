This makes sure that by default you don't pass rust types into C functions. What we don't have is a lint going the other way which makes sure that C can't get Rust types from Rust. I believe that we need to expand the FFI lint to crawl `extern` functions as well as `extern` blocks. \n\nThe exact types which should be allowed is a little questionable. Some things that would be _nice_ to have a defined ABI/FFI for would, but may currently not be working:\n- `Option<&T>` and `Option<~T>`. See #11303, but this is currently broken. Do we want to commit to this ABI and say that it's valid to use to interface with C?\n- `~T` and `&T`, are these valid FFI types? The rust type system guarantees they are never null, but there's no guarantee that C handed you something that's not null.\n- `&str` - should this be valid to pass in/out? This would require something along the lines of `rust.h`\n\nTo be conservative, we could _only_ allow primitives (minus `int` and `uint`) plus `*T`, but this is quite limiting and makes FFI a little more difficult.\n\nNominating.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12608/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12608/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
