However, the `Display` impl on `io::Error` formats the `Repr::Os` (i.e. errno-like) variant using `write!(fmt, \"{} (os error {})\", detail, code)` which produces the text \"Operation not permitted (os error 1)\". The integer value of errno is an implementation detail which just adds visual clutter.\r\n\r\n(Right now, I just add `#allow(deprecated)` to the call to `description()`, but this is a code smell that I'd like to get rid of.)\r\n\r\nTo fix this, simply remove the error number from the `Display` impl since [\"`Display` is for user-facing output\"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/fmt/trait.Display.html) and this kind of noise does not belong there. It is still in the `Debug` output for anybody who wants it. Alternatively, if the `Display` format is frozen (why?) then another method which gets at just the error text would be helpful. `ErrorKind::as_str()` could be made public, for example.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79230/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79230/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
