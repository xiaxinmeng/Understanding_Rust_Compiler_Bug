Is it really necessary to borrow closure so early? Can't we give the borrow a scope that starts after the arguments have been evaluated?\n\nUsing: rustc 1.2.0-nightly (d6c8028ce 2015-06-09)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bluss", "id": 3209739, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDk3Mzk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3209739?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss", "html_url": "https://github.com/bluss", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/26193/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/26193/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
