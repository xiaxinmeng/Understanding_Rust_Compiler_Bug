But I thought I would report it anyway.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to the front page of the std results from rustdoc\r\n2. Click in the search box at the top of the page\r\n3. Type in `assert` (as an example search term) and hit Return\r\n4. If your rustdoc version has the bug #79960, and you have cookies disabled or are viewing the docs via a `file://` url, click anywhere outside the help popup to dismiss it\r\n5. See that some search results are displayed.\r\n6. Move the mouse pointer over the search results.  A moving highlight is displayed.\r\n7. Move the mouse pointer over the search box, and left click, to focus the search box\r\n8. Hit return to search for the same thing again\r\n\r\n### Expected results\r\n\r\nThe same search is performed again, so the page reloads with little change.\r\n\r\n### Actual results\r\n\r\nWhatever search result you last moused over, which has the highlight shown, is visited.\r\n\r\n@rustdoc modify labels +T-rustdoc -A-rustdoc-ui", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79962/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79962/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
