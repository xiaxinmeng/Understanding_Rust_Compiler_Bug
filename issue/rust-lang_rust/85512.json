MCP](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/434)\r\n* [x] Add a `--force-warn XXX` option that is given either a lint or lint group `XXX`\r\n* [x] When this command line option is used, all other lint settings the lints covered by `XXX` will always issue warnings, regardless of whether they are \"allowed\" by the code or command-line options\r\n\r\nCargo fix changes:\r\n\r\n* [x] This command line option is supplied by `cargo fix --edition` in order to force migration lints etc to be considered\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n\r\nWe would like to take some existing warnings and make them into errors in the new edition. We anticipate this being a common pattern. The problem is that these warnings, if they already exist, may be marked a `#[allow]` in various code bases. As a result, `cargo fix` would not see the migration suggestions and migration would not succeed.\r\n\r\n## Proposed plan\r\n\r\nTo become part of a migration, existing lints can be directly added into `rust-2021-migration` group.\r\n\r\n## Caveat: Multiple groups\r\n\r\nThis plan means that some lints are members of multiple groups. This has been discouraged but in the past but [we currently believe](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/268952-edition-2021/topic/force.20warn/near/236214729) that it should work fine. We should test the scenario where a lint is in two groups and one of those groups is allow.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n\r\nWe could instead introduce a fresh copy of these lints that is a member of `rust_2021_migrations`. For example, if there is a lint `foo`, maybe we make a `foo_2021` lint that is *specifically* for the migration. We could perhaps make this convenient to issue in the code by having some option when creating the lint that is like `.migration(RUST_2021_MIGRATioN)`. This could also make the lint into a hard error automatically in the new edition, regardless of the lint level.\r\n\r\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\r\n\r\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\r\n\r\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"rylev\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\r\n\r\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\r\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": {"login": "m-ou-se", "id": 783247, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc4MzI0Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/783247?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se", "html_url": "https://github.com/m-ou-se", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85512/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85512/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
