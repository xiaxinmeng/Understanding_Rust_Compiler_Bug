D'oh. So here goes the summarized version:\r\n\r\n- For the time being, you probably want to be doing your incremental builds with nightly, because it will have the most up to date support. Therefore, we will add a `--incremental` option to configure. It will imply `--enable-local-rust` and `--enable-local-build` -- meaning that instead of beta, we'll bootstrap with the local nightly. You have to manage this yourself with rustup. Stay up to date.\r\n- `--incremental` will also imply a default target of stage1.\r\n- When building the stage1 compiler, we'll supply an incremental directory.\r\n- Furthermore, instead of building the stage2 libs with the stage1 compiler, by default we will copy them. This only works if nobody has changed the metadata format between your nightly and stage1, so we probably want a way to disable this, but it should be a big speedup most of the time.\r\n\r\ncc @alexcrichton @michaelwoerister, sound right?", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37929/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37929/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
