It depends on T whether that already makes for proper initialization. For example, MaybeUninit<usize>::zeroed() is initialized, but MaybeUninit<&'static i32>::zeroed() is not because references must not be null.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nWhile perhaps implied by the terminology of \"memory being filled with 0 bytes\", it would be great to explicitly state whether or not padding bytes are included.\r\n\r\nFor me it's a bit ambiguous because both `std::mem::zeroed` and `std::mem::MaybeUninit` are parametrized by `T`. Hence, neither really exposes a concept of \"raw\" bytes to the user, but just the Rust type. Yet if I compare the above documentation to [`std::mem::zeroed`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.zeroed.html) it states, among other things:\r\n\r\n> This means that, for example, the padding byte in (u8, u16) is not necessarily zeroed.\r\n\r\nSo there padding bytes are explicitly excluded.\r\n\r\nIt's particularly confusing, because `std::mem::zeroed` states:\r\n\r\n> This has the same effect as [MaybeUninit::zeroed().assume_init()](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/union.MaybeUninit.html#method.zeroed). It is useful for FFI sometimes, but should generally be avoided.\r\n\r\nShould we make it more explicit that `std::mem::MaybeUninit::zeroed` also zeroes out padding bytes?
