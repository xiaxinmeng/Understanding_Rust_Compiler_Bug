This is a large issue for be because i'm interacting with a kernel interfaces that requires the unwind_table entry for a specific function. Here is the issue in detail: https://github.com/rust-lang/backtrace-rs/issues/397#issuecomment-846422025\r\n\r\nI'd expect that even though i've set the panic=abort mode that unwind tables are generated, and especially with the force-unwind-tables flag set to yes. I only need a specific function to have an unwind entry, so perhaps a #[unwind_entry] function attribute could make sense to introduce? The panic behavior should be separate from what binary tables are generated, they are separate concerns...\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85582/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85582/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
