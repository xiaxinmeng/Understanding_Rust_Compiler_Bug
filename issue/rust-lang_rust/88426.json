For help text, I've tried to ensure that every unstable flag says whether or not it is unstable in the help. In the past, we've hidden those options but found that was bad for discovery. I've also reworked Cargo's unstable messages to be different based on the channel. For example:\r\n>\r\n> ```\r\n> error: the `--unit-graph` flag is unstable, and only available on the nightly channel of Cargo, but this is the `beta` channel\r\n> See https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html for more information about Rust release channels.\r\n> See https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8002 for more information about the `--unit-graph` flag.\r\n> ```\r\n> vs on nightly:\r\n> ```\r\n> error: the `--unit-graph` flag is unstable, pass `-Z unstable-options` to enable it\r\n> See https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8002 for more information about the `--unit-graph` flag.\r\n> ```\r\n> It is a bit hard to squeeze a complete explanation in an error message of what \"nightly\" is and how to install and use nightly. It's definitely not perfect, but hopefully an improvement from the old messages. It might be nice for rustc and rustdoc to consider something similar.\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88426/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88426/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
