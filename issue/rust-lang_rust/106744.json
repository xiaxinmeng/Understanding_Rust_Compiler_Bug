I'm working on [a library](https://github.com/framesurge/perseus) that uses two custom `RUSTFLAGS` to control what it provides for different environments, and those two flags are mutually exclusive. However, I wanted to make sure items from both were available in the documentation produced by `cargo doc`, so I followed [these instructions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/advanced-features.html#cfgdoc-documenting-platform-specific-or-feature-specific-information) and used `#[cfg(doc)]` for this. That works excellently, except the dependencies of the crate are also controlled by these custom flags (e.g. `[target.'cfg(engine)'.dependencies]`), so I expected to be able to write something like this:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[target.'cfg(any(client, doc))'.dependencies]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't seem to work at all, because I still get all the usual unresolved import errors. Changing this to use another custom flag `clientdoc`, rather than the internal `doc`, and then running\r\n\r\n```\r\nRUSTFLAGS=\"--cfg=engine --cfg=clientdoc\" cargo doc\r\n```\r\n\r\nworks perfectly. (Although one of these custom flags is involved with importing traditionally Wasm-specific crates, I am almost certain that this is not the problem.)\r\n\r\nI expected that `#[cfg(doc)]` would, like any custom `RUSTFLAGS` I provide, be applied to `Cargo.toml` as well as the actual code.\r\n\r\nInstead, this does not seem to occur, and another custom flag has to be used, which isn't ideal.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n<!--\r\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\r\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.68.0-nightly (92c1937a9 2022-12-27)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 92c1937a90e5b6f20fa6e87016d6869da363972e\r\ncommit-date: 2022-12-27\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.68.0-nightly\r\nLLVM version: 15.0.6\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a backtrace in the code block by setting `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` in your\r\nenvironment.
