It would be easier to read if they were in a single block.\r\n\r\n[web-sys]: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/tree/master/crates/web-sys", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52563/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 5, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52563/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
