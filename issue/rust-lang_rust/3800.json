However there is one negative side effect that comes with it: accidental mapping to nil:\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let y = [1, 2, 3, 4].map(|x| {\n        *x * 2;\n    });\n    for y.each |x| {\n        io::println(fmt!(\"%?\", *x));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn certain cases it never makes sense to produce nil as a result.  For instance the map function is such a case.  Why would you ever want to map to nil?  You might want to map to Option<T> but that's a different story.  What about a NonNil trait that could be used for such cases so that this would be caught at compile time.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "catamorphism", "id": 427212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzIxMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/427212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism", "html_url": "https://github.com/catamorphism", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3800/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3800/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
