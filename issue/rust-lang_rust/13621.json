Guys on IRC helped answer my questions so I ~~think~~ hope what I changed is pretty accurate.\n\nI'll probably try to do more but I wanted to put this up so people could see.  I think it's much better.  They're all in this commit.\n\nhttps://github.com/mdinger/rust/commit/b5809644ad6ee87dc28afd8200fa8e12213f4f29\n\nLet me be clear, from reading the tutorial earlier, it wasn't obvious `b: |int|` had anything to do with a function.  I thought it meant an `int` was gonna be assigned to `b`.  All the vertical bars did was make it special.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13621/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13621/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
