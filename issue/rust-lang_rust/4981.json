This is very unfortunate since these subdirectory declarations are often one of the first bits of code in a crate.\n\nThis variation is hard to read because the alternation of syntaxes between lines\n\n```\n#[path = \"foo/foo.rs\"]\nmod foo;\n#[path = \"barkeeper/barkeeper.rs\"]\nmod barkeepr;\n#[path = \"baz/baz.rs\"]\nmod baz;\n```\n\nAnd this one because the `mod`s don't line up:\n\n```\n#[path = \"foo/foo.rs\"] mod foo;\n#[path = \"barkeeper/barkeeper.rs\"] mod barkeeper;\n#[path = \"baz/baz.rs\"] mod baz;\n```\n\nThis one reads a bit better but isn't possible:\n\n```\nmod foo #[path = \"foo/foo.rs\"];\nmod barkeeper #[path = \"barkeeper/barkeeper.rs\"];\nmod baz #[path = \"baz/baz.rs\"];\n```\n\nOf course this may just indicate that the way we are dealing with subdirectories is bad.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "graydon", "id": 14097, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDk3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14097?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon", "html_url": "https://github.com/graydon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4981/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4981/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
