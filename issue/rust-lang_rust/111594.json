This makes the minimum size of a `staticlib` something around 20MB with Rust 1.69 on Linux x86-64, which is not exactly small.\r\n\r\nThis is currently a [blocker for GStreamer](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/cerbero/-/issues/381#ios-and-android-blockers-for-enabling-rust-variant-by-default) to ship (static) plugins written in Rust on Android/iOS (and elsewhere) as that adds up to a couple of 100MB.\r\n\r\nWhile this can in theory be solved after the fact by repackaging the `ar` archives and having a single copy of std, this seems like something that could be useful to solve in general.\r\n\r\nAn obvious solution here would be having some kind of \"slim\" `staticlib` variant which does not include a copy of everything every time but instead require the final linking step (to an executable or shared library) to list a static `libstd.a` (among other things). This would also require to ship a static version of std together with the already existing shared version. `--print native-static-libs` would then print all those other static libraries too.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/111594/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/111594/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
