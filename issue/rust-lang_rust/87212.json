This likely only trips up newcomers to rust, but I know a fair number of python users who had this as their first error message. There are likely some some other collections this could apply to, but `Vec` would definitely constitute most of these mistakes.\r\n\r\nIf nobody is immediately opposed to this change, I would like to try to implement this. I would need some help with _where_ to make this change, but this seems like a fair introduction into editing compiler output.\r\n\r\nIt may also be helpful to just add a section mentioning `push` to the `append` function docs.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87212/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87212/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
