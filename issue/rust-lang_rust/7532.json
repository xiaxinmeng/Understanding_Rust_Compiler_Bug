These are necessary to be able to be able to easily spot perfomance regressions, as well as have a good quantitative data about Rust's performance.\n\nBenchmarks should cover both space and time characteristics, and should use the built-in bench runner where possible. Some ideas:\n- Allocating an object with a destructor\n- Allocating a @-ptr\n- Destructuring an enum/struct/tuple/tuple struct/vector\n- Pattern matching\n- Numeric manipulation (should be covered fairly well by the current shootout stuff, but should be extracted)\n- Data structure manipulation (vec benchmarks etc, similar to what `core-map` and friends do)\n- String manipulation\n- Method call\n- Trait object method call\n- Task communication (like `pingpong` does) with the various primitives (one-shots, streams, protocols)\n- Logging\n\nAn important note: these benchmarks aren't intended for comparison to other languages (although they could be useful for that in the future), but for _tracking the performance of Rust_.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7532/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7532/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
