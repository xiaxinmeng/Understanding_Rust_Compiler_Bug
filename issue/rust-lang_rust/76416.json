Make sure to include the relevant\r\nRFC for the feature if it has one. Otherwise provide a short summary of the\r\nfeature and link any relevant PRs or issues, and remove any sections that are\r\nnot relevant to the feature.\r\n\r\nRemember to add team labels to the tracking issue.\r\nFor a language team feature, this would e.g., be `T-lang`.\r\nSuch a feature should also be labeled with e.g., `F-my_feature`.\r\nThis label is used to associate issues (e.g., bugs and design questions) to the feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for `Duration` saturating operations.\r\nThe feature gate for the issue is `#![feature(duration_saturating_ops)]`.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n        impl Duration {\r\n            pub const fn saturating_add(self, rhs: Duration) -> Duration {}\r\n            pub const fn saturating_sub(self, rhs: Duration) -> Duration {}\r\n            pub const fn saturating_mul(self, rhs: u32) -> Duration {}\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n<!--\r\nInclude each step required to complete the feature. Typically this is a PR\r\nimplementing a feature, followed by a PR that stabilises the feature. However\r\nfor larger features an implementation could be broken up into multiple PRs.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implement the proposal: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76114\r\n- [x] FCP\r\n- [x] Stabilization PR: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84090\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* ~~Do we want associated constants similar to the ones that already exist for integer types or associated methods? (ie: `Duration::MIN` or `Duration::min()`?~~\r\n* ~~Should `Duration::MIN` be replaced by `Duration::zero()`? They are currently equivalent but one can image a future where `Duration` is able to hold negative duration and thus making `MIN` different from `zero()`.~~\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76416/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 6, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76416/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
