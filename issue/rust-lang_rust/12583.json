It's actually implemented using `stat()`, which means that it will test the pointed-to file for a link.\n\nFurthermore, `.is_file()` doesn't even document whether it tries to look through links.\n\nI expect both of these files _should_ be using `stat()`, so their implementations are correct, but the documentation needs to be updated to explicitly state that it will test the pointed-to file for a link.\n\nWhile we're at it, `.exists()` says it \"will return true if the path points to either a directory or a file\". This can be expected to be read as \"regular file\", but it returns `true` for all file kinds, not just directories and regular files. Specifically, it just tests if `stat()` returns `true`. Incidentally, this means it will in fact return `false` if the path represents a symlink that does exist but points to a path that doesn't. This should also be documented.\n\nAlso, as long as we're exposing a `.stat()` convenience here, we should probably expose an `.lstat()` convenience method as well.\n\nAnd finally, these methods all reference conditions (specifically, saying they don't raise conditions). That bit needs to be deleted outright.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12583/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12583/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
