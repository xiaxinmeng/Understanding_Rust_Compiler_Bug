Here is some code to clarify:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// crate a\r\npub struct S {\r\n    pub crate_a: ()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// crate b\r\nextern crate a;\r\n\r\nmod private {\r\n    pub struct S {\r\n        pub crate_b: ()\r\n    }\r\n    pub use a::S as X;\r\n}\r\n    \r\npub mod public {\r\n    pub use private::*;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// crate c\r\nextern crate b;\r\n\r\npub use b::public;\r\n```\r\nThe documentation for `c::public::S` shows the documentation for `a::S` but the actual type is `b::private::S`. There is no page for `c::public::X`.\r\n\r\nThis shows up in the wild in the documentation for [`iron::headers::Cookie`](http://ironframework.io/doc/iron/headers/struct.Cookie.html), which is [`hyper::header::Cookie`](http://ironframework.io/doc/hyper/header/struct.Cookie.html) but shows [`cookie::Cookie`](http://ironframework.io/doc/cookie/struct.Cookie.html).\r\n\r\nI don't think this is one of the issues already documented in  #24305", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37608/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37608/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
