I use a very simple example below that reproduces the issue.\r\n\r\nI have two files that contains tests, `tests/test_one.rs` and `tests/test_two.rs`. Both contains exactly the same content (except for the unique test function name they contain):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nmod routines;\r\n\r\n#[test]\r\nfn test_one() {\r\n    routines::my_routine();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd another file called `tests/routines.rs` that simply contains:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn my_routine() {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I execute `cargo test`, the two tests are executed successfully and there is no raised warning. But if I remove the `my_routine()` call from one of the two tests, `cargo test` stills end up successfully but raises a warning on `pub fn routine()` saying `function is never used`. However, one test still calls the function, so there is no dead code as stated. \r\n\r\nI got the same issue with both rust stable (1.22.1) and rust nightly (1.24.0).\r\n\r\nThanks.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46379/reactions", "total_count": 43, "+1": 43, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46379/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
