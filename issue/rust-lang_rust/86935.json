Make sure to include the relevant\r\nRFC for the feature if it has one. Otherwise provide a short summary of the\r\nfeature and link any relevant PRs or issues, and remove any sections that are\r\nnot relevant to the feature.\r\n\r\nRemember to add team labels to the tracking issue.\r\nFor a language team feature, this would e.g., be `T-lang`.\r\nSuch a feature should also be labeled with e.g., `F-my_feature`.\r\nThis label is used to associate issues (e.g., bugs and design questions) to the feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for the \"more qualified paths\" feature. This feature originally grew out of a bug report https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79658 where structs with qualified paths could not be constructed or used in patterns. \r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let <Foo as MyTrait>::Assoc { a} = <Foo as MyTrait>::Assoc { a: 2 };\r\n    // The above would previously not parse.\r\n    assert!(a == 2);\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct StructStruct {\r\n    a: i8,\r\n}\r\n\r\ntrait MyTrait {\r\n    type Assoc;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct Foo;\r\n\r\nimpl MyTrait for Foo {\r\n    type Assoc = StructStruct;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the implementation PR [#80080](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80080) for more detailed discussion. \r\n\r\nThe feature gate for the issue is `#![feature(more_qualified_paths)]`.\r\n\r\n### About tracking issues\r\n\r\nTracking issues are used to record the overall progress of implementation.\r\nThey are also used as hubs connecting to other relevant issues, e.g., bugs or open design questions.\r\nA tracking issue is however *not* meant for large scale discussion, questions, or bug reports about a feature.\r\nInstead, open a dedicated issue for the specific matter and add the relevant feature gate label.\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n<!--\r\nInclude each step required to complete the feature. Typically this is a PR\r\nimplementing a feature, followed by a PR that stabilises the feature. However\r\nfor larger features an implementation could be broken up into multiple PRs.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implement the feature https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80080\r\n- [ ] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][doc-guide])\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][stabilization-guide])\r\n\r\n[stabilization-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr\r\n[doc-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#documentation-prs\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n### Implementation history\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80080\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86935/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86935/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
