The temporary `std::cell::Ref` created in the `match` scrutinee has its lifetime needlessly extended to cover the `match` body.\r\n\r\nThe Rust reference has the following to say about `match` (emphasis mine):\r\n> If the scrutinee expression is a value expression, _it is first evaluated into a temporary location_, and the resulting value is sequentially compared to the patterns in the arms until a match is found.\r\n\r\nBased on this statement, it seems like it was intended for the two functions to be equivalent. Hence, I believe the current behavior is a flaw in the compiler.
