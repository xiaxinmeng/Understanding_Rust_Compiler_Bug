If you do a successful `rustpkg install` (one which actually installs--not one that exhibits the problem above) and then remove the binary from bin, a subsequent `rustpkg install` or `rustpkg build` will fail with something like this:\n   \n   task <unnamed> failed at 'Unhandled condition: bad_stat: (std::path::PosixPath{is_absolute: true, components: ~[~\"home\", ~\"micah\", ~\"progs\", ~\"rustpkg-wc-bug\", ~\"bin\", ~\"myapp\"]}, ~\"Couldn't get file access time\")'\n\nRemoving `.rust/rustpkg_db.json` from the workspace fixes both problems (temporarily, until the next rustpkg build or install puts it back.)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "catamorphism", "id": 427212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzIxMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/427212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism", "html_url": "https://github.com/catamorphism", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9112/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9112/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
