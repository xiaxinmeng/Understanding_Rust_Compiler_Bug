So it is not possible to compile libnative without libstd. I am not sure how rust is able to compile libstd, but I think it requires an existing libstd to compile with. \n\nMy suggestion is to factor out more parts of libstd into their own crates with non-cyclic dependencies. \n- `from_str`: belongs to collections, because this is where string is defined?\n- `path`: this can be made it's own crate libpath, if we also extract some of the common macros (see below) into their own crate.\n- `os`: this can be made it's own crate, if we somehow factor out `io::{IoResult, IoError}` from libstd.\n- `libio` ?\n\nAfter that, for example `libnative` would no longer depend on `libstd`. I haven't looked at other libraries, but I think it's possible too to de-cycle them.\n\nWhat else would need to be done?\n- `deriving(Clone)` right now generates code with `::std::clone::Clone` while it should be `::core::clone::Clone`. I think this is useful in general also for other projects that solely depend on libcore. Other derivings might have to be changed to ::core as well.\n- `format_args!`: same here.\n- `libstd/macros.rs`: fail!, assert!, assert_eq!, debug_assert!, debug_assert_eq!, unreachable!, unimplemented!, format!, try!, vec!. They shouldn't live in libstd as they might be useful in other software that depend on libcore (plus fail functionality).\n\nIf this is something we want, I can come up with some patches. Clearly more discussion is needed IMHO.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mneumann", "id": 34112, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTEy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34112?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mneumann", "html_url": "https://github.com/mneumann", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mneumann/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mneumann/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mneumann/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mneumann/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mneumann/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mneumann/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mneumann/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mneumann/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mneumann/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15974/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15974/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
