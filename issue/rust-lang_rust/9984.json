Speed is important but the crucial point is reliably meeting deadlines. Garbage collectors, JIT compilers, and run-time optimizers are bad for predictability, so Java's RTSJ has inherent problems in addition to its complexity.)\n\nMany real-time programs are also safety-critical, which entails more or less the same language needs as security-critical programming: fewer failure modes, easy to understand and reason about, less error-prone, easy to learn, easy to document.\n\nRust is a great base for this. AIUI, the remaining pieces are:\n- [ ] A run-time library (or a special profile of the standard library) that can fork real-time tasks as native threads (that don't cooperatively share threads via N:M concurrency) and that explicitly omits GC managed memory facilities. This will require expertise in low-level Rust core libraries.\n- [ ] Instructions on using this library, including using `#[deny(managed_heap_memory)]` and `#[no_std]` et al to ensure the code can't directly or indirectly use GC managed memory.\n- [x] Meanwhile, don't rule-out real-time programs, e.g. don't let a garbage collector pause a ~~thread~~ Rust task that doesn't use GC managed memory.\n\nIdeally, code outside the real-time tasks would be able to use GC managed memory, say in parsing command-line arguments, but that's not required.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9984/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9984/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
