I know that a stability attribute can be inherited from the *parent* item, but the nearest use of `panic_internals` is in the feature gate of the `internal_constructor` method which is a *sibling* item in the same `impl` block. The parent (the `impl` block) does not have any stability attribute. The grand-parent (the module) is unstable with the feature gate `core_panic_info`.\r\n\r\nDo we have docs for the precise rules for \"inherited\" stability? Should we change those rules to make a stability attribute mandatory in cases like this?\r\n\r\n@alexcrichton, do you know who would know about this?
