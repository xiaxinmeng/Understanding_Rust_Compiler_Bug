Unfortunately it was hard to quantify this regression since we also changed a lot during this time. \n\nFortunately I just found a good example that shows a 20-fold increase in compile time. It is a [single file](https://gist.github.com/nwin/b0b8bb23040a526b5b59) with no other dependencies (if somebody wants to try: the [original version](https://github.com/cmr/TEMP-rust-png) is even much older). The two revisions are exactly the same code, the newer just has been updated to compile on a recent rustc. Note that this is `rustc` only, no time is spend in llvm.\n\n```\n$ sudo rustc --version\nrustc 0.13.0-nightly (7608dbad6 2014-12-31 10:06:21 -0800)\n$ time sudo rustc --crate-type=lib -Z no-trans inflate.rs\n\nreal    0m1.176s\nuser    0m1.059s\nsys 0m0.113s\n```\n\n(note that something is wrong with the old .pkg-file I used to install rustc, I need to use sudo to run it)\n\n```\n$ rustc --version\nrustc 1.1.0-nightly (c4b23aec4 2015-04-29) (built 2015-04-28)\n$ time rustc --crate-type=lib -Z no-trans inflate.rs\n\nreal    0m25.208s\nuser    0m23.919s\nsys 0m1.213s\n```\n\nThe [time profiles](https://gist.github.com/nwin/016c7e64ae270f519cdb) show that `driver::phase_1_parse_input` and `driver::phase_2_configure_and_expand` almost stayed constant while the time spent in `driver::phase_3_run_analysis_passes` exploded.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pnkfelix", "id": 173127, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173127?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix", "html_url": "https://github.com/pnkfelix", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25069/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25069/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
