It still calls `format!()`. This is surprising from a user point of view - you're calling a function, but it seems like it has no side effects and I don't use the result, so surely it should be removed?\r\n\r\nI presume the reason it doesn't is that it allocates a `String` and heap allocation is considered to be a side effect? Whatever the reason I think that it would be nice if it was optimised.\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering about motivation, consider a debug trait with a default implementation that does nothing. You could call `debug.write(&format!(...))` and it would be fully optimised away for the default implementation.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75742/reactions", "total_count": 8, "+1": 8, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75742/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
