But what if I add a new variant `D` to `A`? Perhaps I really should add a case to the `alt` for `D` (since `foo` could now be in variant `D`), but the compiler gives me zero help in this case.\n\nI propose an attribute called `no_omit` (actually, I don't really care what it's called) to be used like:\n\n`enum A { B, C, #[no_omit] D}`\n\nwhich has the effect of generating a warning if any `alt check` expressions omit the case for `D`. (I'm not too opinionated about whether it should be a lint warning or an error, so long as there's _some_ way to enable it.) I expect the attribute would be used temporarily, during development, and then removed once the refactor that introduces `D` is completed.   \n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2388/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2388/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
