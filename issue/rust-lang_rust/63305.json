I haven't observed this myself because I prefer nightly compilers and assume it works on stable if there's no feature flags, and docs.rs uses a nightly compiler as well so published docs work fine. It should be relatively easy to produce this warning on stable as most of the same logic already exists to tell the difference between a real URL and an item path: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustdoc/passes/collect_intra_doc_links.rs#L277\r\n\r\nThis has caught at least one other user by surprise as well: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/cm7rhv/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/ew0nvo2/?context=1000 ", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63305/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63305/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
