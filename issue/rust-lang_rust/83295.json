We should figure out whether we actually want this\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- `&str` is nicer to work with than `SymbolStr`, e.g. avoids the need for some `&` and `&*` occurrences.\r\n- It would be nice to eliminate `SymbolStr`.\r\n- It avoids the lie that `SymbolStr` strings have a `static` lifetime, replacing it with a smaller lie that the strings have a lifetime tied to the lifetime of the input `Symbol`.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- That lifetime is still a lie, and it's possible to cause crashes with this.\r\n- The lie is less obvious in a vanilla `&str` than it is within a `SymbolStr`.\r\n- We can't mark `&str` as `!Send` and `!Sync`.\r\n   - this may be why `SymbolStr` (or what it was called previously) was introduced in the first place, because Zoxc did it together with the work on compiler parallelization.\r\n- I haven't yet eliminated `SymbolStr` entirely. The `to_stable_hash_key()` is the hardest case.\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "oli-obk", "id": 332036, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAzNg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332036?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk", "html_url": "https://github.com/oli-obk", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/83295/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/83295/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
