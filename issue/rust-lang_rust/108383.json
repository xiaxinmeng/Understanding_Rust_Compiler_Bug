People see that `-0x80000000` works and then mistakenly try to use `+0x80000000` which doesn't work because `i32` can't represent it. What we should actually do is detect when people try to type out `0x80000000i32` or `0x80i8`, etc, and have a lint that warns about this problem. I'm thinking the lint should suggest casting to the unsigned type and back, because the user is probably trying to do bit manipulation which has subtleties with signed integers.\r\n\r\n#53628, #99195, #108269", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108383/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108383/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
