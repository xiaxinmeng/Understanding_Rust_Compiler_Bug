A `#[noncopyable]` attribute that expanded to the above would be clearer and less verbose.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bstrie", "id": 865233, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTIzMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/865233?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie", "html_url": "https://github.com/bstrie", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4069/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4069/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
