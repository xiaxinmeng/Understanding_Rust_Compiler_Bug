This used to work (and iirc one of the goals of NLLs was to make this pattern work), but it broke between `nightly-2018-05-17` and `nightly-2018-05-19`. A nightly for May 18th doesn't appear to exist.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\nThis doesn't work now:\r\n```rust\r\n// Doesn't compile on nightly-2018-05-19 and later, but does on nightly-2018-05-17.\r\nfn borrow(o: &mut Option<i32>) -> Option<&mut i32> {\r\n    match o.as_mut() {\r\n        Some(i) => Some(i),\r\n        None => o.as_mut()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the other code, but *does* work both before and after `nightly-2018-05-19`\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let mut o: Option<i32> = Some(1i32);\r\n\r\n    // Compiles everywhere!\r\n    let x = match o.as_mut() {\r\n        Some(i) => Some(i),\r\n        None => o.as_mut()\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51545/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51545/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
