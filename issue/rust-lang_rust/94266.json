But neither is part of the standard process used by the compiler+release teams (and worse, not everyone on the team knows that there won't be \"one last crater run\" before release).\r\n\r\nOur current model allows us to apply last minute patches that the teams decide are warranted.  Such last minute patches are very conservative in nature, more so than typical beta backports.\r\n\r\nWe should make sure we all understand how much testing, or lack thereof, a backport to beta is going to get. We probably should also include time in the  project planning to allow for \"one last crater run\", and then use very strict backport criteria for anything that lands after that point.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94266/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94266/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
