I've reproduced this problem on both OS X and Linux, so I'm pretty sure it's not a filename issue. It also doesn't seem to matter if the crate ID is using decomposed or composed characters (or characters that only have one form).\n\nWe already have a feature gate for `non_ascii_idents`, it seems reasonable that we should feature-gate having non-ascii crate IDs as well (both implicit IDs taken from the filename, and explicit ones specified with the attribute). I don't believe we need to test any clients of such crates (using the `extern crate foo = \"f\u2107\u2107#0.0\"` syntax, as `extern crate f\u2107\u2107` already hits non_ascii_idents) because using the crate is already broken, and fixing it will not have any compatibility issues.\n\nExample:\n\nfoo.rs:\n\n``` rust\n#![crate_id=\"f\u2107\u2107#0.0\"]\n#![crate_type=\"rlib\"]\n\npub fn foo() { println!(\"foo\"); }\n```\n\nmain.rs:\n\n``` rust\nextern crate foo = \"f\u2107\u2107#0.0\";\n\nfn main() {\n    foo::foo();\n}\n```\n\nCompiling `foo.rs` works just fine, but compiling `main.rs` errors:\n\n```\nmain.rs:1:1: 1:30 error: can't find crate for `foo`\nmain.rs:1 extern crate foo = \"f\u2107\u2107#0.0\";\n          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "lilyball", "id": 714, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/714?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball", "html_url": "https://github.com/lilyball", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13412/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13412/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
