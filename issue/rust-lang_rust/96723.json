In that\r\ncase, you can use use `issue = \"none\"` in your initial implementation PR. The\r\nreviewer will ask you to open a tracking issue if they agree your feature can be\r\nadded without an RFC.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFeature gate: `#![feature(windows_process_extensions_main_thread_handle)]`\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for a new `main_thread_handle(&self)` function on a new ChildExt trait for windows.\r\nThe winapi function used to create a process on windows returns a [structure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/ns-processthreadsapi-process_information) that has both a main thread handle and a process handle. std currently [discards](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/ddb7fbe8434be481607ae199fe2aee976ee2fc2e/library/std/src/sys/windows/process.rs#L341) the thread handle, but that handle can be useful when resuming a process that was created as suspended since that is usually done with [ResumeThread](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-resumethread). Finding that thread from the process handle can be a bit convoluted, so it'd be nice if std exposed it on a windows-specific extension trait.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a short description of the feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor most library features, it'd be useful to include a summarized version of the public API.\r\n(E.g. just the public function signatures without their doc comments or implementation.)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// std::process\r\n\r\npub trait ChildExt: Sealed {\r\n    #[unstable(feature = \"windows_process_extensions_main_thread_handle\", issue = \"96723\")]\r\n    fn main_thread_handle(&self) -> RawHandle;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor larger features, more steps might be involved.\r\nIf the feature is changed later, please add those PRs here as well.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [X] Implementation: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/96725\r\n- [ ] Final comment period (FCP)\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOnce the feature has gone through a few release cycles and there are no\r\nunresolved questions left, the feature might be ready for stabilization.\r\n\r\nIf this feature didn't go through the RFC process, a final comment period\r\n(FCP) is always needed before stabilization. This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library API team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncomment period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/96723/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/96723/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
