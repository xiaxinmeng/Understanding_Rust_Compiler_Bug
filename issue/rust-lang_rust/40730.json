As I understand it, it is kept mainly for compatibility reasons:\r\n\r\n* It's used in the \"standard unix workflow\", ie. `./configure && make && make install`\r\n* which is used by linux distros shipping rust?\r\n* It's used in our ci infrastructure\r\n\r\nMaking `./configure` produce a `config.toml` file seems like a potential step in the right direction and would allow getting rid of [a nice chunk](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/bootstrap/config.rs#L404-L639) of compatibility code in rustbuild.\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n\r\n* Do we want to get rid of `./configure` in the near future? In that case making it produce a `config.toml` first is probably not worth the effort.\r\n* How complicated would it be to make `./configure` generate `config.toml`?\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40730/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 5, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40730/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
