If you take a look at these logs:\n\nhttp://buildbot.rust-lang.org/builders/auto-bsd-64-opt/builds/1029/steps/test/logs/stdio\nhttp://buildbot.rust-lang.org/builders/auto-bsd-64-opt/builds/1030/steps/test/logs/stdio\nhttp://buildbot.rust-lang.org/builders/auto-bsd-64-opt/builds/1040/steps/test/logs/stdio\nhttp://buildbot.rust-lang.org/builders/auto-bsd-64-opt/builds/1027/steps/test/logs/stdio\n\nThe problem is always that in the `test_errors_do_not_crash` test, the call to `DynamicLibrary::open` actually returns `Ok` when it should be returning `Err`. The runtime failure then happens when the destructor re-invokes `fail!()`.\n\nThis only fails sometimes, and I'm led to believe that this is a race in the `check_for_errors_in` function. This function is not thread-safe in that it is possible for one thread to get the errors of another. Basically there should not be any interleaving inside of this function, but it's a very real possibility that there is.\n\nFor now I'm going to ignore the tests, but this needs a real fix at some point.\n\ncc @sstewartgallus\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9137/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9137/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
