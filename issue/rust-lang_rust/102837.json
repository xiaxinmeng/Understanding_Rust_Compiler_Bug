The dev guide recommends\r\n```\r\n    \"rust-analyzer.rustfmt.overrideCommand\": [\r\n        \"./build/$TARGET_TRIPLE/stage0/bin/rustfmt\",\r\n        \"--edition=2021\"\r\n    ],\r\n```\r\nHowever, this command fails when rustfmt has not been extracted yet, so I often get errors from vscode here and then I have to do `x.py fmt` on the terminal by hand to make things work again. (Also the user has to figure out the right TARGET_TRIPLE themselves.)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if one could set the overrideCommand to x.py such that extracting the bootstrap rustfmt can happen automatically. However, `x.py fmt` doesn't work since ~~that always formats everything, not just a single file~~ RA does formatting via stdin/stdout, which is not how `x.py fmt` works.\r\n\r\nCc @jyn514 ", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/102837/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/102837/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "not_planned"}
