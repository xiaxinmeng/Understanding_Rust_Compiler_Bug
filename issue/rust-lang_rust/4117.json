As a result, crates make heavy use of #[path] to create directory structure.\n\nRight now we have this pattern in some crates:\n\n```\nmod foo {\n  #[path = \"foo/bar.rs\"]\n  mod bar;\n}\n```\n\n`foo` is a directory and a module containing no external source, but the parser doesn't know that foo is a directory and tries to load `bar` from `bar.rs` instead of `foo/bar.rs`. It probably makes sense to track a stack of module names in the parser and use them to decide the path to external modules. I didn't implement this at the time because it seemed like some odd state for the parser to maintain, but it is _probably_ what people expect.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "graydon", "id": 14097, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDk3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14097?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon", "html_url": "https://github.com/graydon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4117/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4117/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
