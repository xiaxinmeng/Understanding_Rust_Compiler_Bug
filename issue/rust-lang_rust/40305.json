It's worth taking another stab. I am marking this as **mentor** -- I would be happy to work with someone who is interested in pursuing it. This will be a bit of an \"exploratory\" project, so the best thing would be contact me on IRC (`nmatsakis`; privmsg me and I'll respond as soon as I see it).\r\n\r\nThe first steps, however, would be to modify the `DepTrackingMap`, e.g. [to \"freeze\" a key when `get()` returns `None`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/dep_graph/dep_tracking_map.rs#L60-L63). I would probably do this tracking only if `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` are enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40305/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40305/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
