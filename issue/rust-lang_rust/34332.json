Why don't we add `rustbook` binary as well?\n\nI have been working on [Japanese translation](https://rust-lang-ja.github.io/the-rust-programming-language-ja/1.6/book/) of The Rust Programming Language and it requires `rustbook` binary to build HTML files. On my CI environment, I am using [rustbook crate](https://crates.io/crates/rustbook), which is basically a copy of [tools/rustbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/rustbook) in this repository (rust-lang/rust). \n\nIt is not too bad but it is tedious to keep the rustbook crate up-to-date to the original in this repository. It would be much easier to me and other people using `rustbook` if the official release artifacts contain it.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "tatsuya6502", "id": 159403, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQwMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159403?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502", "html_url": "https://github.com/tatsuya6502", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34332/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34332/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
