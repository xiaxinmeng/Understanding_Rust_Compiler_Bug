But, in working on #31867, @soltanmm reminded me that this is not always true, due to the \"unify despite ambiguity\" code.\n\n**Two.** The `stalled_on` code assumes that the type of a variable will change if any progress can be made. I found this to be true even for closures -- because closures embed the types of their upvars. But this is not _always_ true. That is, for closures with no upvars, when we select a closure kind (fn vs fnonce etc), the type doesn't change at all. This became an issue in the projection cache. I was not able however to make a test case that causes a problem with for the OF, but it seems likely to be a problem eventually.\n\nUltimately I expect the right fix for problem two is to expose the Closure Kind as part of the closure type, so that indeed the fully resolved type _always_ changes. It seems very convenient to be able to use the fully resolved type as a cache key and not fear silent background changes.\n\nThe fix for problem one is just to refactor a bit I think to expose that information better. The only effect it has is when the OF will decide it has reached a fix point and stop trying to call select.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "arielb1", "id": 1830974, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzA5NzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1830974?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1", "html_url": "https://github.com/arielb1", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/32286/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/32286/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
