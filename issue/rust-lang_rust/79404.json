This used to select the `selectors` and `stylo_tests` crates, whose dependency graph include most Servo crates that don\u2019t rely on unstable language or std features.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/54451#issuecomment-427548626 `stylo_tests` was removed. This in turn greatly reduced the coverage of what ends up being compiled during this test, since `stylo_tests` depended on the `style` crate which is one of the big components. With only the `selectors` crate and its dependency graph, much less of Servo is compiled which makes including Servo in `cargotest` less useful. On the other hand, compiling more stuff might increase the time taken by CI.\r\n\r\nSome options here are:\r\n\r\n* Add `style_tests` (note `e` v.s. `o`), which depends on the `style` crate, to the crates being tested in order to restore test coverage to roughly what it was before #54451\r\n* Remove Servo entirely from `cargotest` in order to reduce CI time spent cloning a large repository only to compile a small part\r\n* No functional change, but remove this comment which is outdated since #54451:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b387f62d4d0e9aa109660c6ede426ec48cb67d53/src/tools/cargotest/main.rs#L48-L49", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79404/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79404/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
