The starting point was apparently this [thread on the Git Mailing List](https://lore.kernel.org/git/CAOAHyQwyXC1Z3v7BZAC+Bq6JBaM7FvBenA-1fcqeDV==apdWDg@mail.gmail.com/), which, as far as I know, brought the topic up for the first time. It is criticized that the term \"master\" might have a negative connotation for people who were directly or indirectly affected by slavery. \r\n\r\nI think that especially in the light of the fact that the Rust Community is known for its openness towards all ethics and minorities, serious consideration should be given to renaming the master branch correspondingly. The GitHub CEO himself has already expressed his support for the idea (see [this tweet](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1271253144442253312?s=19)), and the official GitHub cli repository has also already been changed accordingly.\r\nCurrently, it seems that the following two are the most common alternatives to the term \"master\":\r\n- trunk\r\n- main\r\n\r\nGitHub has chosen the term trunk for the cli repository. Whether the name of the master branch of this repository should be changed accordingly should be discussed. I'm open to any constructive opinions on this topic.", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73385/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 1, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73385/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
