I *need* the error message, however I can't get it without the nightly `PanicInfo.message()`. There is no reason I should be forced to use nightly to use such a basic feature.\r\n\r\nI get why it may have not been stabilized immediately, but `.message()` [was basically left to die in 2019](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66745) and my panic handler is 100% useless without `.message()` since panics using core have no payload.\r\n\r\nIt is very frustrating to develop a substantial firmware and not have a user friendly panic handler without relying on unstable features, especially since *`.message()` has been unstable for over 4 years*.
