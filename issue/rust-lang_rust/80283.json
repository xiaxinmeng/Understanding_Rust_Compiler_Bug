Currently it links to the method.\n    fn bar(&self) -> i32 { self.bar }\n}\n```\n\nThis is a decently-common Rust \"design pattern\" where you have have a private\nfield but give public read-only access via a method of the same name. However,\nthere's no way in rustdoc currently to disambiguate between the function and the\nfield. Rustdoc seems to always link to the method in this case.\n\nIt would be good if we had a disambiguator for struct/enum fields: something\nlike `field@Foo::bar`. I don't think it's necessary to have a different one for\nstruct vs enum variant fields, but we should still decide that since intra-doc\nlinks are now stable (and thus we can't remove things).\n\n*See the discussion [on Zulip][z].*\n\ncc @jyn514\n\n[z]: https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/266220-rustdoc/topic/intra-doc.20link.20to.20field\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80283/reactions", "total_count": 7, "+1": 7, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80283/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
