Notably, lang items are collected after lowering but it is sometimes desirable to refer to them. @eddyb suggested a side table mapping HIR node IDs to prospective lang items, which would be cross-referenced with the real lang items once they are collected. But this relies on IDs being known during lowering. Currently they are, because they are [copied from the AST IDs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_front/lowering.rs#L964), but @eddyb was saying that the AST shouldn't have IDs at all. Currently it is needed because lowering [needs to be reproducible](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_front/lowering.rs#L27-L34), but... why? Are these IDs going away, or are they here to stay and usable for this lang item scheme?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "oli-obk", "id": 332036, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAzNg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332036?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk", "html_url": "https://github.com/oli-obk", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30809/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30809/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
