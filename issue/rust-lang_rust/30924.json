This could be vastly improved so that it is actually a useful for the user:\n- use type ascription rather than comments\n- map the types back from the HIR to the AST\n- use the original program's formatting (or if that isn't possible, use rustfmt, rather than the pretty printer)\n- output only a specified portion of the program, rather than the whole program\n\nIf we do all of those things, then this should probably be a tool external to the compiler. The first item could just fix `--unpretty=hir,typed`, the second could provide `--unpretty=typed`.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30924/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30924/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
