How do I have operation parameters but \"malformed\" data? What even _is_ a parameter in this case? I know a parameter as an input to a function, but Rust is supposed to typecheck my problems, so how do they happen? Is it because of raw pointer stuff perchance? I don't really know from looking at that documentation, and I'm hopelessly confused.\n\nBut because I'm hopelessly confused, I thought I'd look for a link to some usage of these kinds - learn by example. But there's no linking to functions that might return these variants specifically that I can go to and read their documentation. I think these links would be invaluable for what is probably going to be the most read error page in the standard library documentation.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27637/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27637/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
