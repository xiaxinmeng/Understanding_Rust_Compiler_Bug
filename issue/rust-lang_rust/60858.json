I\u2019m still working on making it build end to end at least reach stage 2. Once it can build, I\u2019d like to have it built in rust master, so user can simply rustup add target to get it.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m looking at aarch64-pc-windows-msvc, it\u2019s built, but not tested, I\u2019d like to achieve the same availability for thumbv7a. So what it takes to get me there?\r\n\r\nI did a rough search, here\u2019s thumbv7a in rust master, 2 files,\r\n(https://github.com/search?l=&q=thumbv7a-pc-windows-msvc+user%3Arust-lang+repo%3Arust&type=Code)\r\n\r\nAnd here\u2019s aarch64 in rust master, 8 files,\r\n(https://github.com/search?l=&q=aarch64-pc-windows-msvc+user%3Arust-lang+repo%3Arust&type=Code)\r\n\r\nDoes it mean give or take, I need to add least make changes to the other 6 files to align with aarch64? Please advise.\r\n\r\nI also posted the same question in the forum, https://users.rust-lang.org/t/how-to-add-a-new-component-triple-that-can-be-built-by-the-official-branch-nightly/28267, please let me know which one is better for this ask.", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60858/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60858/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
