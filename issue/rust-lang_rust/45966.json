On most platforms, this is *without* `--with-jemalloc-prefix`, which causes jemalloc to define an unprefixed `malloc` symbol that \"overrides\" libc\u2019s and ends up being used by `alloc_system`.\r\n\r\nSo `alloc_system` doesn\u2019t do what the name suggests, in this situation.\r\n\r\nLike https://github.com/alexcrichton/jemallocator/issues/19 this problem will disappear when `alloc_jemalloc` is eventually removed, but in the meantime `alloc_system` doesn\u2019t always do what the name says it does.\r\n\r\nWe stopped prefixing jemalloc symbols in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31460 in order to make LLVM use them. Could we perhaps only do this when compiling a compiler? Or perhaps the compiler could switch to using the `jemallocator` crate, which would gain a Cargo feature flag to disable prefixing? It would do something like that anyway to keep that LLVM+jemalloc benefit when `alloc_jemalloc` is removed and the default for executables is changed to `alloc_system`.\r\n\r\nCC @alexcrichton ", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45966/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45966/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
