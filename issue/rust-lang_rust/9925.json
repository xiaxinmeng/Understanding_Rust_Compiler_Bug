My investigation involved breaking on `uv_fs_open` and then seeing what happened. One of the first things that this function does is invoke `strdup`, which is then later deallocated with `free`. I followed these calls to figure out which malloc (part of strdup) and free were getting used. This data was all collected by running `./$platform/stage0/bin/rustc` and just seeing what happened.\n\n| platform | malloc | free | `global_heap::malloc_raw` | `global_heap::exchange_free` |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| x86_64-unknown-linux | jemalloc | jemalloc | jemalloc | jemalloc |\n| i686-unknown-linux | libc | jemalloc | libc | libc |\n| x86_64-apple-darwin | libc | libc | ? | ? |\n| i686-apple-darwin | libc | libc | ? | ? |\n\nIt appears that 32-bit linux is the worst off where the allocator is being mismatched, but I'm not certain that it's _not_ being mismatched on other platforms.\n## ORIGINAL REPORT\n\nI was stepping through i386 linux recently, and got this backtrace:\n\n```\nBreakpoint 8, __GI___libc_malloc (bytes=16) at malloc.c:2910                                                        \n2910    malloc.c: No such file or directory.                                                                        \n(gdb) bt                                                                                                            \n#0  __GI___libc_malloc (bytes=16) at malloc.c:2910                                                                  \n#1  0xf7ac196f in rt::global_heap::malloc_raw::hbc5969e10a864a8a4::v0.9$x2dpre ()                                   \n   from /home/alex/rust/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage1/lib/rustc/i686-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/libstd-6c65cf4b443341b1\n-0.9-pre.so                                                                                                         \n#2  0xf7b6124e in rt::uv::uvio::EventLoop$UvEventLoop::remote_callback::h14d1de56cbaf539eaVaQ::v0.9$x2dpre ()       \n   from /home/alex/rust/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage1/lib/rustc/i686-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/libstd-6c65cf4b443341b1\n-0.9-pre.so                                                                                                         \n#3  0xf7b00d66 in rt::sched::Scheduler::make_handle::hfe732d5489154f1873aL::v0.9$x2dpre ()                          \n   from /home/alex/rust/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage1/lib/rustc/i686-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/libstd-6c65cf4b443341b1\n-0.9-pre.so                                                                                                         \n#4  0xf7b5bae1 in rt::sched::Scheduler::run_sched_once::hf3525925b944a5173a8::v0.9$x2dpre ()                        \n   from /home/alex/rust/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage1/lib/rustc/i686-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/libstd-6c65cf4b443341b1\n-0.9-pre.so                                                                                                         \n#5  0xf7b71896 in rt::uv::uvio::__extensions__::start::anon::expr_fn::aq ()                                         \n   from /home/alex/rust/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage1/lib/rustc/i686-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/libstd-6c65cf4b443341b1\n```\n\nThis appears to indicate that we are not using jemalloc for the exchange or managed heaps. I did see jemalloc get used by libuv though (but jemalloc is linked statically to libuv)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9925/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9925/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
