Please leave comments!\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a list of known issues we plan to address. Likely many of these will be moved into distinct GitHub issues at some point. \r\n\r\nImprovements to the overall error reporting mechanism:\r\n- [x] New unit testing mechanism that can test colors and precise appearance: #33000 \r\n- [ ] Improve the [treatment of tabs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32756#issuecomment-213040791).\r\n- [ ] Subdiagnostics like `note` should [not be colored green](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32756#issuecomment-212678332) but rather just appear bold\r\n- [ ] Subdiagnostics like `note` should not use the `-->` indicator but rather `>>>`, and the underline should be `--` and not `^^`\r\n  - basically, they do not have a primary span\r\n- [ ] Mandatory labels on primary spans?\r\n- [ ] Change from `>>>>` for secondary file names to something like `:::` maybe?\r\n- [ ] When snippet labels are too long, potentially move them to a footnote of some kind\r\n\r\nSpecific error messages that need improvement:\r\n- [ ] Identify when you have the same span for multiple borrows in a loop and give a better message.\r\n- [ ] We special case closure captures due to unique loans, but we could give similar treatment to any loan coming through a capture.\r\n- [ ] Decide whether to thread the closure header span through the builder API convenience methods.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33240/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33240/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
