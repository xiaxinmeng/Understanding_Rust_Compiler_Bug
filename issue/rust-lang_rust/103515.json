For other problems the connection was already owned, but the key was a Cow<'key, str> to avoid allocation when unneeded.\r\nThe [constructor](https://github.com/nappa85/logic-lock/blob/cow/src/lib.rs#L107) accepted S: Into<Cow<'key, str>>, so you can pass in even a static str or a String, no problems.\r\n\r\nEverything was looking good, mi lib crates using that struct built fine, until I plugged it into my warp webserver, at this point I've got my higher-ranked lifetime error.\r\nYou can test yourself in this project where I've replicated the problem: https://github.com/nappa85/hrtb-error\r\n\r\nTo solve the problem, I've converted the Cow<'key, str> into a String and removed the lifetime from my struct.\r\nTo test the solution you simply have to change the pointed branch from \"cow\" to \"owned\" inside [Cargo.toml](https://github.com/nappa85/hrtb-error/blob/master/Cargo.toml#L10)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103515/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103515/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
