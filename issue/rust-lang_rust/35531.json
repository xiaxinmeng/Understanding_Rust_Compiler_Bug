This is wasteful and results in a good deal of code bloat. Can we do better (with MIR perhaps)?\n\nOne possible sketch of a solution is to implement MIR inlining and then use some variant of #32966 that can prove that the construction of the argument to `push()` does not touch the vector, enabling us to forward the move from the stack to the destination of `ptr::write()`.\n\nAn alternative would be to implement rust-lang/rfcs#1426.\n\ncc @eddyb @nikomatsakis \n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/35531/reactions", "total_count": 7, "+1": 7, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/35531/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
