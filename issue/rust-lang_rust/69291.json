And then, usually, delete them.\r\n\r\nBut this should not be necessary. `tidy` should be smart enough to run `git status` itself and use that to drive its traversal.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n(*) part of the above process is the build system will automatically update submodules. But old directories from old (outdated) submodule checkouts still stick around.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69291/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69291/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
