However, `query_dsl::boxed_dsl::BoxedDsl` is a public item which has no documentation on it, and should be triggering the lint. I can even go in and add `#[deny(missing_docs)]` to that trait directly, and the lint still doesn't fire.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what other information I can add -- This is not specific to this one lint in this one case, we've had tons of cases of lints which should have always been failing randomly starting to fail due to changes in completely unrelated code.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46695/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46695/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
