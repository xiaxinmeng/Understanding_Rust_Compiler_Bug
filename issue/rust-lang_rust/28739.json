It'd be good to have a few major points that the text covers highlighted at the top, perhaps with bullet points or something.\n- The crate is the compilation unit; modules are subordinate to the crate\n- One cargo unit typically contains up to 2 crates:\n  - a `lib.rs` crate for the library\n  - a `main.rs` crate for the binary\n- Interaction across crates is handled via `extern crate` command\n- `mod foo.rs` and `mod foo { ... }` are equivalent except:\n  - `mod { ... }` puts the contents inside the braces\n  - `mod foo.rs;` requests `cargo` find the contents in either:\n    - `foo.rs`\n    - `foo/mod.rs`\n- Modules are private by default. Make them public with `pub`\n- Namespace importation is handled via `use`:\n  - Relative paths:\n    - `use foo::bar`;: use `bar` inside of `foo`\n    - `use foo::bar::baz;`: use `baz` inside of `bar` inside of `foo`\n    - `use foo::{bar, baz};`: use `bar` and `baz` which are both inside `foo`\n    - `use foo::*;`: use all names inside `foo`\n    - `use foo::{self, bar};`: use `bar` inside `foo` and module `foo`\n  - Absolute paths:\n    - `use ::foo::bar;` use `bar` inside of `foo` which is at the crate root\n  - Renames are allowed:\n    - `use foo as tofu;`: use `foo` under the name `tofu`\n\nI tried to skim the page looking for all the major points. Maybe I grabbed too many but if this table was at the top, it might help people not miss things so easily. Probably would be useful other places too.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28739/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28739/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
