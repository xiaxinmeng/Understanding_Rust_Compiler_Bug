https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/101011 probably needs reverting before 1.65 hits stable, or Rust apps may[^1] fail AppStore review on iOS and tvOS.\n\nApparently, `getentropy` on Darwin platforms is actually only considered public API on MacOS. This is surprising, since there are several indications to the contrary:\n\n1. In the declaration in the public header (`sys/random.h`) on MacOS, it has a availability annotation that indicates it's fine in iOS/tvOS 10.0 and watchOS 3.0:\n\n    ```c\n    int getentropy(void* buffer, size_t size) __OSX_AVAILABLE(10.12) __IOS_AVAILABLE(10.0) __TVOS_AVAILABLE(10.0) __WATCHOS_AVAILABLE(3.0);\n    ```\n\n2. Apple's [security guidelines](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/random-number-generation-seca0c73a75b/web) say to use it for random number generation.\n\nSadly, does seem to indeed be true that `sys/random.h` does not exist in any of the platform SDKs aside from MacOSX.sdk, and it also seems to have lead to one to iOS App Store [rejection](https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/issues/668). TBH, it being an accidentally missing file feels plausible, but who knows and it doesn't matter anyway.\n\nThis is a bummer, and I guess now I know, I can't really trust the the available annotations anymore.\n\n[^1]: There's actually a good chance that our use of `weak!` evades this detection, but I don't want to rely on this or make random Rust apps test it for us.\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"BlackHoleFox\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/102643/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 4, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/102643/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
