According to the [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-manifest-format), you can add all sorts of details about the project itself like a description etc. \r\n\r\nHowever, when newer users (and others) see `2018` for the `edition` field, they are confused by what the `version` field means. \r\n\r\nIs `version` the rust version that the software or crate runs on or is the `edition` the edition the crate or software is currently in or is `edition` the year during which the software or crate was published?\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nThis problem can be tackled easily.
