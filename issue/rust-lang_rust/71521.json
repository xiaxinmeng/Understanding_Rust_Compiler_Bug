Therefore I propose to add such a facility to the standard library.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind the name is that this is a facility that statically guarantees mutual exclusion.", "closed_by": {"login": "rkuhn", "id": 470469, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDQ2OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/470469?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuhn", "html_url": "https://github.com/rkuhn", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuhn/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuhn/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuhn/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuhn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuhn/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuhn/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuhn/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuhn/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkuhn/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/71521/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/71521/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
