However, this is not helpful to users who do not know O-notation, and `n` is generally either misleading or undefined.\r\n\r\n [`String::insert_str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.insert_str): The operation is really `O(n-idx+k)`, where `n` is the length of `self`, and `k` is the length of `string`. In fact, that's not even true if the String needs to be resized. If we wanted to cover that, we'd need to include the \"amortized\" qualifier in there. `O(n)` is insufficient in part because if `k` is large and `n` is small, `k` is much more important. We probably want to ditch the O-notation here entirely, and just explain that it needs to shift everything after `idx` over, and copy in the characters from `string`, and that this operation may be slow because of it.\r\n\r\n[`String::insert`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.insert) and [`String::remove`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.remove): These are less egregious since `O(n)` is correct. However, the smaller bound of `O(n-idx)` can be given, and the difference might be significant. Here too, it'd be better to just get rid of the O-notation altogether and explain what happens instead.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46650/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 0, "-1": 4, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46650/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
