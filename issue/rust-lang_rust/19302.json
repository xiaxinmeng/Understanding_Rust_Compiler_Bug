References just borrow ownership, which is more polite if you don't need the ownership. In other words, prefer:\n> \n> `fn succ(x: &int) -> int { *x + 1 }`\n> \n> to\n> \n> `fn succ(x: Box<int>) -> int { *x + 1 }`\n> \n> As a corollary to that rule, references allow you to accept a wide variety of other pointers, and so are useful so that you don't have to write a number of variants per pointer. In other words, prefer:\n> \n> `fn succ(x: &int) -> int { *x + 1 }`\n> \n> to\n> \n> `fn box_succ(x: Box<int>) -> int { *x + 1 }`\n> \n> `fn rc_succ(x: std::rc::Rc<int>) -> int { *x + 1 }`\n\nIn the past, a function accepting `&int` could seamlessly accept an input of type `Box<int>` (or `~int`, rather), what we (I think) we used to call auto-cross-borrowing. But in today's rust you must deref-and-borrow at the call site manually via `&*`.
