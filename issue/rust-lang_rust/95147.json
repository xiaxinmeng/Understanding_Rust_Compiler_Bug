impossible in this case--something can't be both `FnMut(i32)` and `FnOnce(&i32)`), but we should at least render the `FnOnce` trait syntax right.\n\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\n```\nrustc 1.61.0-nightly (8d60bf427 2022-03-19)\nbinary: rustc\ncommit-hash: 8d60bf427a4b055f464122062e76b3ec34d4f8ba\ncommit-date: 2022-03-19\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nrelease: 1.61.0-nightly\nLLVM version: 14.0.0\n```\n\nI cannot seem to find any place to start a bisection, so as far as I can tell this behaviour has always been present.\n\nThis code is an MCVE of the following less contrived case (using a bit of truncated code, as the exact details of the implementation of this lexer-like structure are not too important), found by @slavfox:\n```\nstruct Foo;\n\nimpl Foo {\n    fn peek(&self) -> Option<char> { todo!() }\n    fn advance(&mut self) { todo!() }\n    fn eat_while(&mut self, predicate: impl FnMut(char) -> bool) -> String {\n        let mut buf = String::new();\n        while let Some(ch) = self.peek().filter(predicate) {\n            buf.push(ch);\n            self.advance();\n        }\n        buf\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI tested this and it does not seem like the `~const`ness of the trait bounds of `Option::filter` affect the overall diagnostic rendering.\n\nI may try to fix this in a PR if I can find out why it is occurring.\n\n@rustbot label:
