Shift operators are defined for signed RHS types**\nThe following fails to compile: `1u32 << -1i32`; this compiles: `let i = -1i32; 1u32 << i` but panics due to overflow in debug mode and evaluates to `0` or `2147483648` in release mode, depending on whether the `u32` value is even or odd (which leads me to believe that internally the signed value is just cast to an unsigned one).\n\nMy preferred solution would be to remove the Sh\\* impls for signed RHS types, but I understand that this might not be possible due to backwards compatibility reasons. If this is the case I would vote for fixing the signed impls by conditionally calling the opposite or some other way because the current behaviour is pretty bad in my opinion.\n\n**2. The shift impl of `Wrapping` is not wrapping**\nThe Sh\\* operators for Wrapping are currently only defined for `usize` as the RHS (because of #23545) with the plan to support all integer types as the RHS once that issue is fixed. This is not a problem, however the current implementation is because it is implemented using the `<<` and `>>` operators on the primitive value, which does obviously not perform a wrapping shift.\n\nThe solution would obviously be to use the `wrapping_sh*` method on the primitive types, however they are only defined for a `RHS = u32`, which would require some nontrivial logic to convert `usize` (on 64bit platforms) to that `u32`.\n\nFurthermore, I found that there is currently no way to solve the problem (in stable rust) which originally caused me to discover these issues: Given `1u8 << 8` I want to get `0` as a result without panicking and ideally without reimplementing `std::num::wrapping::OverflowingOps` which is currently unstable (and even if used would still require a condition on my part).\n## \n\nI would love to hear some opinions on these issues and would be open to implement a solution, if found / required.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27601/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27601/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
