So I want to make a change, recompile as fast as possible and test the new binary with some input.rs.\n### The Problem\n\n`make` rebuilds libstd even if it's unchanged. This takes ages and can't be skipped.\n### How to reproduce\n\nI'm on Fedora Linux 23, fully updated.\n\nI started with a clone of the rust repo, in which I already compiled rustc more than once (so LLVM was already built etc.).\n\n```\ngit reset --hard 298730e   # this is the commit I used for this test\ngit clean -df\n```\n\n```\n./configure --enable-debug\n```\n\n[output](https://gist.github.com/flo-l/5071682c95af0d5320c7b153bf841732)\n\n```\nmake rustc-stage1 NO_REBUILD=1\n```\n\n[output](https://gist.github.com/flo-l/32a9dff2816141733dc2c820d2d84a9d)\n\n```\ntouch src/librustc_mir/lib.rs\n```\n\n```\nmake rustc-stage1 NO_REBUILD=1\n```\n\n[output](https://gist.github.com/flo-l/965e2bd30d84b52578fe5a4cbbb0fb99)\n\nAs you can see in the output of the second make command libstd, libcore etc. get rebuilt.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33990/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33990/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
