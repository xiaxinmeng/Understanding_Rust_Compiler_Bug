There is no conceptual reason for collections and allocation to be in the same crate. It seems to have been done to solve a language limitation, for the enablement of a fairly marginal feature. The tradeoff does not seem worth it to me.\r\n\r\n- It forces any no_std projects that want allocation to also take collections with it. There are presumably use cases for wanting allocator support without the Rust collections design (we know the collections are insufficient for some use cases).\r\n\r\n- It gives the std collections crate special capabilities that other collections may not implement themselves - no other collections will be able to achieve feature parity with the conversion this merger is meant to enable.\r\n\r\nPersonally I value the decomposition of the standard library into individual reusable components and think the merge is moving in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nI am curious to know what embedded and os developers think of this merge cc @japaric @jackpot51 .\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "aturon", "id": 709807, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTgwNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/709807?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon", "html_url": "https://github.com/aturon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43112/reactions", "total_count": 15, "+1": 10, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 5, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43112/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
