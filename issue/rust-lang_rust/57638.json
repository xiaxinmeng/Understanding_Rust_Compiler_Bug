The [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.29.0/std/panic/struct.PanicInfo.html) points to an issue that is closed (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44489).\r\n\r\nRelated to the following issues in Firecracker:\r\n- [pretty-printing panics](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/837)\r\n- [user inquiry](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/836)\r\n\r\nIs there another recommended way to get the panic information? I was also thinking about replacing the panic_hook with catch_unwind but we might get into problems if the external crates that we are using are implementing panic with abort.", "closed_by": {"login": "andreeaflorescu", "id": 2815944, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTU5NDQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2815944?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu", "html_url": "https://github.com/andreeaflorescu", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57638/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57638/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
