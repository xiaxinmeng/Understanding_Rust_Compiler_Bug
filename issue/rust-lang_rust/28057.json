For example, below is a mockup of what the main [regex page](http://doc.rust-lang.org/regex/regex/index.html) would look like with and without the types which can only be created indirectly. Clearly the top part is much more approachable to someone unfamiliar with this library.\n\n![std_overview_comparison](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4156987/9537503/194c88cc-4d07-11e5-8e89-a6ca7652fbf8.png)\n\nThis seems a somewhat reasonable thing to do although I'm not certain `expand/overview` are the best words or icons for this but it seems okay I guess. One alternative would be to only show indirectly created types where they're being returned (but that is more drastic and it seems it could be done after this was tried if this was really well liked).\n\ncc @BurntSushi since this interested you\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28057/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28057/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
