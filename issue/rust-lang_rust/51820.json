Most of that time, based on `perf annotate` results, seems to be spent in and around the `SmallVec` operations (e.g., `push` and `into_iter`). The tricky part here is that the `Place` data structures we are using are setup as a kind of tree, so that `x.a.b` is sort of like this:\r\n\r\n- Projection of `b` from:\r\n  - Projection of `a` from:\r\n    - Local variable `x`\r\n\r\nBut we want to iterate \"bottom up\", so `x`, then `a`, then `b`. This doesn't lend itself to a simple iterator so we currently build up a `SmallVec` of results. \r\n\r\nIt might be a win instead to build up a (stack-allocated) linked list by recursively \"unrolling\" the paths for both sides. Or perhaps dong other experiments, such as sharing a `Vec` buffer (that seemed a bit tricky from a type perspective when I looked into it).\r\n\r\nLonger term, I'd like to move away from using `Place` here (and perhaps change how `Place` is setup in MIR) but it seems worth trying to tackle this in a targeted way.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51820/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51820/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
