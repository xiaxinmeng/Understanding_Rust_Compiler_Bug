Visit, e.g. https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/trait.ToString.html\r\n2. Open Chrome Developer Tools\r\n3. Click the Sources tab, then main1.56.0.js.\r\n4. Click the first line of main1.56.0.js to set a breakpoint.\r\n5. Reload.\r\n6. Notice that the search box is grey, but it will later become white.\r\n\r\n![flicker-on-load](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/220205/138618190-49434c71-fd9f-4213-b996-cc9e3c80b07b.png)\r\n\r\nThe search box has for a long time been disabled on page load, until the JS runs. It being grey is a side effect of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/85367. Before that, our `search-focus:disabled` style wasn't getting applied. After that, it is. As a quick fix I think we should remove the grey styling on the disabled search bar. I know this means that no-JS users won't have as good a visual indication that the search bar is disabled. Perhaps we should address this by having styles inside a `<noscript>` tag that hide the search bar entirely.\r\n\r\nIt's good to minimize the number of changes that happen during page load - this reduces visual distractions and help page loads feel fast.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90246/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90246/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
