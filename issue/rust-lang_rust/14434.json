It needs to be either a compile error in some way (`once fn stdin()`!?) or calling `stdin()` multiple times must be safe. (Causing task failure, \u201cyou\u2019ve already called stdin()!\u201d, would probably not be considered acceptable.)\n\nOne suggestion is to switch it to using task-local storage. This is imperfect (reading stdin from multiple tasks is broken), but generally acceptable.\n\nHaving stdin/stdout/stderr as true globals in some way is another possibility.\n\nYet another suggestion, aired by @o11c, is passing stdin, stdout and stderr as arguments to `main`. (There are certainly significant difficulties with that scheme.)\n\nThis needs to be fixed urgently. It appears to be tripping up a significant number of people and is very much non-obvious.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/14434/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/14434/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
