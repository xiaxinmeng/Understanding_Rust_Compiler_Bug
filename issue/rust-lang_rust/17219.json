The pre-install path comes from that library's `LC_ID_DYLIB`.\n\nThe binary does not run, but so far that's expected behavior and setting `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` works.  However, as far as I can tell, `-C rpath` is supposed to make a binary with the correct path built in.  It does not.  It adds a `-rpath` entry, but on OS X, `-rpath` is documented as follows:\n\n```\n     -rpath path\n                 Add path to the runpath search path list for image being created.  At runtime, dyld uses the runpath when searching for dylibs whose load path begins with\n                 @rpath/.\n```\n\nWhile `LC_RPATH` shows up in the binary, the `LC_LOAD_DYLIB` load paths are the same old `x86_64-apple-darwin/etc/etc`, so the rpath is not used and nothing changes.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "comex", "id": 47517, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NTE3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47517?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/comex", "html_url": "https://github.com/comex", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/comex/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/comex/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/comex/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/comex/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/comex/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/comex/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/comex/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/comex/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/comex/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/17219/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/17219/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
