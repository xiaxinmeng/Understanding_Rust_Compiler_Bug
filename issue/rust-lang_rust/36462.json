Rust got rid of them but keeps paths?? You can't be serious.   \n\nIt's the same old Linux and C refrain over and over again: \"let's mess up (f*ck) the newbies, tadada\". It's institutionalized trolling, by peple \"in the know\". For you have to know. So sure to \"always keep the pitfalls! Add with an upbeat intonation: \"That's what the command-line is for!\".  \n\nNeither the download page nor the installer hint at the damn C-compiler needed. Installer doesn't even check. \n\nLousy first and surely lasting impressions. \n", "closed_by": {"login": "InovaWiki", "id": 21952779, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTUyNzc5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21952779?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/InovaWiki", "html_url": "https://github.com/InovaWiki", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/InovaWiki/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/InovaWiki/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/InovaWiki/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/InovaWiki/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/InovaWiki/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/InovaWiki/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/InovaWiki/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/InovaWiki/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/InovaWiki/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36462/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36462/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
