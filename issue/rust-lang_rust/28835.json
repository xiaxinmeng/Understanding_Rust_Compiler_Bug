I'm just reading through The Rust Programming Language Book (TRPL) and I noticed usage of the word 'just' a few times: \"e.g. just install this thing\". I've written a bit on this word but to keep it short; I feel that this is quite a loaded word and we could do better without it. In most cases, the work could be to remove 'just' where appropriate from the book, where I often then realise its use wasn't needed at all.\n\nSomewhere else I wrote, which gives some explanation of my reasoning:\n\n> Avoid use of \"easy\", \"simple\" and \"just\". If you tell me something is easy and I don't understand it, I feel alienated. What is easy to you is not easy to other people. \n\nPS. I took me a long time to find the TRPL source, and maybe we could add a link to the source in the book itself at the beginning? I'm not familiar with the pull request process here (and judging by the CONTRIBUTING.md it's a lengthy one!) so I didn't feel confident to jump in and do it myself (yet?).\n\nStay cool, thank you for the book!\n\n\u2600\ufe0f\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28835/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28835/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
