We should create a dep-node also for each partition. These dep-nodes will not have a `DefId` but rather the string representing the partition name. They will have incoming edges from the trans of each individual item -- some trans items, such as drop glue, may not have their own individual item and can just be lumped under the partition node. \n\nUpon startup, when the dep-node for a partition is deemed to be dirty, we will also delete the associated `.o` file from the disk. The same is true if the hash of the partition contents (cc #34037) changes. \n\nOne question: could it somehow happen (I don't think so...but maybe?) that a partition just ceases to exist, but none of the inputs change? I guess one example might be changing the partition strategy? We may just want to do a little walk over the graph and delete extra nodes.\n\ncc @michaelwoerister \n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34038/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34038/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
