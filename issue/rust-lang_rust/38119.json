Our travis builds rely on ccache for speedy LLVM builds, but they're all building the same thing all the time and the cache is massively duplicated and taking up tons of space. Additionally, we can unify our \"LLVM caching strategies\" by using ssccache on Windows where we're doing a different caching strategy with AppVeyor.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of such a transition I see are:\r\n\r\n* Unifying Travis/AppVeyor LLVM caching\r\n* Perhaps being speedier as a too-large cache wouldn't be downloaded on Travis builds (I'm not sure we ever clean this out...)\r\n* Maybe being useful for contributors, as everyone's basically compiling the same LLVM code, so we could speed up everyone else's builds\r\n* More Rust!\r\n\r\ncc @luser ", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38119/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38119/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
