At least on macOS it causes the following message to be printed when testing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: process didn't exit successfully: `/binary/path` (signal: 4, SIGILL: illegal instruction)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nTo me this doesn't say that the process was aborted, in fact I though this was a problem with the code being generated. Only after running the code with lldb did I find out that this was actually caused by a call to `abort`.\r\n\r\nSo my suggestion is to add some minimal logging that the process was aborted, atleast in debug mode. Just a minimal \"aborted process\" would done. Maybe this needs a RFC, but I though to start small.\r\n\r\nP.S: is the printed error message any better on other Oses?", "closed_by": {"login": "Thomasdezeeuw", "id": 3159064, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTkwNjQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3159064?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Thomasdezeeuw", "html_url": "https://github.com/Thomasdezeeuw", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Thomasdezeeuw/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Thomasdezeeuw/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Thomasdezeeuw/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Thomasdezeeuw/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Thomasdezeeuw/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Thomasdezeeuw/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Thomasdezeeuw/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Thomasdezeeuw/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Thomasdezeeuw/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52633/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52633/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
