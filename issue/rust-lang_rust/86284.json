I spent a long while looking and it appears to be *similar* to #24159 (resolved by #81671), but not quite the same (and this behavior is still present).\r\n\r\n## Rustc version\r\n\r\nBoth current stable (1.52.1) and nightly (1.55.0-nightly (2021-06-12 24bdc6d73a75dce9a701)) fail to compile the following code.\r\n\r\n## Minimal example\r\n\r\n([playground link](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=e4434f00707b14a419f9ca99d162006a))\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Foo {\r\n    // There isn't anything special about `Clone` here; it just happens to be\r\n    // a trait we can bound this by.\r\n    type Bar: Clone;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Because `<F as Foo>::Bar = B`, and `Foo::Bar: Clone`, we'd expect that this\r\n// also requires `B: Clone`.\r\nfn do_thing<F, B>(bar: B) where F: Foo<Bar = B> {\r\n    // rustc says that `B` does not implement clone, so there is no `.clone()`\r\n    // method we can call here.\r\n    bar.clone();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI used a function to create the bound conflict here, but it works in a variety of other contexts as well -- I first noticed it in an impl block with the call to `clone` in one of the methods.\r\n\r\nEssentially, the issue seems to be that the compiler is failing to make the following deduction:\r\n\r\n> trait `Foo` with `Foo::Bar: MyTrait` and `T: Foo<Bar = B>` implies `B: MyTrait`\r\n\r\nIf there's anything I can do, I'm happy to help where possible.", "closed_by": {"login": "jonas-schievink", "id": 1786438, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY0Mzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786438?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonas-schievink", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86284/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86284/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
