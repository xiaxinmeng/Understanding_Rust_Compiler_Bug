This seems ideal for `Instant`. CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW appears to prevent slewing or jumping, closer matching user expectations about `Instant` (despite the fact that Instant is explicitly allowed to jump forward and slew)\r\n\r\nThis wasn't done earlier due to Rust's minimum supported Linux kernel version (now 2.6.32) since CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW was added in 2.6.28. See also #37902\r\n\r\nI'd also like to change thread::sleep's implementation to use clock_nanosleep(`CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW`) from it's current `nanosleep()`. Note that\r\n\r\n> POSIX.1 specifies that nanosleep() should measure time against the CLOCK_REALTIME clock. However, Linux measures the time using the CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock.\r\n\r\nfrom [linux.die](https://linux.die.net/man/2/nanosleep). This has negative implications for the implementation of thread::sleep on BSD, which should probably use CLOCK_MONOTONIC.\r\n\r\nOf course, CLOCK_MONATONIC_RAW is Linux-specific, so other Unix platforms will still use CLOCK_MONATONIC", "closed_by": {"login": "maxbla", "id": 13515803, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTE1ODAz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13515803?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/maxbla", "html_url": "https://github.com/maxbla", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maxbla/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maxbla/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maxbla/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maxbla/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maxbla/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maxbla/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maxbla/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maxbla/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maxbla/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77807/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77807/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
