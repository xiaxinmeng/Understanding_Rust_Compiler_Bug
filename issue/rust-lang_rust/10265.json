After trying to change occurrences of the first form, I noticed rustc does not treat them equally. A minimal test shows this easily: \n\n```\n// world.rs\n#[link(name = \"world\", vers=\"1.0\")];\npub fn explore() -> &str { \"world\" }\n```\n\nThis is used by \n\n```\n// main.rs\nextern mod w(name = \"world\");\nfn main() {\n    println(\"hello \" + w::explore());\n}\n```\n\nAnd it all works if I compile world.rs as a lib and then compile main.rs passing -L . to rustc. If I change the first line in main.rs to extern mod w = \"world\", it does not work (\"can't find crate for 'w')\". \n\nWhile trying to find out if the two forms should be equivalent I looked at [view items in the manual](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/rust.html#view-items); by the specification there maybe the two forms are not meant to be equivalent, but I was informed on IRC that this is probably a rustc bug, so I'm filing it. \n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10265/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10265/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
