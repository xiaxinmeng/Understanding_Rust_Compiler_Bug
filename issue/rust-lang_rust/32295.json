In my case I get:\n\n```\nsrc/lib.rs:181:29: 181:38 error: unable to infer enough type information about `_`; type annotations or generic parameter binding required [E0282]\nsrc/lib.rs:181         let x_no_j = xdiffs.submatrix(&all_sample_diffs, &all_but_j);\n                                           ^~~~~~~~~\nsrc/lib.rs:181:29: 181:38 help: run `rustc --explain E0282` to see a detailed explanation\n```\n\nNot sure why, this information is given twice, which is pretty common in my experience. This is separate from the diagnostics issue mentioned above because the signature for submatrix is:\n`fn submatrix(self, rows: &Vec<Ix>, columns: &Vec<Ix>) -> MA` \n(fixed, had written without code escaping: fn submatrix(self, rows: &Vec<Ix>, columns: &Vec<Ix>) -> Self;)\n\nwhere Ix = usize. In other words, to my knowledge, there aren't any unbound type parameters...\n\nwhen trying to verify this by inserting a line, I get:\n\n```\nsrc/lib.rs:182:13: 182:15 error: mismatched types:\n expected `ndarray::ArrayBase<collections::vec::Vec<f64>, (usize, usize)>`,\n    found `()`\n(expected struct `ndarray::ArrayBase`,\n    found ()) [E0308]\nsrc/lib.rs:182         let () = xdiffs.submatrix(&all_sample_diffs, &all_but_j);\n                           ^~\n```\n\nwhich also does not show any unbounded type parameters.\n\nAny help welcome. Sorry the repo where I get this is private, I hope the above information helps. \n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/32295/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/32295/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
