GPIO pins.\r\n\r\nI've reproduced a small testcase of the problem here: https://git.cryto.net/joepie91/rustdoc-foreign-traits-bugcase\r\n\r\nThe generated documentation is included, but can also be found [here](http://cryto.net/~joepie91/rustdoc-bugcase/rustdoc_foreign_traits_bugcase/). You can see that the [`other::Foo`](http://cryto.net/~joepie91/rustdoc-bugcase/other/trait.Foo.html) trait has an `impl Foo for Baz` under implementations on foreign types, but conversely the [`Baz`](http://cryto.net/~joepie91/rustdoc-bugcase/third/struct.Baz.html) struct does *not* list the `Foo` trait anywhere.\r\n\r\nIdeally, this should work bidirectionally, and the `Foo` trait *should* be listed on `Baz` (eg. as a 'foreignly implemented trait').\r\n\r\n```\r\ncargo 1.31.0-nightly (2d0863f65 2018-10-20)\r\nrelease: 1.31.0\r\ncommit-hash: 2d0863f657e6f45159fc7412267eee3e659185e5\r\ncommit-date: 2018-10-20\r\n```", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55434/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55434/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
