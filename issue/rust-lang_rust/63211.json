That's... not right, though, obviously, since the right-hand side matches `Iterator<Item=u32>`, and the left side requires `Iterator<Item=i8>` -- so it should be _expecting_ `i8` and _finding_ `u32`. For a MCVE ([playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=release&edition=2018&gist=c7fcd748341aec3844ea64b3ff8628a1)):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait F {\r\n    type T;\r\n}\r\nstruct Fi<A>(A);\r\nimpl<A> F for Fi<A> {\r\n    type T = A;\r\n}\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let _: &dyn F<T=i8> = &Fi(1u32);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a relatively small bug, but it makes debugging extremely difficult when you don't know what's happening, and just see that it's expecting _exactly_ the type you're providing it.\r\n\r\nIt _does not_ occur with generics, or plain wrong types -- e.g. `let _: Fi<i8> = Fi(1u32);` and `let _: i8 = 1u32` both fail with correct error messages.\r\n\r\nI think this might be the same as #57226, but I wanted to bump the issue (since that one hasn't had any attention and I think this is important) as well as provide a somewhat clearer, more minimal example.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOccurs with rustc 1.38.0-nightly as well as beta and stable.", "closed_by": {"login": "estebank", "id": 1606434, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY0MzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1606434?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank", "html_url": "https://github.com/estebank", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63211/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63211/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
