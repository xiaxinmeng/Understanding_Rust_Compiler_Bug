This will get more and more important the more runtime moves into rust.\n\nBut the real problem of linked failure is the sendability requirement. Currently our lists and hashtables are written with @-boxes everywhere. We should have a @-version (for lazy-copy power and for cheapness of allocation) and a ~-version (for inter-task) for each data structure, and ways to convert between each.\n\nBut-once-more, ~ data structures will have complicated interfaces. You can't just hand back a ~-pointer to give the user a handle to a node, and disaster will ensue if you try iterating by handing around region pointers but also mutating the data structure at the same time. This hints at problems with mutability, too.\n\nIt seems like combining region pointers and mutability, we should be able to let the borrow-checker ensure this sort of property. `fn each` could be defined in `impl for foo_send/&`, and `fn remove` defined in `impl for foo_send/&mut`. This might require more powerful propagation of (im)mutability through ~, records, etc.\n\nFor future (my own) reference, a half-complete attempt at twiddle-ifying hashmap: https://gist.github.com/3057003\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2816/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2816/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
