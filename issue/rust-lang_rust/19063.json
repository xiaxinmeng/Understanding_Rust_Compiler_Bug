Ideally, they would also support dynamically-sized types, in a way such that `size_of_val(&[1, 2, 3]: &[int]) == size_of::<int>() * 3`. Because this requires an actual value, they wouldn\u2019t be able to simply defer to calling `size_of` etc. and would instead have to become intrinsic functions. I believe that this issue makes implementing pointer types that accept dynamically-sized type parameters very difficult (if not impossible) (e.g., #18248 (although I think that also might require a way of running destructors for unsized values)).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bluss", "id": 3209739, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDk3Mzk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3209739?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss", "html_url": "https://github.com/bluss", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19063/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19063/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
