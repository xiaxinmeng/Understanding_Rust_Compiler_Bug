But compiling it told me:\n\n```\nerror: the trait `core::fmt::String` is not implemented for the type `(_, _)`\n```\n\nI found this surprising, but then tried to implement this trait myself by writing:\n\n```\nextern crate core;\nuse core::fmt;\nimpl core::fmt::String for (i32,i32) { /* ... */ }\nfn main () {\n  println!(\"{}\", (1,2));\n}\n```\n\nCompiling this gave me the error:\n\n```\nerror: the type `(i32, i32)` does not reference any types defined in this crate; only traits defined in the current crate can be implemented for arbitrary types [E0117]\n```\n\nThanks to [some people on the Rust subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2sg60s/only_traits_defined_in_the_current_crate_can_be/), I now understand that this is essentially Haskell's \"orphan instance\" warning, but manifest as an error instead of a warning.\n\nI initially suggested that the problem here was this \"orphan instance\" policy, but I now think the problem is simply the one that the compiler originally told me: `core::fmt::String` is not implemented for the type `(_, _)`.\n\nIs there a technical reason that there is no `core::fmt::String` implementation for tuples? Because, coming from Haskell, I was expecting an equivalent of the `Show` instance for tuples. I think others, and not just people that have used Haskell, would expect to be able to print tuples without any fuss.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21189/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21189/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
