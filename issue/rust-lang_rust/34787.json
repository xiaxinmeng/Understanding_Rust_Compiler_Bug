Right now all we do this for is to reset the panic counter back to 0.\n\nThe purpose of this is to allow [code like this](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/34727#issuecomment-231511425) to work, but thinking more about that I believe that's actually undefined behavior on MSVC. Basically once a panic is initiated you can't initiate another panic for... \"reasons\". (I'm not 100% clear myself). This definitely seems like a sketchy pattern as well!\n\nSo if we _don't_ want to enable that pattern, I think we can get away with different management of the panic counter:\n- When a panic starts, bump the panic counter. If this indicates a double panic, abort.\n- When a `catch_unwind` returns from _catching a panic_, decrease the panic counter. (maybe assert it's 0?)\n\nThis way the normal usage of `catch_unwind` where nothing panics should never hit TLS, and we should still be able to use panics as we do today.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34787/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34787/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
