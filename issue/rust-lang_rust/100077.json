Logically, when the behavior is resolved and appropriate tests if any have been added, the issue can be closed, from Rust's perspective. Worse, leaving \"fixed but not ideally\" issues open makes it harder to sift through and prioritize problems. However, also logically, we also want to obtain various code improvements in the future, and not tracking them in some way makes it harder for us to find them again. Thus the purpose of this metabug is to allow observing these as a collective.\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43517 patched by https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47007\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/98768 patched by https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/98998\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100077/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100077/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
