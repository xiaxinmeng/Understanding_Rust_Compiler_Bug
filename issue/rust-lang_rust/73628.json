Pointer authentication may be worked around by [linking to an FFI function that runs ptrauth_strip](https://github.com/Crabapple-iOS/librustsupport/blob/master/library.m#L19-L22).\r\n\r\nThis may require LLVM changes if done, and quite possibly a new target (`arm64e-apple-ios`, `aarch64-apple-ios-armv83`, etc)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73628/reactions", "total_count": 20, "+1": 18, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 2}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73628/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
