For a quick PoC I've wrapped rustc to add `--cap-lints=forbid` before cargo's arguments and use `RUSTFLAGS=-Funsafe-code` to forbid unsafe code. No per-crate (or better) whitelist there.\r\n\r\nWhile trying to write some async code I noticed that `await!()` wasn't in `core` #56767, so I checked the sources to find it is in `std` but uses this scary attribute.\r\n\r\nI agree `#[allow_internal_unsafe]` should allow crates that forbid unsafe code to call the macro, but a crate with unsafe code forbidden shouldn't be able to use this attribute on its macros.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56768/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56768/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
