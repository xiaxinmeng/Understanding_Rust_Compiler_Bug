The `Drop` method of `Arc` gets to assume that `T` adheres to the stated bounds, but `Packet` is violating that promise.  (The current Rust implementation just blindly emits a `Drop` impl and invokes it; so presumably the invariants of `Arc` itself are maintained, but the global invariants of the system need not be.)\n\nWe have not been checking for this; such a check is the task described in #8142.\n\nBut we need to fix this; certainly as long as it is the case, the planned implementation of #8142 cannot land.\n\ncc @alexcrichton @aturon @nikomatsakis \n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/23584/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/23584/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
