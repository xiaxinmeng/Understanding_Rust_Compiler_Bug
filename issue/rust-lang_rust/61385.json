Similarly, if you right click on `v` in `let v = 31;`, there won't be any references listed. However, both are referenced one line below. Now, if you add `let w = Foo::Baz(v);`, then the `Baz` reference will be recorded for both `Foo` and `v`. So the problem is that enum struct variant constructor expressions aren't being considered for references.\r\n\r\nThisis no rls bug as the save-analysis by rustc is wrong. If you dump the save-analysis generated for the code above, you'll notice that the refs array is empty while it should contain entries for uses of `Foo` and the local `v` variable (as well as the `Bar` enum variant but that is a separate bug, it doesn't just affect struct variant constructors.
