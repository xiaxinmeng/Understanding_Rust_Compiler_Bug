There's a lot on it and it isn't obvious what's important. It's also missing some key community resources that basically all new users should read (rustbyexample.com and rustforrubyists.com).\n\nSome ideas:\n- Most of the crates we distribute are not that interesting, particularly for new users. How do we explain which ones they should pay attention to? Maybe some categorization would help.\n- rustbyexample.com and rustforrubyists.com are both too good not to direct people to, but they are both maintained externally and not distributed with our (versioned) documentation. How do we incorporate these?\n- This page doesn't explain how to get help, though it does link to the right places.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/14972/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/14972/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
