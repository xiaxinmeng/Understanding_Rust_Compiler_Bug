Even though the function explicitly allows rounding up to higher ticks, it would be nice to allow higher-precision timers.\r\n\r\nAfter a quick search I was able to find that the `SetWaitableTimer` function (used in [this](https://gist.github.com/Youka/4153f12cf2e17a77314c) gist) supports much higher precision timing, so, this is theoretically possible. I'm not particularly good at Windows programming, though, so, I shouldn't be doing this myself.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43376/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43376/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
