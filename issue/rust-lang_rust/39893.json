When run directly, it just prints out \"Segmentation fault\". Either case is not user friendly at all, and if you are using cargo, like most people do, then it is easy to mistakenly think that your program executed successfully. This actually happened to me in a larger program, and it took me a while to figure out what was really going on.\r\n\r\nWhen an allocation fails, there should be some sort of error message printed out. Ideally, it should point to the failing line of code, but even a generic \"out of memory\" message would be better than the status quo, which is nothing at all.\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "SimonSapin", "id": 291359, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTM1OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/291359?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin", "html_url": "https://github.com/SimonSapin", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39893/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39893/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
