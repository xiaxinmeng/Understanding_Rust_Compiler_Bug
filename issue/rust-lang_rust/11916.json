Not only are its patterns restricted to strings, but it also explicitly skips any non-utf8 filenames it encounters (which should at least be able to match a `*` pattern).\n\nTasks that need to be done:\n- [ ] `glob()` needs to accept both strings and byte-vectors. It can do this using `std::path::BytesContainer`\n- [ ] `glob()` needs to process its pattern as a byte vector instead of a string, which will allow it to process filenames as byte vectors. This includes matching non-utf8 filenames against `*` and `?` tokens (for the latter, matching a single byte is appropriate; ideally, it would match however many bytes are supposed to be consumed to create a `U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER` as per the unicode standard)\n\nThis is a sub-task of #9639.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "rust-highfive", "id": 7378925, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjczNzg5MjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7378925?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-highfive", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11916/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11916/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
