Windows-only types are no-where to be found.\n- Observation:  After running `cargo doc` and viewing local docs, any links to stdlib types are redirected to the rust-lang.org hosted docs, and so links to Windows-only types are `404 not found`\n\n**Problem:**  How to view the correct version of stdlib docs?\n\nFor example, reading the docs for [AsRawFd](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/os/unix/io/trait.AsRawFd.html) you see this:\n\n> This is only available on unix platforms and must be imported in order to call the method. Windows platforms have a corresponding `AsRawHandle` and `AsRawSocket` set of traits.\n\nBut if you try to search for `AsRawSocket`, there are no results, which is kinda frustrating.  \n\nSo my first thought was: how to remove the frustration of Unix-only docs on rust-lang.org?  I don't have a proposal for this yet.\n\nBut my second thought was this:  If rustup knows the path to the stdlib docs, could this path be passed to rustdoc, so that rustdoc can use local stdlib docs, instead of rust-lang.org docs?   This should be an optional mode, since a very common use case is to use rustdoc to generated docs to be hosted somewhere (like github pages), and in this case, linking to rust-lang.org docs would make more sense.\n\nWhat do you all think?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/35183/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/35183/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
