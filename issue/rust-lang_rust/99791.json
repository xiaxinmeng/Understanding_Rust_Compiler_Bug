Unless I misunderstand the `try` desugaring (likely), the error should at least be `<_ as Try>::Residual == Result<Infallible, &str>`?\r\n\r\nThe suggestion is perhaps fine, since it's (probably?) not possible to give a better suggestion, but if the suggestion is kept, at a minimum the follow-up error after applying the hint shouldn't lose information; ideally it should be possible to notice that this is a `try` block type ascription and provide a hint as to what the compiler _does_ know, and why it needs help.\r\n\r\nThe minimum amount of type information that I could get to compile is `let _: Result<_, &str> = try { Err(\"lol\")? };`.\r\n\r\nThis will likely get better \"for free\" if `try` is changed to be less general. (I recall a discussed possibility about requiring the `Residual` type to match, in order to make type inference work in more cases, of which I think this is one that's ideally supposed to work without further annotation.)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf the problem is not self-explanatory, please provide a rationale for the\r\nchange.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf dramatically different output is caused by small changes, consider also\r\nadding them here.\r\n\r\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\r\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions.
