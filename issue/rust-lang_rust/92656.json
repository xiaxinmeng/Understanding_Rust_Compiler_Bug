when you're looking at an overview.\r\n* It can be confusing to have to so many sections, and it creates more places where you have to look for what you want.\r\n* After the recent color reduction PR (#91480), the types are no longer colored differently, so it makes more sense to merge their sections.", "closed_by": {"login": "camelid", "id": 37223377, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjIzMzc3",
