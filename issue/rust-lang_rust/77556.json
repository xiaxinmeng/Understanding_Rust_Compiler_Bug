This time, it did most of them, but left the `src/llvm-project` submodule.\r\n\r\n`git submodule update` did fix src/llvm-project, but I try not to manually manage the submodules, for fear that it will interact poorly with x.py's automatic handling of it. So, this is some bug in the automatic handling of submodules, maybe.\r\n\r\nNote: This was my first update in quite a while, maybe 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nP.S.
