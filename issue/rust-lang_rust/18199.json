example should have checked these results, uncovering a bug, which is the file being opened in read-only mode when it was intended to be written to.\n\nIf warnings would fail the doc tests, this issue would have been caught automatically.\n\nIn case an example wants to explicitly allow \"questionable\" constructs, it can use the `allow(lint)` attribute.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton",
