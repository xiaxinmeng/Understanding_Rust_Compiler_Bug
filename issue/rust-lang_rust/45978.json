What this issue is about is that Rust currently doesn't recognize when a path has already been handled by a _Guard Clause_.\r\n\r\nI want to do the following:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::fs::File;\r\nlet file = File::open(\"program.cfg\");\r\n\r\nif file.is_err() { return Err(Error::ConfigLoadFail); }\r\nlet Ok(f) = file;\r\n```\r\n\r\n`let Ok(f) = file` is a nice usage of pattern matching.  But Rust complains as it doesn't know I've already accounted for the error path:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror[E0005]: refutable pattern in local binding: `Err(_)` not covered\r\n   --> src/lib.rs:166:7\r\n    |\r\n166 |   let Ok(f) = file;\r\n    |       ^^^^^ pattern `Err(_)` not covered\r\n\r\nerror: aborting due to previous error\r\n```\r\n\r\nI really look forward to using pattern matching with guard clauses rather than using `unwrap()` which I find a bit of an eye sore.\r\n\r\nI love Rust, keep up the good work ^_^", "closed_by": {"login": "Centril", "id": 855702, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTcwMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/855702?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril", "html_url": "https://github.com/Centril", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45978/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45978/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
