If it's not, I'd appreciate being directed to the right place.\n\nRustdoc has begun showing the version at which a function was introduced on some methods.  I'm not sure if this was introduced in 1.8.0 or if more methods were marked up, so I'm not sure how old this behavior actually is.\n\nUnfortunately, these headers are horrible for screen reader users (i.e. me) because of the order that screen readers read the elements.  Getting headings right is important because most screen reader users navigate by them.  When I want to see what's available, I just keep tapping next header and hey, \"fn foobar\".\n\nBy the behavior without version numbers and using [actual methods from the docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/vec_deque/struct.VecDeque.html), screen readers see:\n\n```\nfn is_empty(&self) -> bool [\u2212]\n```\n\nThis is good because I get the function name first.  I can simply keep going down the page very quickly, stopping at whatever looks interesting or whatever I'm looking for.\n\nBut by the new behavior:\n\n```\n1.6.0 [\u2212] fn drain<R>(&mut self, range: R) -> Drain<T> \n```\n\nThe most interesting piece of information is `fn drain`, but a screen reader user has to listen to (writing as text for illustration) \"one point six point zero left bracket minus right bracket\" first.  This is significantly longer than the actual interesting information.\n\nIf I had to estimate how much slower I go on pages that use these heavily, I'd have to say at least 2x.\n\nLooking at it in firebug, it appears that the difference is simply that the first header puts the code element in DOM order before the collapsing link, but the second header puts the since and collapsing link before the code.  Looking at it with the other tools in my toolbox, it appears the other headers do actually put the collapsing link first visually with CSS, but I am unsure if this is truly the case.  My tools for actually telling what CSS does are limited.\n\nI can't fix this myself because any change I might make has roughly a 50/50 chance of breaking the CSS and I obviously can't tell if I did or not.  If new CSS is needed (which I suspect) then I can't do anything.  There is a reason I avoid web programming.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33131/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33131/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
