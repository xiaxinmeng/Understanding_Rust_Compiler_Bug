Basically, the code ends up creating temporaries that refer to the arguments of `format!`, and those temporaries are dropped only at the end of the current scope, which is after `.await`. And so, those temporaries must live across a yield point, which in turn prevents the resulting generator from being `Send` with the error:\r\n```\r\nerror[E0277]: `*mut (dyn std::ops::Fn() + 'static)` cannot be shared between threads safely\r\n --> src/lib.rs:4:13\r\n  |\r\n4 | fn bar() -> impl Send {\r\n  |             ^^^^^^^^^ `*mut (dyn std::ops::Fn() + 'static)` cannot be shared between threads safely\r\n  |\r\n```\r\nThis pattern (I have found at least) is quite common, and so having the code rejected is unfortunate given that in these cases ew only need the returned `String` before the yield point.\r\n\r\n@Nemo157 proposed a fix in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/64477#issuecomment-534712712, which is implemented in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64856, but it changes the drop order of the argument to `format!`, which may have unintended consequences. In https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/64856#issuecomment-537080414, @nikomatsakis suggested that we may be able to solve this with changes to the analysis, which prompted the opening of this issue.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Centril", "id": 855702, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTcwMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/855702?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril", "html_url": "https://github.com/Centril", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/64960/reactions", "total_count": 15, "+1": 15, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/64960/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
