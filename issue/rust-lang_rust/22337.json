For instance, `Result`. Consider the following example:\n\n```\n#[derive(Debug)]\nstruct X;\n\nstruct Y;\n\nfn main() {\n    let x: Result<X, Y> = Ok(X);\n    println!(\"{:?}\", x);\n}\n```\n\nProduces the following error message:\n\n```\nissue.rs:8:22: 8:23 error: the trait `core::fmt::Debug` is not implemented for the type `core::result::Result<X, Y>` [E0277]\n```\n\nThis error message is confusing to someone beginning Rust, because according to the documentation, `Result` does implement `Debug`. In this case a clearer error message would be something like:\n\n```\nissue.rs:8:22: 8:23 error: the trait `core::fmt::Debug` is not implemented for the type `core::result::Result<X, Y>` because type `Y` does not implement `core::fmt::Debug`\n```\n\nPerhaps the error message could be tweaked, but in this case it should clearly point to `Y` as being the problem. Of course, if `X` and `Y` don't implement `core::fmt::Debug` the error message should reflect that was well.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "arielb1", "id": 1830974, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzA5NzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1830974?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1", "html_url": "https://github.com/arielb1", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22337/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22337/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
