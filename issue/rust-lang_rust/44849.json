The RFC specifies that we ought to treat a `FOO` binding that resolves to a constant as something which can skip through `&T` types -- however, that runs into trouble if the type of the constant itself is `&str` or `&[T]`. The current logic at least skips through all `&T` or `&mut T` types when it skips through *any*, but handling `&str` correctly would require skipping through \"only the right number\".\r\n\r\n@tschottdorf implemented various rules but we should at minimum update the RFC to match.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44849/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44849/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
