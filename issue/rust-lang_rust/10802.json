But anyways, here it is:\n\n``` rust\n#[feature(managed_boxes)];\n\nstruct DroppableStruct { a: int }\nimpl Drop for DroppableStruct {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        println!(\"Dropping\");\n    }\n}\n\ntrait MyTrait { }\nimpl MyTrait for DroppableStruct {}\n\n\nstruct Whatever<'a> { w: &'a MyTrait }\nimpl <'a> Whatever<'a> {\n    fn new<'b>(w: &'b MyTrait) -> Whatever<'b> {\n        Whatever { w: w }\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut f = DroppableStruct;\n    let _a = Whatever::new(@f as @MyTrait);\n}\n```\n\nThis doesn't run the destructor of `DroppableStruct`. This is pretty much as minimal as I could get the example, many changes make it work. E.g. changing the main function body to:\n\n``` rust\n    let f = DroppableStruct { a: 1 };\n    let b = @f as @MyTrait;\n    let _a = Whatever::new(b);\n```\n\nmakes the destructor work. Also, not saving the `Whatever` struct in a variable makes it work. Also, not saving the `@MyTrait` in `Whatever` makes it work. Good luck.\n\nUpdate: removed `mut`, was not relevant.\nUpdate2: added a field to the struct to show it's not an issue about zero-sized structs.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10802/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10802/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
