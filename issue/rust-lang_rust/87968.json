Where the inheritance logic of the universe is unavoidable. Everything is but fractals and entanglement borrows everything at once in solid parent-child inheritance chains.\r\nDuplicating code without inheriting on construction is like breaking the equal conservation of energy rule.\r\n\r\nThe whole reason a computer works is because it's a stateful object itself. If I walk to my other computer it is another object, they talk to each other. My other computer doesn't implement my file system, it talks via TCP and UDP messages. Responsibilities should be owned by the object as much as the device, Otherwise you're just looking at anarcho-communism and that has never been successful anywhere in the cosmos, particles and star systems all have a sense of object-oriented hierarchy, a gravity tree, particle-system if you will.\r\n\r\nThe idea that OOP and inheritance is wrong is to wish for chaos and delusionally believe that responsibility should be given to everything, that is mind-blowing, since no amount of human beings or amount of particles in this universe can fall into chaos without falling back into eventual order.\r\nRust may have worked conceptually, but if the entire computer was stateless, there would be no electrons in the machine.\r\nIf Rust cannot do what the universe does to keep perfect balance, and if it can't do any or all forms of basic existential logic, then it is Rust that is fallaciously imbalanced not the universe.\r\n\r\nI'm open to anyone to try to provide an argument on how I'm wrong in logos and pathos (but not ethos).", "closed_by": {"login": "nikic", "id": 216080, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjA4MA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216080?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87968/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87968/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
