It is a subissue of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/41517.\r\n\r\n## Current status\r\n\r\nOnce #55101 lands, many aspects of trait aliases will be implemented. However, some known limitations remain. These are mostly pre-existing limitations of the trait checker that we intend to lift more generally (see each case below for notes).\r\n\r\n**Well-formedness requirements.** We currently require the trait alias to be well-formed. So, for example, `trait Foo<T: Send> { } trait Bar<T> = Foo<T>` is an error. We intend to modify this behavior as part of implementing the implied bounds RFC (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44491). \r\n\r\n**Trait object associated types.** If you have `trait Foo = Iterator<Item =u32>`, you cannot use the trait object type `dyn Foo`. This is a duplicate of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24010.\r\n\r\n**Trait object equality.** If you have `trait Foo { }` and `trait Bar = Foo`, we do not currently consider `dyn Foo` and `dyn Bar` to be the same type.
