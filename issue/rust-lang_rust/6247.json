In my case, this prevented me from linking a valid Rust program against librustdoc because rustc was unable to find librustllvm.so.\n\nThe fix is a trivial change to mk/install.mk: add the following line to the rule for **install-target-$(1)-host-$(2): ...**, after the equivalent line for CFG_RUNTIME_$(1):\n\n```\n$$(Q)$$(call INSTALL_LIB,$$(TL$(1)$(2)),$$(PTL$(1)$(2)),$$(CFG_RUSTLLVM_$(1)))\n```\n\nOn 64-bit Linux, this will drop librustllvm.so in $prefix/lib/rustc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib along with everything else.\n\nHappy to provide a pull request, but this appears to be a one-liner.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6247/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6247/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
