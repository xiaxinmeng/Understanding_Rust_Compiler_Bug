It's perfectly acceptable to not cater to every miniscule style convention. Here is my proposal:\n1. Remove the direct attribute forms, since their unwieldiness was why we introduced the comment syntax in the first place. This reduces to four.\n2. Select **either** line or block, and remove the other. This reduces to two.\n3. Remove the inner form if possible. If we can find some special way to document modules without requiring a special syntax just for that, then so much the better.\n\nAlternatively, we could conclude that it's simply too much trouble to have special forms for doc comments and just stick with the attribute forms. This would be somewhat uglier, but more consistent with the rest of the language\n", "closed_by": {"login": "rust-highfive", "id": 7378925, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjczNzg5MjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7378925?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-highfive", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6782/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6782/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
