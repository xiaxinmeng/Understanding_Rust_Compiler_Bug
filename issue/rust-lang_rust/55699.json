Does anyone know if there's a script, ideally for every available rustup target, to automatically install the requisite things to get cross-compilation to work? I imagine MSVC would be rather difficult, as this usually requires a full Visual Studio installation in either a VM or wine or something.\r\n\r\nAny interest in promoting cross-compilation into the normal Rust tool set? I'm really jealous of Go's native cross-compilation in comparison, where the user doesn't need to muck around with any additional toolchains, linkers, config files, or headers. It Just Works^TM.\r\n\r\nFor one-off ports, it's almost worth going through the effort of setting up the right bits for `cargo build --target`... to do its thing. But I wouldn't want to spend that much time, per target, figuring out how to install my dev tools. I'm honestly defaulting to Go for most projects specifically for the cross-compilation support. For Rust, I am working around this limitation by [looping](https://github.com/mcandre/tonixxx/tree/master/examples/bronze) over Vagrant boxes to (semi-)rapidly port my Rust projects to an array of different targets.\r\n\r\nI also tried Docker containers, of course, as these would in theory be faster. But it takes too much work to setup cross-compilation toolchains in Linux that VM's seem to be the most efficient option for now :/", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55699/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55699/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
