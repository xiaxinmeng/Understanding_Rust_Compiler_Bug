Here is a checklist: \r\n\r\n- [x] Issue warnings at the right times; [this gist](https://gist.github.com/nikomatsakis/acdeb20b0192e2a1f404d514b3002c59) provides a comprehensive test case.\r\n  - \"Warning: never used at all\" falls under `unused_lifetimes`\r\n- [x] For each warning, issue a suggested fix:\r\n  - For a single-use lifetime `'a` appearing in `&'a T`, suggest `&T`\r\n  - For a single-use lifetime `'a` appearing in any other place, suggest `'_`\r\n  - One challenge: the binder must be removed too\r\n    - cc @estebank -- is it possible to give suggested fixes that make changes to multiple spots at once? I guess that might just be multiple suggestions?\r\n- [] We'll know this is *really* done when we can enable by default in rustc crates and apply rustfix with suggestions\r\n\r\n### Older Background\r\n\r\nThe idea is that an explicit name like `'a` should only be used (at least in a function or impl) to *link together* two things. Otherwise, you should just use `'_` to indicate that the lifetime is not linked to anything.\r\n\r\nUntil https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15872 is closed, we should only lint for single-use lifetime names that are bound in **functions**. Once #15872 is closed, we can also lint against those found in impl headers.\r\n\r\nWe can detect cases where a lint is valid by modifying [the `resolve_lifetimes` code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3cf28f3002470f61a471c69b869e4f55ae1766f7/src/librustc/middle/resolve_lifetime.rs):\r\n\r\n- This code basically walks over the HIR and resolves all lifetime names. \r\n- It maintains a stack of [scopes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3cf28f3002470f61a471c69b869e4f55ae1766f7/src/librustc/middle/resolve_lifetime.rs#L194-L230) indicating what names are valid.\r\n- [The function `with()`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3cf28f3002470f61a471c69b869e4f55ae1766f7/src/librustc/middle/resolve_lifetime.rs#L781-L803) is used to push new scopes on the stack. It is also given a closure which will execute with the new name bindings in scope.\r\n    - `with()` gets called for impls and other kinds of items [from here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3cf28f3002470f61a471c69b869e4f55ae1766f7/src/librustc/middle/resolve_lifetime.rs#L348-L351); for methods and functions in particular it is called from [`visit_early_late`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3cf28f3002470f61a471c69b869e4f55ae1766f7/src/librustc/middle/resolve_lifetime.rs#L823)).\r\n- Once a name is in scope, [`resolve_lifetime_ref()`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3cf28f3002470f61a471c69b869e4f55ae1766f7/src/librustc/middle/resolve_lifetime.rs#L866) is called to resolve an actual reference to a named lifetime.\r\n    - This could be used, for example, to update some information in the `Scope`, e.g. counting how many times a particular lifetime was referenced.\r\n- Then, before `with()` returns, we could scan the lifetimes and check for those that were only referenced 1 time (or 0 times...) and issue a lint warning.\r\n\r\n(There are some directions for how to add a lint under the header \"Issuing future compatibility warnings\" in [the rustc-bug-fix-procedure page on forge](https://forge.rust-lang.org/rustc-bug-fix-procedure.html) -- we can skip the \"future compatibility\" parts here.)\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44752/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44752/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
