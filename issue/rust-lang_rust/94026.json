It's very clear that `.write(&[a])` is not the same as `.write_u8(a)`, but not whether *the same sequence of bytes* to `write` is supposed to be the same thing, even if they're in different groupings, like `h.write(&[a, b]); h.write(&[c]);` vs `h.write(&[a]); h.write(&[b, c]);`.\r\n\r\nThis is important for the same kind of things as the `VecDeque` example mentioned on `hash_slice`.  If I have a circular byte buffer, is it legal for its `Hash` to just `.write` the two parts?  Or does it need to `write_u8` all the individual bytes since two circular buffers should compare equal regardless of where the split happens to be?\r\n\r\nGiven that [`Hash for str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.58.0/src/core/hash/mod.rs.html#696-702) and [`Hash for [T]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.58.0/src/core/hash/mod.rs.html#754-760) are doing prefix-freedom already, it feels to me like `write` should **not** be doing it again.\r\n\r\nAlso, our `SipHasher` implementation is going out of its way to maintain the \"different chunking of `write`s is fine\":\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/6bf3008f0757c7c89c3f02e0e7eaac5ee30c1c6c/library/core/src/hash/sip.rs#L264-L308\r\n\r\nSo it seems to me like this has been the expected behaviour the whole time.  And if not, we should optimize `SipHasher` to be faster.\r\n\r\ncc #80303 which lead to this text in `hash_slice`.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94026/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94026/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
