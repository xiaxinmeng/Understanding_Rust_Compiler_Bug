null, "body": "https://github.com/huonw/bad-error-messages-a contains a crate `a`. https://github.com/huonw/bad-error-messages-bc contains two crates, `b` and `c`.\n- `a` contains a trait `Foo` and a function `test` that requires that trait.\n- `b` depends on a specific revision (8b532f5, not the HEAD) of `a` and contains a type `Bar` that implements `a::Foo`.\n- `c` depends on `a`'s HEAD (happens to be 84cfe230) and `b`, and tries to use `b::Bar` with `a::test`.\n\n`c` fails to compile despite `Bar` \"clearly\" implementing `Foo`... it's even displayed in the docs!\n\nCloning https://github.com/huonw/bad-error-messages-bc and running `cargo build` in the root (which is `c`) gives\n\n```\n   Compiling a v0.0.1 (https://github.com/huonw/bad-error-messages-a#84cfe230)\n   Compiling a v0.0.1 (https://github.com/huonw/bad-error-messages-a?rev=8b532f5#8b532f51)\n   Compiling b v0.0.1 (file:///home/huon/projects/test-rust/error-messages/c)\n   Compiling c v0.0.1

     ^~~~~~~\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n```\n\nThere's no indication of the fundamental problem from either `rustdoc` or `rustc`: that there's two different versions of `a` being used, meaning `a#84cfe230::Foo` and `a#8b532f5::Foo` are different. `Bar` only implements the latter, but in `c`, the name `a` refers to `a#84cfe230` so `a::test(...)` requires the former. (Using `name#rev` to represent the crate with that version.)\n\nThere _is_ an indication of the difference in the example above, since `a` is compiled twice, but that comes from `cargo`, not `rustc`. This issue is focusing on the fact that `rustc` itself does not give helpful errors and/or allow tools like cargo to control those errors.\n\nIt would be nice if rustc:\n- disambiguated ambiguous names, probably by filepath/name by default\n- allowed cargo to specify semantically relevant info for the disambiguation e.g. pass in the version/revision/..., so that rustc can print `foo#0.2.3` instead of the filepath/name\n- detected errors that may be caused by ambiguous names and noted it explicitly, e.g. when there is a error involving an ambiguous crate print (once) some extra lines like `\"note: there's multiple versions of crate `...` in use\"`: along with a listing of the possibilities.\n\n(NB. I've used `cargo` to construct this example because it is the easiest way I can get two different versions of a crate. This appears in rust-lang/rust's makefiles too, where the `std` test runner is called \"std\" internally, but links against another crate called \"std\", i.e. the conventional standard library.)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22750/reactions", "total_count": 53, "+1": 49, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 4, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22750/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
