The font in places like \"The Book\" is absolutely fine.\r\n\r\nI'm sure I've seen this brought up in the issues before, but I don't seem to be able to find those issues anymore because I can't remember what I searched,  so I hope you don't mind me creating a new issue for this.\r\n\r\nCurrently the rust docs only really display all text in a serif style font, which is extremely difficult to read, especially when there are large sections of bold text.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may be a deliberate design decision, but unfortunately it makes it hard for people like me (no disabilities, just bad eyesight) to read anything. In my case I don't care about the design, I just want to be able to read the text without straining my eyes.\r\n\r\nIf the docs can't be changed to a sans-serif font by default, then could an option at least be provided to change the font to a sans-serif one instead?\r\n\r\nEven the default `font-family: sans-serif;` is fine. Anything but serif will do for me.\r\n\r\nCurrently when I open the docs I have to open the inspector in Chrome and apply `font-family: sans-serif;` to the entire site just to get anything done. This works but I shouldn't really have to do this in the first place.\r\n\r\nA serif font is fine for short pieces of text, like titles for example, but for the main body of text I hope a sans-serif font option can be seriously considered.\r\n\r\nI hope I'm not missing anything. If there's already an option to do this then please let me know.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52449/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52449/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
