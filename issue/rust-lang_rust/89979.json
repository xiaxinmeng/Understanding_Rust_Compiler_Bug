I don't think any errors should contain trailing whitespace in the first place though. If you search the codebase with regex `^   \\| $` you will find tons of such cases.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35064754/137623202-aa36ce7d-4e64-4fab-a56d-76fc6163b1d1.png)\r\n\r\nI have the slight feeling that whitespace might just originate from only a single location somewhere in the error printing code so perhaps this is an easy fix and thus probably worth fixing.\r\nA pattern I noticed is that the trailing whitespace pretty much always seems to come at the end of a `help:` suggestion.\r\n\r\nTo be fair there's far more whitespace though. If you put `src/**/*.stderr` in files to include and use `\\s$` as the regex, you will find even more.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/89979/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/89979/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
