Maybe @lambda could be so kind to comment on this.\r\n\r\nI can also create a Mockup, I just wanted to check first whether this is even an idea worth discussing.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97306/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97306/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
