These implementation oversights were long overlooked and thus became part of the stable Rust compiler.\r\n\r\nPR #57730 fixed those aforementioned implementation details, and thus some instances of `impl Trait` are rejected as erroneous when they were previously accepted by the stable compiler. Since our policy is to provide a smooth transition when such errors are introduced (see [RFC 1589][]), PR #58608 adapted those fixes to the implementation to downgrade those particular rejections of nested `impl Trait` to be linted as warnings rather than errors.\r\n\r\n[RFC 1589]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1589-rustc-bug-fix-procedure.md\r\n\r\n#### How to fix this warning/error\r\n\r\nAll cases where this code was known to successfully compile are instances of `impl Trait` in argument position (#44721). All such cases can be rewritten to instead use explicit generic type parameters. For example, this signature from #57979 \r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn collect(_: impl IntoIterator<Item = impl Borrow<Data<impl AsRef<[u8]>>>>)\r\n```\r\n\r\ncan be rewritten as follows:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn collect<T>(_: impl IntoIterator<Item = impl Borrow<Data<T>>>) where T: AsRef<[u8]>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Current status\r\n- [x] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/58608 introduces the `nested_impl_trait` lint as warn-by-default\r\n- [ ] PR ? makes the `nested_impl_trait` lint deny-by-default\r\n- [ ] PR ? makes the `nested_impl_trait` lint a hard error", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/59014/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/59014/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
