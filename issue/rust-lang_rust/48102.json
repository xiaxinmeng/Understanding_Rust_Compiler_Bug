Clone https://github.com/staktrace/cbindgen and check out the `rpath_bug` branch (the relevant change in this branch is that it sets `rpath = true` in the dev/release profiles in `Cargo.toml`.\r\n2. Run `cargo build`\r\n3. Run `target/debug/cbindgen`. Observe that it produces an error that it can't find the libproc_macro shared library\r\n4. `mkdir target/debug/subfolder && mv target/debug/cbindgen target/debug/subfolder/`\r\n5. Now run `target/debug/subfolder/cbindgen`. Observe that it runs without the error\r\n\r\nIf you run `readelf -d target/debug/cbindgen | grep RUNPATH` you'll see something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH)            Library runpath: [$ORIGIN/../../../../../.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib:/home/kats/zspace/cbindgen/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe important part here is that the path relative to $ORIGIN is wrong, there is one too many `../`. That's why moving the binary into a subfolder works while running it where it is does not. I'm not really sure why this is generated using a relative path anyway, IMO it should be absolute so that it works no matter where it's placed. It seems excessively brittle to make it relative (and based on this bug, I don't see how it's of any value to anybody right now).\r\n\r\nNote that I discovered this problem while attempting to find a workaround for #47931 which might provide more useful context.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48102/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48102/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
