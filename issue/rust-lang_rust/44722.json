This may be deemed a valid change but I feel like it deserves at least a short discussion for a number of reasons.\r\n\r\n* This is a breaking change for anyone that was relying on that target generating Arm code. e.g., anyone using inline assembly with Arm state only instructions or someone bit fiddling code pointers and maybe some other ways. However, I think it's unlikely someone was doing this.\r\n* There is a convention for the rust target names that generate Thumb code to start with `thumb` instead of `arm`. This is the same convention clang uses for `--target` and LLVM.\r\n\r\nEither way, the same change should probably be applied to all the `armv7*` targets for consistency.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44722/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44722/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
