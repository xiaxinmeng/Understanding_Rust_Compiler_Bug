Many of these chunks are identical (a lot of it is just air, for example), so it would make sense to reuse the a chunk in several places. When a new chunk is generated, the hash of the chunk is looked up in a collection to see if there is an already identical chunk and if there is, then use that one.\n\nIf `HashSet` had a `get` function then I could use a `HashSet<Arc<Chunk>>`, but since it does not, I instead have to use a `HashMap<Arc<Chunk>, Arc<Chunk>>` where the key and value is always the same which does not seem totally logical and downright impossible if it were a non-cloneable key.\n\nLikewise, it may be an idea to implement some sort of `get_key_value` that would return a key value pair for `HashMap`.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21234/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21234/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
