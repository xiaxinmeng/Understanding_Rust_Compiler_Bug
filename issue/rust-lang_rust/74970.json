However, the same snippet using `pub(crate) fn foo()` gives a warning:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nwarning: function is never used: `foo`\r\n --> src/main.rs:1:15\r\n  |\r\n1 | pub(crate) fn foo() {\r\n  |               ^^^\r\n  |\r\n  = note: `#[warn(dead_code)]` on by default\r\n\r\nwarning: 1 warning emitted\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that binaries can't be used in anything else (as far as I'm aware?), would it make sense to treat `pub` as equivalent to `pub(crate)` in binaries? I don't believe there is any difference in semantics, but it certainly makes a difference regarding warnings.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCC @estebank, who suggested I file an issue.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74970/reactions", "total_count": 15, "+1": 15, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74970/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
