Also just generally depending on broken or unsound features in rustc is probably not good :laughing: \r\n\r\nRecently stumbled on #107937 which attempts to enable `generic_const_expr` a (very) broken/incomplete feature.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell there's only one usage of `allow(incomplete_features)` and that's to enable `adt_const_params` which will likely be moved off of `incomplete_features` soonish", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108045/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 6, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108045/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
