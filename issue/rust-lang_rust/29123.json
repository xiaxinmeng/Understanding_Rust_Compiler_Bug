However, cargo doesn't seem to be building correctly. It looks like cargo 0.4.0 was bundled in with this release. Here is an image of the output:\n\n![cargoerrorannotated](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9166578/10560217/873e03f0-74b8-11e5-9a8c-847190fb9b1a.PNG)\n\nFirst, it appears that the \"print-file-names\" option was misspelled as \"print=file-names\".\n\nSecond, I tried to run the command separately, fixing the misprint, and it still doesn't work:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9166578/10560272/4853e288-74bb-11e5-8592-d78019b75b40.png)\n\nI tried omitting the print-file-names parameter, but it just hangs indefinitely.\n\nSo... any ideas? I'm trying to work on installing the most recent cargo nightly (0.6.0), but it's not as straightforward on windows as I would have hoped...\n\nI guess the main point here is that the version of cargo bundled with rust windows 1.3 doesn't seem to be working properly.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "hintron", "id": 9166578, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjkxNjY1Nzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9166578?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/hintron", "html_url": "https://github.com/hintron", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hintron/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hintron/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hintron/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hintron/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hintron/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hintron/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hintron/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hintron/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hintron/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29123/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29123/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
