This means you cannot have a `Pin<*const T>`, `Pin<*mut T>` or `Pin<NonNull<T>>`. We should consider extending the API of Pin to support these constructs.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't know if there's much this actually helps, because we have no unsafe equivalent of `Deref` as a trait abstraction. As a result, I think the only APIs that could apply to these pointers generically is:\r\n\r\n* `unsafe fn new_unchecked(p: P) -> Pin<P>`\r\n* `unsafe fn into_inner(self: Pin<P>) -> P`\r\n\r\nThis limits the utility of `Pin` on these pointers, since it basically guarantees nothing with this API.\r\n\r\nIf we had an `UnsafeAsRef` trait, we could support unsafe equivalents of `as_ref` and `as_mut`, allowing you to at least maintain the pinning invariant in your unsafe code. In other words, some sort of `UnsafeAsRef` and `UnsafeAsMut` traits would be necessary for this to actually be helpful. I'm not sure if those traits are worth adding.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54815/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54815/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
