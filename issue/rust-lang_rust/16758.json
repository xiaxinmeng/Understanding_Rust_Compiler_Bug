Therefore, it is currently not checked. A possible fix is to find the alignment by taking the size of the struct from its vtable and subtracting the size of the drop flag. However, since the plan is to remove the drop flag anyway (#5016), I have just left a FIXME and issue a warning when we skip the check.\n\ncc @pnkfelix\n", "closed_by": {"login": "arielb1", "id": 1830974, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzA5NzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1830974?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1", "html_url": "https://github.com/arielb1", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16758/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16758/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
