However, for types that wrap around other types, such as Tuple, Array, Slice, RawPtr, etc. I was not able to make it work at first try. See the discussion here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/92443#discussion_r776808181\r\n\r\nBasically we want these comments to have links to the respective primitive type's implementation, e.g.:\r\n\r\n``` rust\r\n/// [`&[u32]::fmt()`] [`(u32, u32)::eq()`]\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould link to\r\n- https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#impl-Eq\r\n- https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.tuple.html#impl-Debug-6\r\n\r\nNote that for the tuple, we ideally want to link to the implementation for the specified size of the tuple.\r\n\r\nNot sure if we also need to know whether the type inside the tuple actually has the necessary traits, e.g. in the case of `[(a, b)::fmt()]`, `a` and `b` should also have `Debug`. This is pretty complex and we might be able to get away without it.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/92536/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/92536/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
