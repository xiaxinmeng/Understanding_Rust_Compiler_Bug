This could show phases, and for long phases like type checking, this could even show the name of the function being checked.\n\nTo which I replied:\n\n+1. We can use control codes to update parts of the terminal without spewing output.\n\nI will think about how to integrate this with `--color` and the drawing characters.\nI'm imagining that rustc in whiz-bang fancy terminal mode would display progress on a single line, updated at each stage:\n\n```\n[/] Parsing\n[-] Expanding macros\n[\\] Resolving names\n[|] Checking types\n[/] Checking lifetimes\n[-] Checking\n[+] All checks passed; generating LLVM\n[+] All checks passed; optimizing\n[+] All checks passed; generating machine code\n[+] All checks passed; linking\n[+] Compilation successful (in 0m 18s)\nyour-prompt$\n```\n\nAnd just that last \"success\" message will remain in your terminal buffer.\n\nThe spinner has a constant speed in wall-clock terms.  Long-running parts of rustc will call `sess.update_spinner()` now and then to keep it going.\n\nAfter we pass the \"rest easy\" point, the spinner turns into a calming `+` and the first part of the message turns green.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24335/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24335/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
