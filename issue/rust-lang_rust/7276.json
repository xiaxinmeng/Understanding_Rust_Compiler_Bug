Take \"eternally\" with a grain of salt as I couldn't keep it running very long since it was paging out everything else in RAM and sending the computer to a virtual stop.\n\nIt may or may not be related to issue #3352, although that issue mentions a poor error message and not en eternal loop, so perhaps it merits opening a new issue. I also noticed #6143 referencing several other module-related issues (e.g. #3352) where this one might fit in.\n\nI'm using the master branch, commit b0e3ffd3805203420846296bc7d5a3c13dfd8b3a on OSX 10.8.3. I discussed the issue briefly with @cmr on IRC before creating the issue.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nContents of main.rs:\n\n```\n#[link(name = \"modtest\", vers = \"0.0.1\", author = \"whoever\")];\n#[crate_type = \"bin\"];\n#[warn(non_camel_case_types)];\n\nuse hello::*;\nmod hello;\n\npub fn hi_str() -> ~str {\n  ~\"Hi!\"\n}\n\nfn main() {\n  say_hello();\n}\n```\n\nContents of hello.rs:\n\n```\nmod main;\n\npub fn say_hello() {\n  io::println(main::hi_str());\n}\n```\n\nAnd then just: rustc main.rs\n\nExpected result:\nI'm not sure if this is allowed or not as I'm trying to understand what's possible with the module system, but it probably shouldn't loop eternally.\n\nActual result:\nEternal loop, never stops allocating memory.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7276/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7276/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
