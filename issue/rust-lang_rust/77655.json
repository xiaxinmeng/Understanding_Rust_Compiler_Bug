There seems to be bug where an expression with type `!` that is made into a \"statement\" by adding a `;` will behave like it has type `!` instead of `()`:\r\n\r\nThe following code typechecks correctly, even though the function body has type `()` and the return type is `u32`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn foo() -> u32 {\r\n    panic!();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you replace the body with `panic!(); ()` you correctly get a type error.\r\n\r\nNote that this is still sound, since the expression will never finish evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis happens in stable (1.46.0) as well as nightly 1.49.0-nightly (2020-10-05 a1dfd24).\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "ehuss", "id": 43198, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTk4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43198?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss", "html_url": "https://github.com/ehuss", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77655/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77655/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
