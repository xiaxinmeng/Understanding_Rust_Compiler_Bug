We don't have a direct way to mark such a macro as unstable though, since it ends up being exposed during the intermediate expansion of client code that invokes `panic!` (or `assert!`, etc).\n\nFurthermore, some very clever hacks that @huonw came up with (and some not so clever hacks from me) all failed to enforce the desired instability guarantee.\n- On my end, I tried to have the macro conditionally expand into a reference to an unstable constant when called from somewhere other that `panic!`.\n- huon's idea was an improvement on this: Pass in a reference to an unstable type as part of the input to to macro, and enforce that it be unstable by binding it to a constant with the ascribed type.   (Oh wait, maybe that last bit was what caused the resulting problem... described below)\n\nIn either case, making this yield instability required that `ensure_not_fmt_string_literal` _not_ carry the `#[allow_internal_unstable]` attribute.  But then removing that attribute caused its expansion into uses of format internals to fail.  (This should _not_ have been an issue, according to @huonw .)\n\nSo, at this point, I have decided to punt on solving this problem.  Thus this ticket, which says: Let's fix this.  Eventually.
