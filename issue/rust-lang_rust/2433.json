This leads to problems when a type implements both interfaces:\n\n```\niface A { fn foo() -> bool; }\niface B { fn foo() -> int; }\n\n// These compile without warnings\nfn aa<T:A B>(x: T) -> bool { x.foo() }\nfn bb<T:B A>(x: T) -> int { x.foo() }\n\n// These don't compile, due to type error\nfn ab<T:A B>(x: T) -> int { x.foo() }\nfn ba<T:B A>(x: T) -> bool { x.foo() }\n```\n\nIt appears that which method \"x.foo()\" resolves to depends upon what order the bounds on x's type are declared in. The compiler does catch this ambiguity when we use a specific type rather than quantifying:\n\n```\nimpl of A for int { fn foo() -> bool { self > 0 } }\nimpl of B for int { fn foo() -> int { self } }\n\nfn foo(x: int) -> bool { x.foo() }\n```\n\nThe above results in an \"error: multiple applicable methods in scope\". At the very least this same message should be produced in the first example for all functions (aa,ab,bb,ba).\n\nI would argue that defining two interfaces with same-named methods in the same scope should itself be an error, for the same reason that defining two same-named functions in the same scope is an error: it produces inevitable and irresolvable ambiguity.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "rntz", "id": 16143, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16143?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rntz", "html_url": "https://github.com/rntz", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rntz/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rntz/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rntz/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rntz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rntz/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rntz/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rntz/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rntz/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rntz/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2433/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2433/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
