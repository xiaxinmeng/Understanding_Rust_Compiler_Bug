For Rust, `librustc_driver-*.so` and other shared libraries needed for `rustc` to run are installed to `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` on x86_64. And `rustlib` directory is installed as `/usr/lib/rustlib`.\r\n\r\nDuring Rust build, Debian just lets `x.py` install the shared libraries to `/usr/lib`, and then manually moves them to `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`.\r\n\r\nThis works before 1.67.\r\n\r\nBut since 1.67, `rustc` will fail to find `std` crate, since `rustc` tries to find `rustlib` directory through a relative path based on `librustc_driver-*.so`. `rustc` guesses `rustlib` directory is   `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/../lib/rustlib` aka `/usr/lib/lib/rustlib`, which does not exist.\r\n\r\nTo work around this, Ubuntu deploys a downstream [patch](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rustc/tree/debian/patches/ubuntu-fix-sysroot-detection.patch?h=applied/ubuntu/lunar-devel&id=7cc6b62b69c95351eaec5c89088853aeec52d39d). But as [discussed](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/failed-to-build-rust-1-68-2-for-freedesktop-sdk-std-library-not-found/91964/8) with @bjorn3, that patch actually breaks what Rust 1.67 trying to get.\r\n\r\nI hope Rust upstream can provide a better solution for this installation schema to work without downstream patch.\r\n\r\n### Version it worked on\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nProvide the most recent version this worked on, for example:\r\n\r\nIt most recently worked on: Rust 1.47\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt most recently worked on: Rust 1.66.1\r\n\r\n### Version with regression\r\n\r\n1.67\r\n\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/109994/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/109994/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
