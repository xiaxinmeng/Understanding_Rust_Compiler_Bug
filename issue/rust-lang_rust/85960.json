These both show up in the page for `struct My`, which is fine, I guess, and the links to the two methods are respectively `struct.My.html#method.foo` and `struct.My.html#method.foo-1`, so the URL scheme has difficulty with differentiating them. But I don't think intra-doc links have any analogous way to disambiguate these kinds of methods, and the substitution syntax `My<A>::foo` doesn't seem to work (it assumes that `A` is a type variable, not a struct).\r\n\r\nThis is similar to issues #74563 and #62834, and the (incorrectly closed) #54172 is about the version of this issue for trait impls, but here it's just inherent methods for different substitutions and/or type aliases. (I would like to use the type alias in the doc link, but really any way to refer to both items in the presence of this kind of ambiguity would be great.)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85960/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85960/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
