"Feature gate: `#![feature(io_read_to_string)]`\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for the `std::io::read_to_string` function.\r\n\r\nThe equivalent of `std::fs::read_to_string`, but generalized to all\r\n`Read` impls.\r\n\r\nAs the documentation on `std::io::read_to_string` says, the advantage of\r\nthis function is that it means you don't have to create a variable first\r\nand it provides more type safety since you can only get the buffer out\r\nif there were no errors. If you use `Read::read_to_string`, you have to\r\nremember to check whether the read succeeded because otherwise your\r\nbuffer will be empty.\r\n\r\nIt's friendlier to newcomers and better in most cases to use an explicit\r\nreturn value instead of an out parameter.\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor most library features, it'd be useful to include a summarized version of the public API.\r\n(E.g. just the public function signatures without their doc comments or implementation.)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn read_to_string<R: Read>(reader: R) -> Result<String>;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn the simplest case, this is a PR implementing the feature followed by a PR\r\nthat stabilises the feature. However it's not uncommon for the feature to be\r\nchanged before stabilization. For larger features, the implementation could be\r\nsplit up in multiple steps.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation: #80217\r\n- [x] FCP\r\n- [x] Stabilization PR (#100337)\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Function signature (#92863)\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80218/reactions", "total_count": 19, "+1": 15, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 2, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80218/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
