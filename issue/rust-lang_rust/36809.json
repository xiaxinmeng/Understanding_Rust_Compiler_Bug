I'd like to \ndiscuss a few things before I start implementing something.\n### Requirements\n\nI imagine the basic functionality of the testing infrastructure somewhat like\nthis:\n- There is a curated list of Rust codebases available as git repositories\n- There is a tool that will regularly probe those codebase for new commits\n- The tool will walk the history of a given branch of each project, compiling in\n  regular and in incremental mode at each step and checking that the result is\n  the same \n  (see [cargo-incremental](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/cargo-incremental)).\n- When there is something wrong, it should post some kind of notification \n  somewhere, containing enough information to reproduce the problem.\n- It will re-run whenever there is a new nightly version of the compiler\n- The tool should run on as many platforms as possible but at least the tier 1 \n  platforms.\n### Questions\n\nI'm looking for input from people already dealing with our automation and\nexperience with this kind of thing. \nSpecifically I'd be interested in the following questions:\n- Do we have (virtual) machines that could host this and that prospective \n  maintainers have access to?\n- Could some of this be hosted on travis-ci or similar services?\n- Is there something in this plan that sounds like a bad idea?\n- Is there some better way of achieving the given goals?\n\ncc @rust-lang/tools @edunham @nikomatsakis \n", "closed_by": {"login": "michaelwoerister", "id": 1825894, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjU4OTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1825894?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister", "html_url": "https://github.com/michaelwoerister", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36809/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36809/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
