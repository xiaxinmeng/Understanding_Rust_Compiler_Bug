It is shifted rightwards to make room for a \u00a7 that appears onhover. We use the \u00a7 as a click target to generate a URL fragment pointing at that specific item.\r\n\r\nThe former, `as_bytes`, doesn't have the extra whitespace and doesn't have a `\u00a7` onhover. Instead, the function name serves as the click target to generate a URL fragment. The function name on `add` can't serve that function because clicking it takes you to the [definition of `add` on the `Add` trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ops/trait.Add.html#tymethod.add).\r\n\r\nThe distinction here between some items having a \u00a7 and some not having it is potentially confusing (and complicates the rustdoc CSS). I think we should consolidate on every item having a \u00a7, whether its name links to a URL fragment or to another document.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86384/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86384/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
