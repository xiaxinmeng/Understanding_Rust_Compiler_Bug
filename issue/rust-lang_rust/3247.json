The quick fix is to patch that code, perhaps the better fix is to have a distinct self-id per method? Not sure.  It seems wrong to be baking in \"if this is self, do something special\" all over the place.\n\n@msullivan you may have an opinion.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "msullivan", "id": 340349, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDM0OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340349?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan", "html_url": "https://github.com/msullivan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3247/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3247/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
