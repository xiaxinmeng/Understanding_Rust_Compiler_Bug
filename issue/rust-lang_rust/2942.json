The code looked like this:\n\n```\nfn bar(+v: ~[int], i: uint) -> int { v[i] }\n\nfn foo(v: ~[int]) -> fn@(uint) -> int {\n    ret |i| {\n        bar(copy v, i)\n    }   \n}\n\nfn main() { #error[\"%d\", foo(~[5])(0)]; }\n```\n\nThe solution was to write `copy v` in the capture clause.\n\nPerhaps the warning message could be more informative? Could it hint that the copy comes from building the heap closure, and suggest writing a capture clause?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bblum", "id": 1820515, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjA1MTU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1820515?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum", "html_url": "https://github.com/bblum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2942/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2942/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
