This is similar for returned complex values - which is the catch, as tuples in rust are defined to have the same alignment behavior as records (cf spec). This means a (f32, f32) complex might suffer padding and is thus not suitable for implementing complex values.  I see different ways to deal with this and would like comments on which is best\n1. Implement native complex types (complex, c32, c64) in rust.  Shouldn't be too hard but is a substantial language change,\n2. Define tuple components to be stored consecutively (i.e. without padding/alignment),\n3. Solve via annotation when declaration function prototypes in native mods,\n4. Natively support c_vec (stack and heap allocated), or\n5. Implement tuple-based wrappers in the runtime.\n\nI'm tending to favor (1) though (3) and (4) might be desirable to have for other reasons.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1284/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1284/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
