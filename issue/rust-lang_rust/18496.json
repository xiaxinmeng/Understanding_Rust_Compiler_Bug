Coq programs can be extracted as [Haskell, OCaml, or Scheme](https://coq.inria.fr/refman/Reference-Manual025.html).  Because of pattern matching and other functional features, Rust is a more attractive target for extraction than most other systems languages.\n\nAnother application is to write the unsafe part of a Rust program in Coq, with a safety proof.  You can decide what safety properties to provide, within a model that can vary from the Rust machine model.  This is a lot more flexible (and a lot more work!) than the all-or-nothing nature of `unsafe`.\n\nBecause all three existing target languages use garbage collection, the extracted Rust code may need to rely heavily on reference counting.  However this is perfectly reasonable when extracting functional persistent data structures, which inevitably have non-unique ownership.\n\nIt would also be neat to embed affine types into Coq although I'm not sure what has been done or can be done here.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18496/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18496/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
