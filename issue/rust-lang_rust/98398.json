It may need adjusting to be more flexible for more complex options.\r\n\r\n### Implementation history\r\n\r\n- #67074\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/98398/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/98398/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
