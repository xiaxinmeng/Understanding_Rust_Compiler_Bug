For example:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl<T: UnsafeDefault> Default for T {\r\n    fn default() -> T {\r\n        unsafe {\r\n            use core::mem::uninitialized;\r\n            let mut t = uninitialized();\r\n            Self::unsafe_default(&mut t);\r\n            t\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've found `UnsafeDefault` to be a very useful primitive to have in implementing allocators - both for ergonomics and for performance. I think adding it to `core` and `std` could be very useful - especially as we try to clean up the story around custom allocators (which, in my experience, can benefit from using `UnsafeDefault` in their public APIs).", "closed_by": {"login": "joshlf", "id": 1046063, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDYwNjM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1046063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf", "html_url": "https://github.com/joshlf", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42441/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 1, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42441/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
