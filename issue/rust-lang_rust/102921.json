Typically this is a PR\r\nimplementing a feature, followed by a PR that stabilises the feature. However\r\nfor larger features an implementation could be broken up into multiple PRs.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implement the feature\r\n- [ ] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][doc-guide])\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][stabilization-guide])\r\n\r\n[stabilization-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr\r\n[doc-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#documentation-prs\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Do we want to stabilize this at all? That will be know after the unstable option sees some use.\r\n\r\n### Implementation history\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a list of all the PRs that were involved in implementing the feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/102963", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/102921/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/102921/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
