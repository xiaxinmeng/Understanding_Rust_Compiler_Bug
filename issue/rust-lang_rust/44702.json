However, this method does not yet support retrieving the fingerprints of `DepKind::MetaData` dep-nodes. As opposed to the fingerprints for other kinds of dep-nodes, these are not computed during the current compilation session; they are rather already computed during the previous compilation session and stored in the `metadata.bin` file in the exporting crate's incr.comp. session directory.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this loading of these hashes from `metadata.bin` happens in `rustc_incremental::persist::hash::HashContext`. To resolve this issue and gain copious amounts of \u2764\ufe0fs and \ud83c\udf89s, move this loading logic to `DepGraph::fingerprint_of()`.\r\n\r\nThe loading should still happen as semi-lazily as it does now (although doing it more lazily via memory mapped files should be implemented at some point in the future) and for that the `DepGraph` will need to have access to the incr.comp. session directory. It would still be preferable if the `DepGraph` did not keep a permanent reference to the whole `Session`, I think.\r\n\r\nThere's some preliminary work for this task already done in https://github.com/michaelwoerister/rust/tree/metadata-hashes-in-dep-graph (note: this branch is based on top of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/44696 and only the latest commit adds something new to that).\r\n\r\ncc @alexcrichton @nikomatsakis ", "closed_by": {"login": "michaelwoerister", "id": 1825894, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjU4OTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1825894?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister", "html_url": "https://github.com/michaelwoerister", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44702/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44702/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
