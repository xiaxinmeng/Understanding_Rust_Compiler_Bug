But if this really is a common pitfall, it'd better for Rust to have a specific diagnostic for this problem.\r\n\r\nThe last two warnings, in combination with the other binding `y` already in scope, strongly suggest that the programmer has made this exact mental mistake. The third warning in particular shows that the programmer expected the pattern `y` to be refutable.\r\n\r\nThe new warning could be something like: \"the identifier `y` in this pattern introduces a new variable (it does not refer to the variable `y` declared *here*)\"\r\n\r\n(Of course shadowing an existing binding is normal in other circumstances; I'm only proposing a different warning for certain situations where Rust already emits warnings.)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40476/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40476/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
