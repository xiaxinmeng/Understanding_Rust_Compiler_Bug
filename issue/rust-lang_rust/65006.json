However, this analysis overlooked the fact that a shared reference to a `Freeze` field of a struct could be converted to a shared reference to a `!Freeze` field of that same struct by offsetting a pointer.\r\n\r\nThis does not currently cause any unsoundness in the language, since this analysis is only used in const contexts, where the required operations are forbidden. However, we need to fix this before it becomes possible to take a mutable reference or mutate an `UnsafeCell` or other `!Freeze` type in a const context.\r\n\r\n#64980 [added a test](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/ui/mir-dataflow/indirect-mutation-offset.rs) that demonstrates the incorrect behavior.", "closed_by": {"login": "ecstatic-morse", "id": 29463364, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDYzMzY0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29463364?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse", "html_url": "https://github.com/ecstatic-morse", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/65006/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/65006/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
