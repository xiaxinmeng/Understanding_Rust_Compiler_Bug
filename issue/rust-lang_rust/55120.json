(I see this is an option `--print=native-static-libs` in the latest nightly (`nightly-2018-10-10`) and unreleased 1.22.0.)\r\n\r\nThe change was only visible to us upon linking to an Elixir app as a NIF during a two stage build process where on the second stage this particular library was absent. The error we see is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError loading shared library libgcc_s.so.1: No such file or directory (needed by /app/lib/elixir_package-0.0.1/priv/elixir_package_extension.so)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell [this commit](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c9645678e86861f670ce8b422c2e565c1a232916) and its parent PR (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/40113) seem related to this issue. According to the commit and PR the `libgcc_s` link requirement gets added for the musl target/to support dynamically-linked musl targets.\r\n\r\nHowever, we see this requirement listed on the latest nightly for the gnu and freebsd targets as well.\r\n\r\nWas this libgcc_s link requirement intended for the gnu and freebsd targets as well? Or was this an unintended change?\r\n\r\n## Reproducible example project\r\n\r\nTo track the issue down I created an example project with a reproducible state. It allows building an example Rust staticlib for musl and link it to Elixir as a NIF. Instructions can be found in the README. I'm adding this to add context and show a scenario to show how this requirement breaks between versions.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tombruijn/rust-elixir-linking-issue-example-project", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55120/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55120/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
