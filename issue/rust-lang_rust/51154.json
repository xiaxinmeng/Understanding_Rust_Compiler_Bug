I specified, that I want a box of F, but I create a closure. Because F is generic, it is caller-chosen and I create a new closure, which has a different type.\r\n\r\nStill, it took me quite some time to find out what was going on in the more complicated real code. I think that it would help to add a note here explaining, that each closure has a different type, and that the inner closure does not match the type F exactly. Maybe additionally a hint could be added, stating to use `Box<FnMut()>` instead (i.e. the traits F is bound to).", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51154/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51154/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
