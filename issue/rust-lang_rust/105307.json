Therefore, I come to post an issue here.\r\n\r\nFor the documentation generated for a type, it seems great to me if the trait implmentations can be grouped by the name of source crate (even source module) in the left navigation panel. Usually, a type won't have too many methods but it can have numerous trait implmentations (especially for numberic related types such as [BigUint](https://docs.rs/num-bigint/0.4.3/num_bigint/struct.BigUint.html) and [rug::Integer](https://docs.rs/rug/1.17.0/rug/struct.Integer.html)).\r\n\r\nPeople usually don't browse the trait implementations by the alphabetic order, they do directly by searching. But sometimes if I don't know which trait I'm looking for, but just want to know what functionalities the type support, it will be great if I can find the implementations by the crate / module name. For example, the implementation of all the arithmetic traits (Add, Sub, etc) can be grouped by the `core::ops` module name.\r\n\r\n# Current behavior\r\n\r\n(This documentation comes from [`dashu-int::UBig`](https://docs.rs/dashu-int/latest/dashu_int/struct.UBig.html))\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9154441/205682469-59f63b65-e475-4d09-8c1d-acef27457a03.png)\r\n\r\n# Proposed behavior\r\n\r\nThe style for the module names is to be defined.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9154441/205685172-c6fd0311-be1f-4931-aeea-9becf2ccf80b.png)\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/105307/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/105307/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
