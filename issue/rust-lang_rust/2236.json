The purpose of that commit was to fix up a bug in the way operator [] works on strings. In particular it used to let you index up to _and including_ the trailing null; now it considers access to the null byte an index overrun and fails.\n\nI tried to figure out exactly what was going on in the rope code for quite a while, and tried adjusting a number of obvious-looking things, but to no avail. I'm not really good with boundary-case arithmetic (are any of us?) and the rope module is a maze of such arithmetic.\n\nSharper minds requested to find the bug. Meanwhile I marked the rope test in question (`char_at1`) as ignored. The others seem to work.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2236/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2236/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
