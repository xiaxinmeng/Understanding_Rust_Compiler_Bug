One specific way to do this is to fuzz against different versions of crates from crates.io. This corresponds to a very particular, and common, workflow:\n- `cargo update` to get new packages\n- `cargo build` to build with them\n\nThe idea here would be to write a tool which iterates over the last N published crates (that is, the last N versions that have been published to crates.io). For each version V that has been published, we would:\n- Create a fresh directory\n- Load version V-1 (that is, the previous version available on crates.io)\n  - if there is no previous version, skip this crate\n- Compile version V-1 using `-Z incremental=some-temporary-directory`\n- Load version V in place (overwriting the old files)\n- Compile version V using `-Z incremental=some-temporary-directory`\n- Create another directory\n- Compile version V from scratch\n- Compare the results of the two compilations of version V:\n  - they should produce the same errors/warnings\n  - if successful, they should produce the same output file\n    - or at least it should contain the same symbols etc\n    - we'll have to work this out a bit =)\n\nAs of this writing, we're not yet at the point where incremental compilation actually _works_, but we are already tracking dependencies throughout the front-end; just tracking those dependencies sometimes causes ICEs, which means this tool would be of immediate use. Plus, we expect to be tracking dependencies soon. \n\nI imagine that this tool would be written in Rust. Rather than placing it in `src/test/tools`, it might be better if it lived as its own crate (maybe in `rust-lang`?), so that it can draw on the full crates.io ecosystem for utility functions and so forth. We would eventually just run it on a regular and continous basis and open issues for any problems that we find.\n\nSince it has relatively few prerequisites, this bug seems like a good \"entry vector\" for contributing to Rust. I would love to \"mentor\" someone to work on it.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33454/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33454/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
