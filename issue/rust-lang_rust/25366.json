What is the reason of this? Is this a bug or a feature? If I want to ensure that a given path exists I can't just call create_dir_all and be done with it. Instead I have to iterate over the pieces and create them separately.\n\nThe documentation states that \n\n> The specific error conditions for when a directory is being created (after it is determined to not exist) are outlined by fs::create_dir.\n\nbut the check whether it exists is not in the code (as far as I can tell). Did I misunderstand the code or the documentation or is this a bug?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "elszben", "id": 4603999, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDM5OTk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4603999?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/elszben", "html_url": "https://github.com/elszben", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elszben/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elszben/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elszben/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elszben/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elszben/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elszben/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elszben/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elszben/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elszben/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25366/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25366/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
