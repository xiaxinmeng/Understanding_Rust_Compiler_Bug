E.g. `ScopedJoinHandle::is_running` is part of `scoped_threads`, but also of `thread_is_running`. In these cases we now just apply only one of the `#[unstable]` attributes, and because of that sometimes accidentally stabilize something when only one of the features gets stabilized.\n\nIt'd be great if we could add multiple `#[unstable]` attributes to a single item. Allowing multiple `#[stable]` tags isn't a necessity. We could just remove the `#[unstable]` tag if the feature gets stabilized and there are other `#[unstable]` tags left. The most important part is that we don't forget about the other unstable tags and don't stabilize something by accident.\n\nAnother option would be multiple `feature =` arguments to `#[unstable]`.\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"compiler-errors\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94770/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94770/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
