It does so by analyzing the MIR of every function, following calls, references, drops, etc. \nIn theory this is a sound strategy.\n\nHowever, in combination with legacy-trans, which is not based on MIR, we are running into problems: Since the MIR is heavily optimized before being passed into the collector, it might not contain references to what really is dead code. HIR-based trans, however, does not have this knowledge and will have to translate everything. This leads to situations where HIR-based trans will insert references to what only MIR-based analysis knows to be dead code. Thus we end up with \"dangling references\" and, subsequently, linker errors.\n\nIn order to still support HIR-based trans for the time being, there's some code in trans that will instantiate functions and drop-glue on demand if the collector \"missed\" it. This code should be removed once HIR-based trans has been removed from the compiler.\nSpecifically, this concerns `trans::monomorphize::monomorphic_fn()` and `trans::glue::get_drop_glue_core()`.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "michaelwoerister", "id": 1825894, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjU4OTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1825894?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister", "html_url": "https://github.com/michaelwoerister", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34151/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34151/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
