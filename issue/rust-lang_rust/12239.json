This is because the `borrow()` ends after the _enclosing statement_ which in this case is `let foo_addr = &foo;`\n\nIn order to allow debugging these values, we should change the ast expansion to:\n\n``` rust\nstatic PRECOMPILED_FORMAT_STRING = ...;\nmatch foo {\n    ref foo_addr => {\n        let arguments: &fmt::Arguments = unsafe { /* do things with foo_addr */ };\n        fmt::writeln(logger, arguments)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote that with a `match` the enclosing statement encompasses the entire formatting call, so debugging `foo.borrow().get()` should be valid. One other portion of this bug would be ensuring that codegen doesn't suffer in terms of compile-time or size as a result of this change. It is currently unknown how much a `match` scope would affect codegen.\n\ncc @nikomatsakis \n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12239/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12239/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
