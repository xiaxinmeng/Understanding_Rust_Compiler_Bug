However, this is the natural way to deal with token trees, and adding a delimiter of some kind is prohibitively unergonomic.\n\nAs a short-term fix, we could special-case `tt` so that the macro parser doesn't farm it out to the main Rust parser. We could also introduce a `ttseq` or something to mean \"zero or more `tt`s\". It's conceivable that we could also try being smarter with lookahead, but I don't think that's going to be fruitful.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "kmcallister", "id": 444997, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDk5Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/444997?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister", "html_url": "https://github.com/kmcallister", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9364/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9364/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
