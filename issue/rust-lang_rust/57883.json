We do not allow transitive coercions. Example:\r\n```rust\r\nstatic A: fn() = || {}; // OK\r\nstatic B: unsafe fn() = A; // OK\r\nstatic C: unsafe fn() = || {}; // ERROR; would require the two coercions above transitively.\r\n```\r\nThis behavior of current Rust was unexpected in https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2592#discussion_r250462675.\r\n\r\n@cramertj had the idea to implement an immediately attainable direct coercion between closures and `unsafe fn` pointers rather than go the more complex and contentious route of transitive coercions (which may have unforeseen consequences).
