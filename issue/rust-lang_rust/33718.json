In the Variable Bindings section's Patterns subsection it says:\n\n> This means we can do things like:\n> let (x, y) = (1, 2);\n> After this expression is evaluated, x will be one, and y will be two.\n\nThis is confusing! I think the second sentence should be:\n\n> After this expression is evaluated, x will be 1, and y will be 2.\n\nThe same problem occurs in the following Type Annotations subsection which says:\n\n> let x: i32 = 5;\n> If I asked you to read this out loud to the rest of the class, you\u2019d say \u201cx is a binding with the type i32 and the value five.\u201d\n\nAgain, I think spelling the numbers is confusing and the sentence should be:\n\n> If I asked you to read this out loud to the rest of the class, you\u2019d say \u201cx is a binding with the type i32 and the value 5.\u201d\n\nThere may be more occurrences, but if so I won't report them on the assumption that you'll either change none of them if you disagree with me or change them all.\n\nI know that publishers recommend spelling out low numbers, but IMO this is not a good idea in a computer textbook where clarity is more important than purity.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33718/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33718/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
