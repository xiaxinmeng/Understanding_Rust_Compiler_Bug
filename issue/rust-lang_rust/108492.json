I'm opening issue here, but feel free to close if this should be reported to reference instead.\r\n\r\nThe question is: what is slice?\r\nAnswer 1: \"Slice is [T]\"\r\nAnswer 2: \"Slice is &[T] or &mut [T]\"\r\n\r\nReference says:\r\n> A slice is a [dynamically sized type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/dynamically-sized-types.html) representing a 'view' into a sequence of elements of type T. The slice type is written as [T].\r\n\r\nDefinitely, this means answer 1 is the right one.\r\n\r\nHowever, slice type documentation says:\r\n> A dynamically-sized view into a contiguous sequence, [T]\r\n\r\nWell, my English understanding is not good enough to tell what is `[T]` here: a \"contigous sequence\" itself or a view into one.\r\nSo I continue reading:\r\n\r\n> Slices are either mutable or shared. The shared slice type is &[T], while the mutable slice type is &mut [T] ... As slices store the length of the sequence they refer to, they have twice the size of pointers to [Sized](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/marker/trait.Sized.html) types\r\n\r\nBut this clearly suggests that correct answer to original question is answer 2!\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I can see three quotes related to the question. Quotes 1 and 3 look like contradicting, and second is maybe a bit complex to understand.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108492/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108492/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
