When I encountered the concept of `Primitive Types`, which is maybe the first concept to me, I was caught into trouble. All these referrences about this concept are lack of consistency.\n[1] `primitives types` comprises \"Booleans, char, Numeric types, Arrays, Slices, Tuples, Functions\";\n[2] \n\n> The primitive types are the following:\n> - The boolean type bool with values true and false.\n> - The machine types (integer and floating-point).\n> - The machine-dependent integer types.\n\n[3] add the `unit type ()` in comparison to [1].\n\nIn my understanding, the description in [2] may be pricise, all the other types are built-in types. I hope someone being good at this point can improve this contradiction.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "tclfs", "id": 14888862, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODg4ODYy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14888862?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tclfs", "html_url": "https://github.com/tclfs", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tclfs/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tclfs/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tclfs/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tclfs/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tclfs/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tclfs/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tclfs/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tclfs/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tclfs/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/32762/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/32762/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
