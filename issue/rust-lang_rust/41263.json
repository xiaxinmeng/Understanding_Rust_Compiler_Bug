In clone_from and assignment, the data moves right-to-left, but this moves it left-to-right. And that means that autoref doesn't work well, usually forcing you to write &mut.\r\n\r\n- [ ] But fixing that would mean putting it somewhere else, since the Self in ToOwned is the wrong type for what this needs to be.
