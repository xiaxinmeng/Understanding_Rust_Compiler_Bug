Generally, the only new language features added after this milestone must be backwards compatible, or to fix soundness holes, though we do expect to have some leeway to make small incompatible fixes that have low impact on existing code bases.\r\n\r\n* Library stability - We have a system of measuring and ensuring the stability of API's, and a significant portion of the standard library is declared stable. Stable API's will not change. Large portions of the standard library need to be stable for 1.0, including primitive types, vectors, strings, option, numerics, collections, some I/O and concurrency.\r\n\r\n* User experience - The system is polished and the presentation is complete and professional. New users have a clear path to using and learning the system. This encompasses the web site, documentation, installation, and tooling.\r\n", "creator": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 376, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2013-10-10T18:48:33Z", "updated_at": "2016-08-28T23:13:24Z", "due_on": "2015-05-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2015-05-21T20:59:13Z"}, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2013-11-11T23:45:39Z", "updated_at": "2014-02-12T17:21:51Z", "closed_at": "2014-02-12T17:21:51Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "There is currently an `XXX` on the seek trait asking a question about what to do about seeks out of bounds of the current file. Additionally, this leads to the `fail!()`-ing implementations of `Seek` on `MemReader`, `BufReader`, and `BufWriter`. `MemWriter` currently has an implementation that fills with 0s when you seek beyond the end and then perform a write.\n\nIn my opinion, the semantics should be defined as:\n- If you seek to a negative offset, return an error immediately (from the call to seek).\n- If you seek within \"the file\", we're all good\n- If you seek beyond the end of \"the file\", then it's a valid operation and it's left up to the implementation to decide what to do afterwards. For example, a writer may decide to fill the intermediate gap with 0s. On the other hand, a reader would return an EndOfFile error on the next read (etc.).\n\nThis behavior follows what `lseek` + `read` + `write` appear to do. Regardless, we need to decide on this for 1.0.
