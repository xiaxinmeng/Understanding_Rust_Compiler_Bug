I think it would be good to make a decision before it reaches stable.\r\n\r\nI have a concern that this introduces three styles of enums, and I think it would be best to only have two styles.  In summary, as of 1.56, they will be:\r\n\r\nKind 1: Unit-only variants:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// Does not require repr\r\nenum Kind1 {\r\n    Foo = 1,\r\n    Bar = 2,\r\n    Baz = 3,\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Can be cast to its discriminant:\r\nlet x = Kind1::Foo as u8;\r\n```\r\n\r\nKind 2: Tuple or struct variants without fields:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[repr(u8)]   // Required repr\r\nenum Kind2 {\r\n    Foo() = 1,\r\n    Bar{} = 2,\r\n    Baz = 3,\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Can be cast to its discriminant:\r\nlet x = Kind2::Foo() as u8;\r\n```\r\n\r\nKind 3: Tuple or struct variants with fields:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[repr(u8)]   // Required repr\r\nenum Kind3 {\r\n    Foo(i32) = 1,\r\n    Bar{f: i32} = 2,\r\n    Bar = 3,\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ERROR: Does not allow casting.\r\nlet x = Kind3::Foo(1) as u8;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe question mainly centers on how `Kind2` should be treated.  #88203 is a proposal to make it treated the same as `Kind1` (that is, does not require `repr`).  Another proposal is to make it treated the same as `Kind3` (does not allow casting), PR up at #89234.  Another option it to leave it as-is, and keep three styles.\r\n\r\nOnly `Kind1` is allowed in 1.55 and older versions.\r\n\r\n(As an aside, this also highlights that our current terminology of \"Fieldless enums\" is confusing, since it has historically meant only `Kind1` style, but it can be confused with `Kind2` since those do not have fields, either.)\r\n\r\nMore discussion at https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/213817-t-lang/topic/arbitrary.20enum.20discriminants/near/251899236\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "ehuss", "id": 43198, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTk4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43198?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss", "html_url": "https://github.com/ehuss", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88621/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88621/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
