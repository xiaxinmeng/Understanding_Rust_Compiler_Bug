This code snippet from `trans::base::trans_assign_op` illustrates the problem:\n\n```\n        ret move_val(bcx, DROP_EXISTING, lhs_res.val,\n                     // FIXME: should kind be owned?\n                     {bcx: bcx, val: target, kind: owned},\n                     dty);\n```\n\n`bcx` has type `block`, which is now a newtype-like enum whose LHS is an @ of a class. The bug is exposed by the fact that `block` doesn't get treated as immediate even though its representation is a box, but that's not the main bug. The main problem is that there's an implicit move because of the second use of `bcx` as a field in the record literal: it's a last use, implying that `bcx` gets zeroed at that point. Normally, borrowck would flag a move of something that has a reference to it (the reference gets brought about by the first instance of `bcx`, as the first argument to `move_val`). But since the implicit moves due to last-use information aren't visible to borrowck, the code happily compiles, runs, and then segfaults when `move_val` dereferences its first argument.\n\n@nikomatsakis and I discussed this a bit on IRC and there's not a clear solution (though there is an obvious workaround for #2584). Perhaps the answer is to just remove last-use analysis.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "catamorphism", "id": 427212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzIxMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/427212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism", "html_url": "https://github.com/catamorphism", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2633/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2633/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
