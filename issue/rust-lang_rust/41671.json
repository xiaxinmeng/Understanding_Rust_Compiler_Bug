Even experts seem to get it wrong, as well-respected libraries like num_complex and nalgebra can be missing common traits like MulAssign or Sum.\r\n\r\nI think it would be nice to have, somewhere in the standard Rust documentation, a centralized glossary of standard Rust traits which provides a short description of each of them and links to more extensive documentation whenever necessary (e.g. to the Nomicon for Send/Sync).\r\n\r\nA very good starting point would be https://llogiq.github.io/2015/07/30/traits.html . Here is what I would do before integration in the standard documentation:\r\n\r\n- Get the author's permission to reuse the original text: no need to reinvent the wheel :)\r\n- Add a lexicographically ordered index at the top or in a sidebar.\r\n- Decide how much detail we want to put in there, versus how much we want to link to more detailed references like the llogiq blog post.\r\n- Clarify that \"Rem\" may not work like C/++ developers would expect.\r\n- Add documentation of the XyzAssign traits, Product/Sum, and any other trait we can find in the std reference which is not covered there already.\r\n- Maybe add or link to a more extensive discussion of Rust iterators when discussion the various Iterator traits.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else that comes to someone's mind?", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/41671/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/41671/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
