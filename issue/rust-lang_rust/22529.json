But that's not a question for today.)  \n\nA number of compiler passes in `rustc` are not really equipped to deal with such types.\n\nWe could (and should) write code to detect such types early on, (perhaps in the well-formedness checking code in wf.rs), and report an error to the user with appropriate feedback about the source of the non-regular recursion.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pnkfelix", "id": 173127, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173127?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix", "html_url": "https://github.com/pnkfelix", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22529/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22529/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
