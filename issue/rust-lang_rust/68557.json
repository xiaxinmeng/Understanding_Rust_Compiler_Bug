However, as trait methods cannot be `const` (maybe in the far future if we have const traits), the logic inside these `cmp` and `partial_cmp` methods is unavailable in `const` contexts. \r\n\r\nThe only exceptions to this are the `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` operators for some primitives: floating-point numbers, integers, `bool`, `char` and `!`, which are (I think) `const` intrinsics. Note that these operators all result in a `bool`, there is no `const` comparison function resulting in a `std::cmp::Ordering`. This makes custom `const` lexicographical comparisons still hard to write compared to using `std::cmp::Ordering::then` (also not yet `const`).\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nAdd a const inherent comparison method to applicable types and let the `Ord` and `PartialOrd` delegate to this method:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl T {\r\n  pub const fn cmp(&self, other: &T) -> std::cmp::Ordering { \r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Ord for T {\r\n  fn cmp(&self, other: &T) -> std::cmp::Ordering {\r\n    self.cmp(other)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl PartialOrd for T {\r\n  fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &T) -> Option<std::cmp::Ordering> {\r\n    Some(self.cmp(other))\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a conservative implementation, only implement a `const` comparison method for integers first. The operators `>`, `<`, `>=` and `<=` are already `const` for these types. Together with making `std::cmp::Ordering::then` `const` this will make doing a lexicographical on integer fields easier inside a `const` context.\r\n\r\nAfter implementation for integers `const` comparison methods could be added to floating-point numbers and other primitives. Later more complex types could also be extended.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n1. Wait for stabilization of `#[feature(const_if_match)]` (#49146).\r\n2. Add `const` comparison methods to integers (under #53718).\r\n3. Make `std::cmp::Ordering::then` `const`.\r\n4. Decide on other types to implement a `const` comparison method for.\r\n\r\n### Drawbacks / open questions\r\n1. Any comparisons involving generics like `Vec<T>` or `(T, U)` requires traits and can thus not be made `const` with this proposal.\r\n   - The comparison of a type like `String`, which internally uses a `Vec<u8>`, could technically be `const`, just by special casing and by not relying on a generic `Vec` comparison implementation.\r\n   - The same goes for any composition of primitives, such as arrays and tuples. This would however require even more special cases.\r\n2. Name of the method: `cmp`? This would shadow the `Ord` trait, does that lead to complications? Alternative: `compare`, ...\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n1. Leave situation as is: `>`, `<`, `<=` and `>=` are already `const` for integers, thus a `const cmp(self, other) -> std::cmp::Ordering` does not pull it's weight to necessitate an addition to the standard library.\r\n   1. Wait for `const` traits and make a `const` version of Ord and PartialOrd,\r\n   2. Wait for `const` trait methods and make `Ord::cmp` and `PartialOrd::partial_ord` `const` (breaking change).\r\n   3. If really necessary a local `const` helper method can easily be written by a user: `const fn cmp(a: u8, b: u8) -> Ordering { if a < b { Less } else if a == b { Equal } else { Greater } }`", "closed_by": {"login": "jonas-schievink", "id": 1786438, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY0Mzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786438?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonas-schievink", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/68557/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/68557/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
