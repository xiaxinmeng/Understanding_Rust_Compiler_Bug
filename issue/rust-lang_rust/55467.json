(#61883)\r\n   - [x] Lint: `confusable_idents`(#71542, #72770)\r\n   - [x] Lint: ~`less_used_codepoints`~ `uncommon_codepoints` (#67810)\r\n   - [x] Adjustments to \"<del>bad style</del>`non_standard_style`\" lints. (See #73839)\r\n   - [x] Lint: `mixed_script_confusables`(#72770)\r\n   - [x] Provide reusable crates for above lints and checks on crates.io. ([unicode-security](https://docs.rs/unicode-security))\r\n   - [x] Similarly to out-of-line modules (`mod \u0444\u043e\u043e;`), extern crates and paths with a first segment naming a crate should not be able to do filesystem search using those non-ASCII identifiers (i.e. no , `extern crate \u044c\u0430\u0433;` or `\u043c\u0443_\u0441\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0435::baz`). (#73305)\r\n   - [x] Disallow using non-ascii identifiers in extern blocks.(#83936)\r\n- [x] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on forge][doc-guide]) (https://github.com/rust-lang/reference/pull/999)\r\n- [x] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on forge][stabilization-guide]) (#83799)\r\n\r\n[stabilization-guide]: https://forge.rust-lang.org/stabilization-guide.html\r\n[doc-guide]: https://forge.rust-lang.org/stabilization-guide.html#updating-documentation\r\n\r\n**Unresolved questions:**\r\n\r\n[TR31Layout]: https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Layout_and_Format_Control_Characters\r\n\r\n* [ ] Which context is adequate for confusable detection: file, current scope, crate?\r\n* [ ] Should [ZWNJ and ZWJ be allowed in identifiers][TR31Layout]?\r\n* [x] How are non-ASCII idents best supported in debuggers? \r\n        Resolved: DWARF and debuggers handle UTF-8 just fine\r\n* [x] Which name mangling scheme is used by the compiler? (Punycode, see [RFC2603](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2603))\r\n* [x] Is there a better name for the `less_used_codepoints` lint?\r\n       Resolved in favour of `uncommon_codepoints`\r\n* [x] Which lint should the global mixed scripts confusables detection trigger? \r\n       Resolved in favor of `mixed_script_confusables`\r\n* [ ] How badly do non-ASCII idents exacerbate const pattern confusion\r\n  (rust-lang/rust#7526, rust-lang/rust#49680)?\r\n  Can we improve precision of linting here?\r\n* [ ] In `mixed_script_confusables`, do we actually need to make an exception for `Latin` identifiers?\r\n* [ ] Terminal width is a tricky with unicode. Some characters are long, some have lengths dependent on the fonts installed (e.g. emoji sequences), and modifiers are a thing. The concept of monospace font doesn't generalize to other scripts as well. How does rustfmt deal with this when determining line width?\r\n* [x] right-to-left scripts can lead to weird rendering in mixed contexts (depending on the software used), especially when mixed with operators. This is not something that should block stabilization, however we feel it is important to explicitly call out. Future RFCs (preferably put forth by RTL-using communities) may attempt to improve this situation (e.g. by allowing bidi control characters in specific contexts).\r\n* [ ] Tweak `XID_Start` / `XID_Continue`? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/4928\r\n  > http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1518.htm\r\n  >\r\n  > The ISO JTC1/SC22/WG14 (C language) think that possibly UTR#31 didn't quite hit the nail on the head in terms of defining identifier syntax. They have a couple tweaks in mind. Consider following their lead.\r\n\r\n----\r\nzulip channel topic for real-time discussion:\r\nhttps://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/213817-t-lang/topic/nonascii.20identifiers(rfc.202457)\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "crlf0710", "id": 451806, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTgwNg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/451806?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710", "html_url": "https://github.com/crlf0710", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55467/reactions", "total_count": 96, "+1": 46, "-1": 9, "laugh": 7, "hooray": 10, "confused": 0, "heart": 13, "rocket": 6, "eyes": 5}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55467/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
