Some benchmark functions might depend on some runtime initialisation which may fail. For example:\n\n``` rust\n#[bench]\nfn bench_this(b : &mut Bencher) {\n    if let Ok(val) = WillFailOnEvenHour::new() {\n        b.iter(||{ var.current_hour_is_not_even() });\n    } else {\n        // nothing to bench here? Maybe print an error?\n        println!(\"Benchmarks on even hours are forbidden!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWill print \u201cBenchmarks on even hours are forbidden!\u201d a lot of times. If one opts to not report set-up failure, the benchmark function just keeps processor hot for a while without actually benchmarking anything (and reporting 0ns/iter anyway).\n\nWould it be sensible to (one of possible solutions):\n- Not run the same `#[bench]` function multiple times, since iteration is done by `.iter`;\n- Not run the same `#[bench]` again if `Bencher::iter` is not called at least once;\n- Provide a method on `Bencher` to cancel all subsequent runs of the `#[bench]` function?\n\nOr maybe my approach is incorrect?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20142/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20142/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
