I'd like to open a separate issue for just these two crates.\n\nWe have a [request in Gecko](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1163224#c36) to stabilize the ability to route allocations to specifically `malloc` (on all platforms). This includes Windows, where currently `alloc_system` routes to functions like `HeapAlloc`.\n\nEssentially, one of these crates, or perhaps a new crate like them, may want to have an accelerated path to stabilization before allocators themselves. For example I wouldn't want to stabilize `#![allocator]` or `#![needs_allocator]`, but we could stabilize the semantics of `extern crate alloc_malloc` redirects all allocations to malloc (for example).\n\nNominating for discussion!\n\ncc @rust-lang/libs \ncc @froydnj\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33082/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33082/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
