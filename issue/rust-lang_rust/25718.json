It is often desirable to offset-by-0 from this in general code to avoid complicating things with special-cases for ZSTs or empty array iterators.\n\nUnfortunately it is possible to interpret the LLVM GEP docs to determine that `heap::EMPTY.offset(0)` (which is marked as inbounds unconditionally) has undefined behaviour, because heap::EMPTY is not actually allocated. I see two ways forward for this: mark `heap::EMPTY` as allocated in some way for LLVM, or ensure `offset(0)` is always safe. I favour the latter, simply because it's plausible to want to offset by 0 off some other ptrs. However the former is acceptable if this is not possible.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Gankra", "id": 1136864, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjExMzY4NjQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1136864?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra", "html_url": "https://github.com/Gankra", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25718/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25718/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
