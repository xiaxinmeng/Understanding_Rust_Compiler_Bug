For an invocation `assert_not_impl!(Type: Trait)`, it emits code like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nconst _: () = {\r\n    trait Blanket {}\r\n    impl<T: Trait> Blanket for T {}\r\n    impl Blanket for Type {}\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe goal was to cause a trait impl conflict if the `Trait` was spuriously implemented. I found that while this worked for sized types, it didn't catch the error for unsized types. In other words, the following code fails to compile:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nstruct Foo;\r\n\r\ntrait Bar {}\r\n\r\nimpl Bar for Foo {}\r\n\r\nconst _: () = {\r\n    trait Blanket {}\r\n    impl<T: Bar> Blanket for T {}\r\n    impl Blanket for Foo {}\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n...with this error:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nerror[[E0119]](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/error-index.html#E0119): conflicting implementations of trait `_::Blanket` for type `Foo`\r\n  --> src/lib.rs:10:5\r\n   |\r\n9  |     impl<T: Bar> Blanket for T {}\r\n   |     -------------------------- first implementation here\r\n10 |     impl Blanket for Foo {}\r\n   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ conflicting implementation for `Foo`\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if we modify `Foo` to be an unsized type, the code compiles successfully:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nstruct Foo([u8]);\r\n\r\ntrait Bar {}\r\n\r\nimpl Bar for Foo {}\r\n\r\nconst _: () = {\r\n    trait Blanket {}\r\n    impl<T: Bar> Blanket for T {}\r\n    impl Blanket for Foo {}\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced that this is a bug, but it's certainly surprising, and might point to a bug.\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n1.65.0", "closed_by": {"login": "joshlf", "id": 1046063, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDYwNjM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1046063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf", "html_url": "https://github.com/joshlf", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshlf/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/104297/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/104297/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
