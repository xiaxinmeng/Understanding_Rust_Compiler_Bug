I recently updated cargo via rustup and started noticing that my code breaks when run.\r\n\r\nI am currently running MacOS 10.12.6 and rustc 1.20.0\r\n\r\nThis is a contrived example, mostly from the upstream \"rust-hyperscan\" project, which includes the output error I'm seeing when I run`cargo clean && cargo test`: https://gist.github.com/shayanjm/aa7a9ebb0bddd1beb8ec4f3d3f87463b\r\n\r\nOn L80 of build.rs (https://gist.github.com/shayanjm/aa7a9ebb0bddd1beb8ec4f3d3f87463b#file-build-rs-L80) I've verified that the `println!` runs as expected by changing c++ to something I know would break and retrying `cargo clean && cargo test`.\r\n\r\nI've also verified that libc++ has the symbols in question via `nm -gU /usr/lib/libc++dylib | grep dynamic`, which returned `0000000000018c54 I ___dynamic_cast` (the first \"undefined symbol\" in the error)\r\n\r\nIs this an issue with the way rustc is linking the c++ std lib? Or have I done something wrong?", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44926/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44926/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
