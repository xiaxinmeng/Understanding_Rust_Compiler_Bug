These lints have recently become of interest for `libc` because of [RFC2235](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2235-libc-struct-traits.md). However, since some of these traits rely on manual implementations, it'd be useful to have lints to fail CI should any desired lints be missed in a PR.\r\n\r\nGiven that two of these lints already exist and the API guidelines lay out a clear standard practice, I'm not certain if an RFC is required to add the rest of these lints, so I'm raising this issue. My plan is to work through adding the lints for `Clone`, `Eq`, `Hash`, and `PartialEq`, as they're required for rust-lang/libc#1217.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58066/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58066/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
