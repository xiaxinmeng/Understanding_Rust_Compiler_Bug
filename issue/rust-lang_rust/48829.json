It's hoped that if we have a historical record of the duration of CI builds which is relatively consistent and granular we can more easily see regressions that happen over time and diagnose otherwise obvious-in-retrospect problems with the build.\r\n\r\nThe current thinking for how this might be done is to instrument rustbuild to, by default on CI, emit timing information about each step in a structured fashion. The thinking is we could then scrape the logs of all our CI builds to aggregate this structure data. The data needs to include enough information so that it can indeed be easily aggregated. For example we shouldn't have to look at the Travis environment to guess whether it's an OSX/Linux build or which architecture is being assembled.\r\n\r\nOnce we've got this data we can hopefully set up graphs over time like https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-pr-tracking/ to see what time is going where. CI timings are *very* noisy but the hope is that general trends will still be relatively clear.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48829/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48829/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
