I think it might be worthwhile to run them on one CI builder for Linux, just to give a little more coverage.  However, it's not really clear if anyone is actually using rust-lldb.  \r\n\r\nI discovered this because the debuginfo tests always fail on my local development system because I have lldb installed.  This was a little frustrating, so I investigated and discovered that the [`pretty-std-collections.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/debuginfo/pretty-std-collections.rs) was not being tested on CI because it is ignored on macos, and it was broken a while ago.\r\n\r\nIt might be as easy as just adding `apt install lldb` to a builder.  I don't think it is important to try to build it from source. Note that due to some oddity with how lldb apt package is installed, there is a missing symlink.  Something like `ln -s /usr/lib/llvm-10/bin/lldb-server /usr/bin/lldb-server-10.0.0` may be needed to get it to work.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/81813/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/81813/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
