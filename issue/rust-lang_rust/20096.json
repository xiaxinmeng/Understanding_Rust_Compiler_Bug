http://www.rust-lang.org/\n- Click on Nightly API Docs, which goes to http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html\n- Search for `replace`\n- Click on the result for `regex::Regex::replace`, which goes to http://doc.rust-lang.org/regex/enum.Regex.html#method.replace\n- This gives me a github pages 404.\n\n**This appears to be isolated to the regex, getopts, log, and time crates**, I tried to reproduce this with every crate and I got 404s when doing the following searches on the following results, but not for results from the other crates:\n- search for `replace`, click on `regex::Regex::replace` (or any other `regex::*` result)\n- search for  `opts`, click on `getopts::getopts` (or any other `getopts::*` result)\n- search for `debug`, click on `log::DEBUG` (or any other `log::*` result)\n- search for `time`, click on `time::Tm::asctime` (or any other `time::*` result)\n\nWhat's weird is if I try to reproduce this locally by doing:\n- cd to my rust checkout\n- `$ open doc/std/index.html`\n- Search for `replace`\n- Click on the result for `regex::Regex::replace`, which goes to file://[my rust checkout]/doc/regex/enum.Regex.html#method.replace\n- **This works fine!** I see the doc page I expect!\n\nI also found these other cases of 404s, which might be separate issues-- I'm happy to file them if someone agrees:\n- In the results for a search for `opts`, the result for `rustrt::task::TaskOpts` goes to http://doc.rust-lang.org/rustrt/task/struct.TaskOpts.html which gives me a **rust** 404 page (the one that directs you to search ddg, the reference, or the docs). \n- The sidebar link to the regex_macros crate (http://doc.rust-lang.org/regex_macros/index.html) gives me a github pages 404, and the sidebar link to rustrt (http://doc.rust-lang.org/rustrt/index.html) gives me a rust 404.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url":
