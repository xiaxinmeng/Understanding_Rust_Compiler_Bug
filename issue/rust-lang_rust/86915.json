However I think it would be cool if one could search for generic types (which is also possible in the \"role model\" of this feature, hoogle). For example on `Result<T>` and `Option<T>` there are lots of conversion functions into other types that aren't searchable at the moment due to their generic nature.\r\n\r\nFor example on `Option<T>` there are\r\n- map function and variants\r\n- ok function and variants\r\n- unwrap function and variants\r\n\r\nand more that are not searchable at the moment by a type signature but all named very similarly so an inexperienced user could easily end up looking around for the proper variant for quite a bit. If the type signature search would support generics the user could just type out the more precise signature they are looking for and easily find the proper variant.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86915/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86915/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
