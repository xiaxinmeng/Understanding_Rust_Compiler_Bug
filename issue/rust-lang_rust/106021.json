current nightly on Ventura (13.1), it fails to link with errors like:\r\n\r\n`ld: in /Users/matthew/workspace/matrix-rust-sdk/target/aarch64-apple-ios-macabi/dbg/deps/libstatic_assertions-fdafb4b8ba800a8a.rlib(lib.rmeta), building for Mac Catalyst, but linking in object file built for , file '/Users/matthew/workspace/matrix-rust-sdk/target/aarch64-apple-ios-macabi/dbg/deps/libstatic_assertions-fdafb4b8ba800a8a.rlib' for architecture arm64`\r\n\r\nThis is because the synthetic Mach-O object files (symbols.o and lib.rmeta) emitted by `object` lack LC_BUILD_VERSION load commands to identify them as compatible with Catalyst, so ld complains they have a blank platform: \"linking in object file built for ,\".\r\n\r\nrustc uses gimli's `object` to write these object files, so `object` needs to be extended to support writing LC_BUILD_VERSION, and then rustc needs to be fixed to write it when building for Catalyst.\r\n\r\nI hacked this together as per https://gist.github.com/ara4n/320a53ea768aba51afad4c9ed2168536, but a) this is the first time i've written any rust, b) turns out i don't need Catalyst after all, c) i'm not sure the changes to `object` have the right abstractions, d) I don't have bandwidth to land it.
