In fact it can't even write out crate metadata. It has to learn how.\n\nTasks here involve:\n- Make up a serial encoding of crate metadata that is efficient to incrementally parse and\n  seek around inside of, but also stable and simple enough that we're not likely to break it\n  all the time as we hack on rustc.\n- Compose a metadata blob of this sort and write it out as a special .note.rust section via\n  LLVM. Not sure exactly what support it has for making up our own section names. Try\n  your best.\n- Mangle the symbols inside a given crate using the mangling scheme outlined in this\n  mailing list post: https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2010-December/000164.html\n- When you 'use' a crate, scan for the .note.rust section (might need to port the objfile\n  sniffer from rustboot, see for example boot/be/elf.ml 'sniff' and friends) and read its\n  contents into the compilation-crate namespace. Lazily load additional components of\n  the 'use'd crate namespace as references and imports demand.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pcwalton", "id": 157897, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton", "html_url": "https://github.com/pcwalton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/244/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/244/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
