Thanks for all the hard work.\n\nI ran across this one today, thought I would report it:\n\n`use`ing a module that doesn't exist not only causes an unresolved import error, but it seems like names which are part of the Rust prelude are also reported as being undefined. The expected behavior would be that I see _just_ the unresolved import error. I came across this when copying a bunch of files to a new repo, got a ton of these errors filling my console, and spent a while trying to figure out if I had somehow shadowed or un-`use`d the rust prelude...\n\nHere's a minimal example that reproduces it for me ('Option' and 'Some' are reported as undefined): https://gist.github.com/mhintz/c40749d774f2e88ad5c9\n\n`rustc --version --verbose:\nrustc 1.8.0-beta.2 (2879d940a 2016-03-22)\nbinary: rustc\ncommit-hash: 2879d940a16adeaccc1bff4ad0eeb14ad7c91b37\ncommit-date: 2016-03-22\nhost: x86_64-apple-darwin\nrelease: 1.8.0-beta.2`\n\nedit: added --verbose output\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/32511/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/32511/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
