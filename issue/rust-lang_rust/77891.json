There are other ways to write this test but this tells me the values on failure.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nmacro_rules! static_assert_ints_eq {\r\n    ($a:expr, $b:expr) => {\r\n        // todo: enforce that args are reasonable integers\r\n        const _: [(); $a as usize] = [(); $b as usize];\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLater, I called it in a manner where the values were equal but negative. They were the result of a const function, but something like this is equivalent:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nstatic_assert_ints_eq!(-1i32, -1i32);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected this to be relatively cheap for rustc \u2014 I was hoping that the `const _:` indicates that I'm just looking for a type check.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I had to kill the compiler because it was taking too long. I imagine there's a bug somewhere for this but could not find it, but if not, this can be that bug.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.49.0-nightly (38d911dfc 2020-10-09)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 38d911dfc55a7a1eea1c80139113ed2ff0151087\r\ncommit-date: 2020-10-09\r\nhost: x86_64-apple-darwin\r\nrelease: 1.49.0-nightly\r\nLLVM version: 11.0\r\n```\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "jonas-schievink", "id": 1786438, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY0Mzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786438?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonas-schievink", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77891/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77891/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
