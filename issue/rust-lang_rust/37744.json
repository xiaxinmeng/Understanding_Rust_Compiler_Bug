From stackoverflow I find myself at `BufReader.lines()` and then [`BufRead.lines()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.BufRead.html#method.lines) docs.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm finding confusing in the docs is that `lines()` returns a Result, but the example in the docs blindly `unwrap()`s that result, and so does every caller of `lines()` I find in demo code.  It would be nice if BufRead (or, if it's more appropriate there, then maybe in BufReader's impl) would explain under what circumstances you'd get an error instead of `Ok` when reading a file, so I know if `unwrap()` is appropriate to use or not.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37744/reactions", "total_count": 9, "+1": 9, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37744/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
