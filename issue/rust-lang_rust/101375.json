\ud83d\udc1b Please provide a short summary of the bug,\r\nalong with any information you feel relevant to replicating the bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI tried this code:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    extern \"C\" fn bye() {\r\n        print!(\"hello, world!\");\r\n    }\r\n    unsafe { libc::atexit(bye) };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### I expected to see this happen:\r\nThe code should print \"hello, world!\", which it does if any `print` statement occurred before it (see the [test](`src/test/ui/runtime/stdout-during-shutdown.rs`)).\r\n\r\n#### Instead, this happened:\r\nNothing is printed to standard output.\r\n\r\nThe bug is in the cleanup function that disables buffering during shutdown:\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/92086258e30ae59610a1b1097d97227377db0ada/library/std/src/io/stdio.rs#L613-L625\r\nIf the buffer has not been initialized yet, that will not occur, so the `print` statement will initialize the buffer in the normal fashion and it will not be flushed.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n<!--\r\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\r\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.63.0 (4b91a6ea7 2022-08-08)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 4b91a6ea7258a947e59c6522cd5898e7c0a6a88f\r\ncommit-date: 2022-08-08\r\nhost: aarch64-apple-darwin\r\nrelease: 1.63.0\r\nLLVM version: 14.0.5\r\n```\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/101375/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/101375/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
