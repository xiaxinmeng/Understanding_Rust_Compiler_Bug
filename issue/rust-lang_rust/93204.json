In that\r\ncase, you can use use `issue = \"none\"` in your initial implementation PR. The\r\nreviewer will ask you to open a tracking issue if they agree your feature can be\r\nadded without an RFC.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFeature gate: `#![feature(wrapping_int_assign_impl)]`\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for adding basic integer operations to the `Wrapping` type:\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut value = Wrapping(2u8);\r\nvalue += 3u8;\r\nvalue -= 1u8;\r\nvalue *= 2u8;\r\nvalue /= 2u8;\r\nvalue %= 2u8;\r\nvalue ^= 255u8;\r\nvalue |= 123u8;\r\nvalue &= 2u8;\r\n```\r\nAs well as\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut value = Wrapping(2u8);\r\nlet _: Wrapping<u8> = value + 3u8;\r\nlet _: Wrapping<u8> = value - 1u8;\r\nlet _: Wrapping<u8> = value * 2u8;\r\nlet _: Wrapping<u8> = value / 2u8;\r\nlet _: Wrapping<u8> = value % 2u8;\r\nlet _: Wrapping<u8> = value ^ 255u8;\r\nlet _: Wrapping<u8> = value | 123u8;\r\nlet _: Wrapping<u8> = value & 2u8;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor larger features, more steps might be involved.\r\nIf the feature is changed later, please add those PRs here as well.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n - [x] Proposal for this implementation:  #91586\r\n - [ ] Implementation of `wrapping_int_assign_impl` #93208\r\n - [ ] Final comment period (FCP)\r\n - [ ] Stabilization PR\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOnce the feature has gone through a few release cycles and there are no\r\nunresolved questions left, the feature might be ready for stabilization.\r\n\r\nIf this feature didn't go through the RFC process, a final comment period\r\n(FCP) is always needed before stabilization. This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library API team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncomment period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised.
