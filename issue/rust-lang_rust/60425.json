This results in JSON messages containing `level: \"\"`, which I'm not sure how to interpret.  \r\n\r\nThis was added in #48684, though reading that PR I can't really figure out why it was added and how it relates to compiletest changes.\r\n\r\nAn easy way to see this is to trigger a diagnostic that prints \"For more information\u2026\", for example:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// E0005\r\nlet Some(_y) = Some(1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill emit a JSON value like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"message\": \"For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0005`.\",\r\n  \"code\": null,\r\n  \"level\": \"\",\r\n  \"spans\": [],\r\n  \"children\": [],\r\n  \"rendered\": \"For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0005`.\\n\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe empty string is not very descriptive of how to handle the message.  I would suggest having it serialize to something more deliberate, such as \"failure-note\".  I can't really tell what the intent of `FailureNote` is, so it's hard to say what it should be.  \r\n\r\ncc @GuillaumeGomez who might know more.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60425/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60425/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
