Both `gtk3` and `gtk4` link to `core` using `--extern-html-root-url`, however it doesn't allow to look for items in `core` from neither of them.\r\n\r\nThe idea would be to query the `search-index.js` file from rustdoc front-end. However it brings the potential following issues:\r\n * The file could not be found.\r\n * It forces us to refresh the crate search filter (because we have new ones).\r\n * It allows to load an unknown JS file and hope for the best (which is problematic in term of security).\r\n\r\nAnother option could be to simply generate the search index for those crates and use the `--extern-html-root-url` option to allow to go to the item from the search result. It would force us to add an option to only generate a search index for a crate and not its documentation though.\r\n\r\nOut of the two appraoches, I think the second option is better.\r\n\r\nHowever, do we want such a feature? Would it be useful to enough users to make this development/maintenance \"worth it\"? What do you think @rust-lang/rustdoc ?\r\n\r\ncc @sdroege ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86715/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86715/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
