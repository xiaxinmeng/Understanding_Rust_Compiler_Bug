But I think adding a `define!` macro will make the standard lib more consistent since Rust already has an `include!` macro.  \r\n\r\nThis macro will function just like #define in C.\r\n\r\nSometimes you just need these less than ideal primitive solutions. They aren't recommended but they should be there just like `include!`. Obviously `define! ` paired with `cfg!` is very powerful. The current solution is just not good enough. \r\n\r\nRust's `define!` macro should only apply to the current scope.\r\n\r\nOne problem with #define in C, is that some people overuse it and create their own little unreadable language. Since in Rust you don't have to copy paste your own code everywhere and the `define!` macro only applies to the current scope this shouldn't be a problem in Rust. If you are unsure what something means it will probably be written inside the current scope or at the top of the file. No spaghetti.\r\n\r\nThis feature just like `include!` will not be recommended to use. The possibility should still be there. Rust is safe but not limiting. \r\n\r\n ", "closed_by": {"login": "jonas-schievink", "id": 1786438, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY0Mzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786438?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonas-schievink", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62190/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62190/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
