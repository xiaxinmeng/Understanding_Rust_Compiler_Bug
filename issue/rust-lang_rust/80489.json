I am *still* not quite sure about what we discussed(the smart ideas were not mine). Please correct me on the things I have gotten wrong and I will update this post. I believe the gist of it is:\r\n\r\nSome functions, like `align_offset` contains code that is impossible to evaluate in a const context, but the functionality does exist in miri. One potential solution for making `align_offset` a const fn  would be to add an attribute, say `#[rustc_const_intrinsic]` that would make the function look like a `const fn` from the outside but would still be allowed to contain non-const code. When the function is called during runtime the contents of the function is executed as expected. However if called in a const context, the const evaluator would catch the call and instead invoke its special logic.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80489/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80489/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
