And we've shipped target-specific SIMD on x86-64 and aarch64. There will always be more CPUs to support, but that doesn't mean this issue needs to remain open indefinitely.\r\n> \r\n> We've shipped this; closing.\r\n\r\nThe stdsimd feature flag was also removed from all x86/x86_64 intrinsics a long time ago. However, I can see that the `core_arch` crate is included as an unstable submodule guarded by `#[feature(stdsimd)]` inside of libcore:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// Pull in the `core_arch` crate directly into libcore.
