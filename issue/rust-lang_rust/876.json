The error arises when trying to print out a unification error (`char` doesn't unify with `option::t<T>`). However, because the program doesn't explicitly import `option::t`, and only the def_id for `t` (not the `ident`) is in the type in the crate metadata, the def_id for `option_t` doesn't map to anything in the ext_map.\n\nThe program works as expected (fails in typestate instead) if you replace `char` with `option::t<char>` (and add an import for `std::option::*`).\n\nI'm not really sure what the solution is to this, other than changing the metadata format to include both the ident and the def_id for a `ty_tag` thing.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/876/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/876/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
