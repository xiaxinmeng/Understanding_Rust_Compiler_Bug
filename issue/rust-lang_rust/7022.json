I found out about this by using clang's static analysis capabilities (which can be used with `scan-build configure; scan-build make;`)\n\nHere's some of the code which I thought was weird (it starts at https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/incoming/src/rt/rust_task.cpp#L614 ):\n\n```\nbig_stack->task = this;\nbig_stack->next = stk->next;\nif (big_stack->next)\n    big_stack->next->prev = big_stack;\nbig_stack->prev = stk;\nif (stk)\n    stk->next = big_stack;\n```\n\nIn the code, `stk` is dereferenced to get to `nxt` but is then later checked at `if (stk)` to see if it is null. Either the line of code `big_stack->next = stk->next;` should be put inside a check for nullity, or there should be an assertion that `stk` is not null at the top of the method, and `stk` should not be checked at `stk->next = bit_stack;`\n\nI tried to figure out the logic here but I have no experience, and so was confused. Hopefully someone else can figure out how to correct this code.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "graydon", "id": 14097, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDk3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14097?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon", "html_url": "https://github.com/graydon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7022/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7022/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
