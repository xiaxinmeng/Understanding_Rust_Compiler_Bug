I would like to make it explicit that I am using [\"ex falso quod libet\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion) reasoning, so I write\r\n```rust\r\nfn foo(x: !) -> bool {\r\n  match x {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nUnfortunately, now Rust warns:\r\n```\r\nwarning: unreachable expression\r\n --> src/lib.rs:4:3\r\n  |\r\n4 |   match x {}\r\n  |   ^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  |\r\n  = note: #[warn(unreachable_code)] on by default\r\n```\r\nIt seems it wants me to instead write\r\n```rust\r\nfn foo(x: !) -> bool {\r\n    x\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI think that's bad style, now I have to think much harder to figure out what is going on (\"oh, there's a coercion from uninhabited types to `bool`\"). The original code I wrote uses a construct which *only works for uninhabited types*, explicitly documenting intent.\r\n\r\nI think the compiler should not print a warning for that code. Empty matches are a useful, explicit and constructive way of saying that we are dealing with uninhabited data, we shouldn't discourage them in favor of implicit coercions that require way more context to comprehend.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55116/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55116/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
