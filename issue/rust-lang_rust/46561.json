If I then want to use the derivation I have to use *both* `foo` and `foo-derive` crates.  Fine.\r\n\r\nThe problem comes if the using crate (let's call it `bar`) uses a different version of `foo` from the one that `foo-derive` does.  So let's say that `foo-derive` 1.0 has in `Cargo.toml`:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[dependencies]\r\nfoo = \"1.1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, if in `bar`'s `Cargo.toml` I mistakenly add:\r\n```toml\r\n[dependencies]\r\nfoo = \"1.0\"\r\nfoo-derive = \"1.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then use the custom derive of `Foo` within `bar`:\r\n```rust\r\n`#[derive(foo)]`\r\nstruct BarStruct{ ... }\r\n```\r\n I get the confusing error `the trait Foo is not implemented for BarStruct`.  Even though I can see using cargo-expand that the trait *is* implemented.  The point is that the derive code has implemented a *different version* of `Foo`, and the fix is to change `bar` to depend on `foo` version 1.1.   But the compiler error does not make that at all obvious!", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46561/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46561/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
