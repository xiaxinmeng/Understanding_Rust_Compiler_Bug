We should be more proactive in detecting elements that were \"recovered\" during parsing, in the same spirit as #46732.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly bad when encountering unenclosed delimiters. On this, the parser should try some really conservative local recovery (simple substitutions) and unless the rest of the code successfully compiles, the parser should discard the rest of the code until it finds a closing curly brace at the beggining of the line or EOF. This assumes that the likelihood of the following code being correct and usable is high. This type of recovery might still fail during typeck as, for example, methods might be missing. If this is the case, the `impl` block in the AST should be marked as \"recovered\" and during typeck avoid emitting errors related to it.", "closed_by": {"login": "estebank", "id": 1606434, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY0MzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1606434?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank", "html_url": "https://github.com/estebank", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48724/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48724/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
