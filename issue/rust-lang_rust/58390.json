So I found the RFC and copied the feature name `re_rebalancing_coherence` from it. However, I still got the compile error, so I spent a while trying to figure out if the impl was really valid. Eventually, I tried commenting out the impl, and then (thanks to #52644), the compiler told me the feature was unknown (it has been renamed to `re_rebalance_coherence`). The impl was valid using the correct feature name. I didn't get the error saying the feature name was invalid because of the error caused by the feature name being invalid.\r\n\r\nI think the compiler should report unknown feature names even if there are other errors. For example: https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=e46fde7bf4076220df3005d702df9cbb doesn't report the feature name is invalid. With box syntax, it suggests \"help: add #![feature(box_syntax)] to the crate attributes to enable\" but the coherence error didn't.\r\n\r\nFeel free to close this issue if you don't think it is worth fixing.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58390/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58390/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
