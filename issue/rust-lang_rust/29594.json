This issue tracks its stabilization.\r\n\r\nKnown problems:\r\n- [ ] `#[thread_local]` translates directly to the `thread_local` attribute in LLVM. This isn't supported on all platforms, and it's not even supported on all distributions within the same platform (e.g. 10.6 doesn't support it but 10.7 does). I don't think this is necessarily a blocker, but I also don't think we have many attributes and such which are so platform specific like this.\r\n- [x] Statics that are thread local shouldn't require `Sync` - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18001\r\n- [x] Statics that are thread local should either not borrow for the `'static` lifetime or should be unsafe to access - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/17954\r\n- [x] Statics can currently reference other thread local statics, but this is a bug - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18712\r\n- [ ] Unsound with generators https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49682\r\n- [ ] static mut can be given `'static` lifetime with NLL (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54366)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29594/reactions", "total_count": 42, "+1": 42, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29594/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
