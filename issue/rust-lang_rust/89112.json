While it would not be a breaking change, this could lead to confusion, as some macros would allow nesting while others would not.\n- Not allow macro composition at all\n  - This would be a breaking change, as crates already depend on this kind of syntax, but would be the easiest option for the language developers to bring consistency.\n\nIn any case, I believe not doing anything about this would leave a weird exception in the std library that would bring confusion to newcomers.", "closed_by": {"login": "AZMCode", "id": 15837568, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODM3NTY4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15837568?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/AZMCode", "html_url": "https://github.com/AZMCode", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AZMCode/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AZMCode/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AZMCode/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AZMCode/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AZMCode/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AZMCode/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AZMCode/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AZMCode/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AZMCode/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/89112/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/89112/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
