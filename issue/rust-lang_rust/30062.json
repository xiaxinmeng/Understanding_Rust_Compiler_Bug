I might have used the wrong terms. \n\nIt would be convenient in the online docs to turn the `div#versioninfo` into a doc version switcher. \n\n`div#versioninfo` is this thing on the bottom right corner of documentations pages:\n<img width=\"78\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-11-25 at 23 01 02\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/335567/11410520/7221deea-93c8-11e5-8058-ec53f9f6ca6e.png\">\n\nAt least a stable/nightly selector. I can imagine a switch between major versions later. It is not obvious for the newcomer what the URL scheme is. I just  tried a few before figuring out it was `nightly` and not `latest`.\n\nYou think might want also to set a `<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"http://doc.rust-lang.org/path/to/same/stable/page\" />` to avoid google indexing the nightly too much, and also as the same page is available under `/foo.html` and `stable/foo.html`, that should (IIUC) de-duplicate search results and increase ranking.\n\nI'm not too sure of where to fix that, and where are all the valid urls published on docs.rust-lang.org.\n\nThanks. \n", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30062/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30062/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
