Some topics to discuss:\n- Why was typestate removed?\n- Why are some types nominal instead of structural?\n- Why do I have to declare impls in the same crate as a type or trait?\n- Why is trait inheritance the only means of inheritance?\n- Why doesn't Rust do tail-call optimization?\n  (see e.g. [rust-dev post](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-April/003557.html).)\n\nExplanations should be technical and include code examples wherever possible.\n\nSome of the questions of this nature overlap with the latter half of the Language FAQ, but not all, e.g. \"Can Rust code call C code?\" and \"What is the difference between a managed pointer and an owned pointer?\" do not belong. The document should focus on large-scale design decisions and tradeoffs; think \"Why split stacks?\" rather than \"How do split stacks work?\".\n\nIf you think of good questions, add them in the comments here. There are probably a lot of ripe areas for explanation, especially with regard to mutability and regions.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4047/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4047/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
