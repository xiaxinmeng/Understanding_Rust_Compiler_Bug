I have tried marking all functions as both `#[no_mangle]` and `#[inline(never)]`, but neither had any effect.\r\n- Does anyone have a *guess* at what might be causing this? A lot of the functionality relies on calls to a C library -- is there some reason rust might be optimizing that away?\r\n\r\nWe are both pretty confused by the behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: It fails for both of these\r\n```\r\n$ rustc --version --verbose                                                       \r\nrustc 1.21.0-nightly (7eeac1b81 2017-08-30)          \r\nbinary: rustc             \r\ncommit-hash: 7eeac1b81446c6327f1827ef334eca2db7fe28f7                                                     \r\ncommit-date: 2017-08-30   \r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu                       \r\nrelease: 1.21.0-nightly   \r\nLLVM version: 4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nrustc --version --verbose                                                                                                                                                                \r\nrustc 1.19.0 (0ade33941 2017-07-17)                                                                                                                                                                                \r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 0ade339411587887bf01bcfa2e9ae4414c8900d4\r\ncommit-date: 2017-07-17\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.19.0\r\nLLVM version: 4.0\r\n```", "closed_by": {"login": "arielb1", "id": 1830974, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzA5NzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1830974?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1", "html_url": "https://github.com/arielb1", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44615/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44615/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
