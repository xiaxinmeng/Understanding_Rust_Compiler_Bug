I think this is something in rust itself needs to be fixed, I'd appreciate any pointers to potential locations inside rust that I can dig further.\r\n\r\np.s. I ended up with adding the folder of x64-x64 cl.exe into PATH, to be specific (%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Enterprise\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.16.27023\\bin\\Hostx64\\x64), and I was able to workaround this issue and built everything fine.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nChandler\r\n\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/59854/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/59854/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
