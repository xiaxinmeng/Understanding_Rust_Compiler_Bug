This issue should **not** cover the \"ordering\" of test cases that they suggested.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask that a feature to output the runtime (in float seconds to 3 significant digits) of tests be added (at least as a flag) to help find which tests are taking a long time. It would be parituclarily useful in build systems where the user might not have as much information (i.e. is not watching the tests run).\r\n\r\nWe could also consider outputting the \"system\" time as well as the \"real\" time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome possible flags:\r\n- `--report-time`\r\n- `--report-timing`\r\n- `---report-duration`\r\n\r\nBut I would be pretty open to anything.\r\n\r\n*Preferably* we would just do this by default (with no flag) but my bet is that enough people depend on the stdout of `cargo test` that that would (almost) be considered a breaking change.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46610/reactions", "total_count": 15, "+1": 15, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46610/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
