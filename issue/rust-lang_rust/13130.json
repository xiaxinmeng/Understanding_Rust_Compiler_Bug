See the gist at:\n\n  https://gist.github.com/tfogal/9762303#file-simple-rs\n\nSee specifically the 'dumpf32' implementation.\n\nWhen running with rust from 2014-03-21 (201403210405~6eae7df~saucy) on Ubuntu, the output file in this example is only 2147479552 bytes, whereas it should be exactly 4000000000 bytes.\n\nThis was fixed on 2014-03-25 in 201403210405~6eae7df~saucy.  However, one can induce failure by forcing libgreen, via:\n\n  extern crate green;\n  extern crate rustuv;\n  ...\n  #[start]\n  fn start(argc: int, argv: **u8) -> int { green::start(argc, argv, main) }\n\nThe 'rustuv' is critical to prevent an early crash calling \"`Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value, but it limits the output file size as above.\n\nFrom talking with @huonw and @eddyb on IRC, this appears to be an issue with libuv.  eddyb pinpointed it to:\n\n  https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/librustuv/uvll.rs#L371-L384\n\nthe issue appears to be a mismatch in the type given and taken to/by libuv.\n\n@eddyb pinged the libuv folks, who said this aspect has recently changed and Rust should upgrade before working around the current code.  `uv_fs_write` apparently takes an _array_ of buffers now, in particular.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13130/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13130/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
