Either auto-complete can be active by default (where it will pop-up completions as you type) \n2. or, if that's not preferred, auto-complete functionality should be bound to some fairly common key (\"Tab\", or \"M-/\" are the most common choices from what I'm aware of) that enables completion when the cursor is in the middle of some typed text (e.g. http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/manual.html#Trigger_Key).\n\nFor more advanced completion stuff, is there a canonical set of places that could be searched for symbols to be completed?  I searched and found this: http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1xfjo7/ide_support/.  Is there a plan for this kind of support?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20509/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20509/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
