They should at least be mentioned there.\n\nIt would be good to also add  a little more info here: http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html#copy-types Maybe give some examples like in my question on stackoverflow:\n\n> The following two snippets of code only compile because `i32` and `bool` types both implement the copy trait.
