Without going into too much detail, a good resource to see the different ways can be found [here](https://mgattozzi.github.io/2016/05/26/how-do-i-str-string.html). Now, some of these methods, like `push_str`, `format!`, and `into` make sense, as they extend far beyond the scope of just converting a `&str` to a `String`. However, `to_string()`, `to_owned()`, and `String::from` do not. This is, what I consider to be, code bloat, which is a massive problem in languages like **C++**. Since **Rust** is such a young language, there is a big opportunity for this to be avoided.\r\n\r\nI suggest, since those later three functions do they same thing, that two of them be eliminated. As for which ones should be removed, that is for someone much smarter than me to decided. I will say, though, that both `to_string()` and `String::from` are both more descriptive than `to_owned()`. If removing functions is not possible, or considered bad practice, maybe consider declaring which method is idiomatic.\r\n\r\nSorry if this sounds aggressive! I just love this language, and I would hate to see it fall into the same pits as older, non-modern, languages.", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40762/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40762/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
