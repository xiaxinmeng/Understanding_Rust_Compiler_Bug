It'll will require a few changes though. Currently, the `unstable` attribute looks like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[unstable(feature = \"some_feature\", reason = \"some reason\", issue = \"123\")]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo here is what I suggest:\r\n\r\n * Enforce `feature` only for `rustc`.\r\n * Force `issue` to have a full URL outside of `rustc` (maybe even inside?).\r\n * Keep `reason`, I think it's fine to have a reason.\r\n\r\nOnce this done, `rustdoc` would also need to make some updates:\r\n\r\n* If `unstable` is used on a module, all its children (and children of its children recursively) should say that a parent is unstable and therefore this item is unstable too (which is message like `a parent of _child_ is unstable, therefore _child_ is unstable too`). This message should be put at the top of the item page and not repeated on any of the element of the page to prevent adding unnecessary noise.\r\n* If both a parent and the item are unstable, only display the message of the item.\r\n* If two parents are unstable, only print message of the closest one.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\ncc @rust-lang/compiler @rust-lang/rustdoc @RDambrosio016", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79663/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 3, "-1": 1, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79663/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
