When RUST_DEBUG is defined we do assertions about lock ownership and not much else. RUST_NDEBUG is defined by default, not RUST_DEBUG.\n\nLet's make greater use of this by disabling expensive assertions and enabling optimizations. Because this involves disabling a lot of very checks we'll have RUST_DEBUG on by default.\n\n**Without RUST_DEBUG we can**\n- Run the box annihilator on normal task exit without worrying about obscuring cycle collector errors\n- Turn off valgrind hints on stack allocation and switching paths that have real overhead\n- Turn off check_stack_canary\n- Turn off other expensive asserts\n\n**By default (with RUST_DEBUG) you get**\n- More locking assertions\n- More calls to check_stack_canary\n- More expensive asserts on the stack switching fast paths\n\nMost likely this will involve changing the configure script too. Instead of --enable-debug we would have --disable-debug. Since this should end up with a noticeable performance difference between the two, `configure` and/or `make all` and `make check` might want to mention it, perhaps even in a handsome ascii-art box.\n\n> Notes \n> - Make sure to measure each to make sure it's worth doing\n> - Some of these performance issues are also addressed by #2521\n> - The box annihilator needs additional performance work\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2589/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2589/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
