`half_open_range_patterns_in_slices`\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for the feature gate `#![feature(half_open_range_patterns)]`. This feature provides half-open range patterns `X..`, `..X`, `..=X`, and `...X` (last one is also deprecated like `X...Y` is, for spec & implementation simplicity). These correspond to the `RangeFrom`, `RangeTo`, `RangeToInclusive`, and `RangeToInclusive` expression forms, with the same syntaxes, respectively. The correspondence is both syntactic and semantic (in the sense that e.g. a `X..` pattern matching on a scrutinee `s` holds exactly when `(X..).contains(&s)` holds). For implementations details, see #67258.\r\n\r\nThe implementation for the feature was introduced in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67258 and is also strongly related to `#![feature(exclusive_range_pattern)]` (`X..Y`) which is also required for `X..` and `..X` (as the `RangeEnd::Exclusive` syntax is used).\r\n\r\n**Steps:**\r\n\r\n- Once `half_open_range_patterns` have had some time to bake on nightly, write up an RFC specifying both `exclusive_range_pattern` and `half_open_range` and proposing their stabilization.\r\n\r\n**Unresolved questions:**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Possibly rethink the precedences, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48501. We could ship without fixing this and leaving in the ambiguity errors.\r\n- [ ] The primary question to resolve is whether the lack of clarity around `..X` for signed types being from -i32::MAX -- is that OK?
