I would like to go one further: group all items according to stability, rather than just having them scattered through an alphabetic list. After grouping by stability, I would like each of the four sections to be ordered as follows:\n1. Stable\n2. Unstable\n3. Experimental\n4. Deprecated\n\nWithin each group, ordering will remain alphabetical.\n\nReasoning: if I'm a user, I want to prefer stable items, which means that I want to see at a glance what my stable options are. If there are no stable options, then I want to consider unstable options, then experimental options, then deprecated options, in that order. Furthermore, if I'm a library author, then I want my users to consider options in the same order: stable first, then unstable-but-up-and-coming, then deprecated last.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15345/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15345/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
