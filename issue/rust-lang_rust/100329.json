I have never experienced such an issue before and am not sure what causes it, but it seems like other cargo tools (like build, test or check) don't exhibit such a behavior.\r\n\r\nBasically, cargo clippy issues lots of errors like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nerror[E0514]: found crate `http` compiled by an incompatible version of rustc\r\n   --> src/handshake/client.rs:263:35\r\n    |\r\n263 |         *response.version_mut() = http::Version::HTTP_11;\r\n    |                                   ^^^^\r\n    |\r\n    = help: please recompile that crate using this compiler (rustc 1.64.0-nightly (4493a0f47 2022-08-02)) (consider running `cargo clean` first)\r\n    = note: the following crate versions were found:\r\n            crate `http` compiled by rustc 1.62.1: /Users/danielabramov/Development/Temporary/tungstenite-rs/target/debug/deps/libhttp-7678c1c40ba01260.rmeta\r\n\r\nerror[E0514]: found crate `rand` compiled by an incompatible version of rustc\r\n   --> src/handshake/client.rs:273:23\r\n    |\r\n273 |     let r: [u8; 16] = rand::random();\r\n    |                       ^^^^\r\n    |\r\n    = help: please recompile that crate using this compiler (rustc 1.64.0-nightly (4493a0f47 2022-08-02)) (consider running `cargo clean` first)\r\n    = note: the following crate versions were found:\r\n            crate `rand` compiled by rustc 1.62.1: /Users/danielabramov/Development/Temporary/tungstenite-rs/target/debug/deps/librand-150c29d9d94e1b71.rmeta\r\n\r\nerror[E0514]: found crate `base64` compiled by an incompatible version of rustc\r\n   --> src/handshake/client.rs:274:5\r\n    |\r\n274 |     base64::encode(&r)\r\n    |     ^^^^^^\r\n    |\r\n    = help: please recompile that crate using this compiler (rustc 1.64.0-nightly (4493a0f47 2022-08-02)) (consider running `cargo clean` first)\r\n    = note: the following crate versions were found:\r\n            crate `base64` compiled by rustc 1.62.1: /Users/danielabramov/Development/Temporary/tungstenite-rs/target/debug/deps/libbase64-211df52e54c0b018.rmeta\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the version of the compiler it suggests to use does actually match the version with which the crate was built, which confuses me. I've also tried it with `rustc 1.65.0-nightly` and the issue remains.\r\n\r\nThe issue only happens on M1 Macbook so far and works fine on a regular Intel Macbook as well as on Linux/PC, so I wonder if it's a target-dependent issue.\r\n\r\nInitially I've created a bug [in `clippy` repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/9286). However, it was suggested, that the issue might be related to `rustc` or to the way `clippy` is interacting with `rustc`.\r\n\r\nApologies if I'm missing something and posted the issue in a wrong repository.\r\n\r\n### Reproduce\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:snapview/tungstenite-rs.git\r\n$ cd tungstenite-rs\r\n$ cargo clippy\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ rustc --version --verbose\r\nrustc 1.62.1\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: unknown\r\ncommit-date: unknown\r\nhost: aarch64-apple-darwin\r\nrelease: 1.62.1\r\nLLVM version: 14.0.5\r\n```", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100329/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100329/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
