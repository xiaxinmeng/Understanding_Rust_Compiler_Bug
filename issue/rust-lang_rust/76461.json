For example, in the example provided in the error explanation, the value assigned to `x` is most definitely `&str`, and `i32` is expected, so the types don't match.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@rustbot modify labels: A-diagnostics D-incorrect D-confusing C-bug", "closed_by": {"login": "camelid", "id": 37223377, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjIzMzc3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37223377?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid", "html_url": "https://github.com/camelid", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76461/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76461/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
