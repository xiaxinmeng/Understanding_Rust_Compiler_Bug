In C (and glibc) there is transparent function & syscall replacement if program is compiled with `-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64`.\r\nExample list of functions that should not be  used and replaced with their 64-bit versions if LFS is enabled: `fallocate fcntl fopen fstat fstatfs ftruncate getrlimit glob globfree lseek lstat mkstemp mmap open openat posix_fadvise posix_fallocate pread pwrite readdir setrlimit stat statfs`. For example, instead of `openat` should be used `openat64`.\r\n\r\nThere are related issues:\r\n* https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31668\r\n* https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31805\r\n\r\nBut their solutions are seems incomplete.\r\n\r\nSimplest reproducer:\r\n```\r\n$ cat main.rs\r\nfn main() {}\r\n$ rustc main.rs\r\n$ nm main |grep 'U open'\r\n         U open64@GLIBC_2.1\r\n         U open@GLIBC_2.0\r\n```\r\nAs you can see there is `open` present which mean that there is still non-LFS compliant usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94173/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94173/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
