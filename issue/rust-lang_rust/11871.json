These libraries _do not_ have the segmented stack preludes. The libraries _may_ have been built with GCC using `-fcheck-stack`.\n\nAt the moment, Rust is unable to build a binary without the dependency on segmented stacks. Rust installs neither `llc` or `clang`, so it provides no way to compile a freestanding binary at all. Using `llc` is not ideal since it uses a weird optimization stack, and `clang` isn't built _at all_ (clang 3.3 or 3.4 are not defined to work on the bytecode from trunk).\n#10781 covers provide full stack safety via a guard page with the assumption that libraries are compiled with `-fcheck-stack` or do not have large uninitialized stack frames. However, there really needs to be a way to disable this now as it prevents using `rustc` to compile any freestanding/runtimeless code.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11871/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11871/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
