That way the public docs change less when crate-internal reorganization happens.\r\n\r\nObviously impl blocks with differing generic bounds wouldn't be mergable (eg: `impl Foo<u8>` vs `impl<T> Foo<T>`), just when the bounds match.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82408/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82408/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
