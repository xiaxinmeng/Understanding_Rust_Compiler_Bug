Turns out this builds on nightly but not on stable.\r\n\r\nMore precisely: https://github.com/Txuritan/tie is the reproducer, it builds fine any rustc built after 9b2b8a5afa833795b66267684615497c9547878d, but fails on anything before that, including stable, with the following error:\r\n```\r\nerror: couldn't read src/text.txt: No such file or directory (os error 2)\r\n --> src/lib.rs:1:1\r\n  |\r\n1 | / mod example;\r\n2 | |\r\n3 | | #[async_trait::async_trait]\r\n4 | | pub trait Test {\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to my nonexistent git-bisect skills, \"9b2b8a5afa833795b66267684615497c9547878d is the first bad commit\" (where bad is actually good here, it means the crate compiles). So it look like it's some broken span reporting/propagation that was fixed in master since. That's about everything I know, but knowing the precise commit narrow things down a fair bit, I believe.\r\n\r\nHope this can help !", "closed_by": {"login": "nightmared", "id": 7265382, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcyNjUzODI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7265382?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nightmared", "html_url": "https://github.com/nightmared", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nightmared/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nightmared/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nightmared/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nightmared/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nightmared/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nightmared/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nightmared/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nightmared/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nightmared/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73551/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73551/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
