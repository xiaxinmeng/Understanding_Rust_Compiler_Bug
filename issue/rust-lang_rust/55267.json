Could the compiler do a better job keeping method chains alive until the end of the scope? Perhaps create some variable bindings behind the scenes, on behalf of the developer.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55267/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55267/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
