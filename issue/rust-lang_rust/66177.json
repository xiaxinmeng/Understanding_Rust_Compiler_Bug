Specifically, using WASM in a stack-based Virtual Machine as apposed to a runtime environment (i.e. Lucet etc). A question being, what are the bare minimum standards which both wasm32-wasi and WAVM can both implement to enable Rust programmers to execute their code on WAVM?\r\n \r\nThank you\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "tpmccallum", "id": 9831342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzEzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9831342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpmccallum", "html_url": "https://github.com/tpmccallum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpmccallum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpmccallum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpmccallum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpmccallum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpmccallum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpmccallum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpmccallum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpmccallum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpmccallum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66177/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66177/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
