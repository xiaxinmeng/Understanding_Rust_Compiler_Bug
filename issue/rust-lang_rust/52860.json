The way I see it is that the new suggested crate system regarding paths is essentially equivalent to the old syntax, with the only difference being that you no longer need to use the extern keyword, and things are more accessible rather than needing to use them explicitly in submodules they are essentially implicitly imported everywhere. \r\n\r\nThe only other addition seems to be that you start the crate root with crate:: rather than ::. I prefer starting it with just ::, as this is consistent with the way I originally learned it, however I can see people who haven't learned the module system yet finding starting it with crate:: more intuitive. Why not allow for both syntax forms? Is there some reason that makes it infeasible to have both of them? If both can be supported I thoroughly endorse supporting both of them. If only one can be supported, I am inclined more so toward :: just as it is what I've become accustomed to, though it may be easier for newbies to learn it as crate:: and I can trivially update my understanding of it to be such, so perhaps my motivation is selfish. \r\n\r\nSo essentially, I ultimately don't really care, but I personally prefer ::, but I think supporting both would be ideal, though if one must be selected and people think that starting it with crate:: is superior for newbies then I don't object to this.
