The former can be done precisely; the latter will probably have to be done heuristically with some sort of watchdog thread. This maybe should be two different bugs.\n\nThe former will work with 2 global reference counts - one which tracks the number of non-sleeping schedulers, and one which tracks the number of tasks blocked on I/O. When the last scheduler goes to sleep, if the I/O-blocking refcount is zero, it means all tasks are either exited or blocked on pipes. If the latter, the runtime should emit a \"your tasks deadlocked and now the process is hanging\" message and exit. This will build on the refcounts we'll probably use for #7702.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7889/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7889/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
