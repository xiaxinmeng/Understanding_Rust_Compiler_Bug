However, inside the pattern it has type `u32`. The fact that these types do not align is confusing, as it means you can't dereference `y` inside the pattern like this:\r\n```rust\r\nfn foo(x: &S) {\r\n    let _: u32 = match x {\r\n        S(&y) => y,\r\n        _ => 0,\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand instead have to dereference it outside the pattern:\r\n```rust\r\nfn foo(x: &S) {\r\n    let _: u32 = match x {\r\n        S(y) => *y,\r\n        _ => 0,\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIs there any reason this was chosen to be the case, or is required to be the case? As it stands, this behaviour is very counter-intuitive.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/64586/reactions", "total_count": 15, "+1": 8, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 7, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/64586/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
