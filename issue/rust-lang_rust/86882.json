The current behavior is that I have to either click on the option I want with my mouse, or click into the search bar before I'm able to then use the arrow keys / `Enter` to get to my option.\r\n\r\nIs it a possibility to make it so that when a search query page is directly navigated to, it can allow you to immediately interact with the search results via keyboard? Obviously we wouldn't want to steal input focus away from a user who is still typing their query in however, so that's an important distinction.\r\n\r\nI'm also happy to have a go at implementing this feature myself, assuming this is something that people are happy to see integrated.\r\n\r\nCheers!", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86882/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86882/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
