However, we are doing more work than we need to do. This part of the inference engine processes outlives constraints like `'a: 'b`, which says that the region `'a` outlives `'b` and therefore should be a superset of the points in `'b`. To process such a constraint we therefore take all the points in `'b` and add them to `'a`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/2808460e0f8082ac2724c9809d27990ca9cfefd8/src/librustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/region_infer/values.rs#L246-L250\r\n\r\nYou can see therefore that a constraint like `'a: 'a` is pretty uninteresting. It is also uninterested to have two of the *same* constraints (`'b: 'c`, `'b: 'c`), since processing the first one will also solve the second one.\r\n\r\nHowever, a cursory examination of the constraints from many examples reveals that we have both a lot of duplicates *and* a lot of `X: X` identity constraints.  I find about ~30% of the constraints are duplicated.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason for this is that, in the original NLL proposal and in Polonius, we distinguished not only `'a: 'b` but also the location where it occurs (`'a: 'b @ P`). We are no longer using this `P` information so it would be good to discard it (and the next gen region inference engine, polonius, uses a different data structures for its constraints anyway). (Interestingly, *even if* we take the location `P` into account, it is still true that most of the constraints are duplicated, so there is likely a win here waiting for polonius as well at some future point.) \r\n\r\nThe constraints in question are instances of this struct:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/2808460e0f8082ac2724c9809d27990ca9cfefd8/src/librustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/region_infer/mod.rs#L120-L146\r\n\r\nThey are stored in a vector here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/2808460e0f8082ac2724c9809d27990ca9cfefd8/src/librustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/region_infer/mod.rs#L70-L71\r\n\r\nMost elements of this vector I believe are given in `RegionInferenceContext::new`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/2808460e0f8082ac2724c9809d27990ca9cfefd8/src/librustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/region_infer/mod.rs#L272\r\n\r\nbut some are later added via `add_outlives`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/2808460e0f8082ac2724c9809d27990ca9cfefd8/src/librustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/region_infer/mod.rs#L390-L407\r\n\r\nThe initial vector is populated by the MIR type check in this call here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/7008a953ebb0114ceeb16f4a08177dc7c92c5d42/src/librustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/type_check/mod.rs#L759-L768\r\n\r\nSo to solve this problem we would want to detect duplicates somehow, probably taking just sub+sup into account. The only reason to also include the location is that it *may* be useful in reporting errors later. It probably makes sense to do this by adding a `FxHashSet<(RegionVid, RegionVid)>` to detect duplicates, though it might make sense to extract the vector itself from both the `RegionInferenceContext` and the MIR type check into a common data structure (`OutlivesConstraintSet` or something) that keeps the `FxHashSet` and the `Vec` in one.", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51821/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51821/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
