does make some attempt to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/bootstrap/bin/rustc.rs#L93) however this is not affecting the `build-script-build` stuff apparently.\r\n\r\nThis is also causing `--no-fail env` to be ineffective for this case, presumably because `build-script-build` also bypasses rustbuild's `rustc.rs` wrapper (which is the only place that actually does anything in reaction to `--no-fail`.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43289/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0,
