This flag was to be insta-stable because it is needed, e.g. to help profilers like `perf` that need to reconstruct the stack. @dotdash then came back with a [few proposed changes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47152#issuecomment-364910622). Unfortunately, they were never able to finalize the rebase, and the PR was closed by triage for inactivity. This is where **you** come in, dear reader! Perhaps you can help us!\r\n\r\nThere was some dispute about what the final interface ought to be though. @dotdash proposed `-Comit-frame-pointer=[yes|no]`, but @Mark-Simulacrum [proposed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47152#issuecomment-365140301) `-Cframe-pointers=[auto, yes, no]`, which seems logical enough. \r\n\r\nHowever we say it, the default behavior (when user says nothing) probably wants to be:\r\n\r\n- If debuginfo is enabled, keep them.\r\n- If not optimizing, keep them.\r\n- Follow behavior of either gcc or clang:\r\n    - GCC has the -fomit-frame-pointer option, default off on \"32-bit GNU/Linux x86 and 32-bit Darwin x86 targets\", but otherwise on it seems if optimizing. \r\n    - [clang always retains frame pointers on darwin by default](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47152#issuecomment-364987321)\r\n    - [cl.exe will always keep frame pointers by default for unoptimized builds](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47152#issuecomment-365145882)\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "sfackler", "id": 1455697, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTU2OTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1455697?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler", "html_url": "https://github.com/sfackler", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48785/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48785/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
