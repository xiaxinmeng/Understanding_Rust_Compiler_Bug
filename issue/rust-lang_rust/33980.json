I've just received reams of errors from as far as `libsyntax` that, I suspect, must come from incompatible rustc used. A few examples, just to make sure it's no longer  #usable:\n\n``` rust\n\nsrc/libsyntax/ext/quote.rs:597:64: 597:91 error: failed to resolve.

Preferably, an error message could be printed immediately on rustc version check.\n\nAdditonally, if a full llvm build is done first, a scenario like that won't lead to lots of wasted time, in case the rustc used (even the official download) is incompatible or crashing (e.g. SIGILL, SIGSEGV):\n#33928\n#33483\n", "closed_by": {"login": "MagaTailor", "id": 12054457, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU0NDU3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12054457?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/MagaTailor", "html_url": "https://github.com/MagaTailor", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MagaTailor/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MagaTailor/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MagaTailor/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MagaTailor/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MagaTailor/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MagaTailor/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MagaTailor/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MagaTailor/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MagaTailor/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33980/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33980/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
