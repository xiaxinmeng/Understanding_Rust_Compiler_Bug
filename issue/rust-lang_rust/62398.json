Unfortunately, this allows *all* deprecated items, so by the time someone gets around to fix that, other uses of deprecated items could have crept in.\r\n\r\nIt would be much better if that could be `allow(deprecated(mem::uninitialized))` or so, to *only* allow the one method without also allowing everything else.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to `deprecated_in_future`.\r\n\r\nI think I saw @Mark-Simulacrum ask for this somewhere recently?
