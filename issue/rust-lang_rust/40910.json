We have a mock version of the same scheduler which doesn't use real time but has the same API, and uses `Instant` internally (simply because converting between `Instant` and `Duration` is convenient and gives us mock code closer to the real code). Since the only way of constructing an `Instant` at the moment is `Instant::now()`, we currently store a \"start time\" when constructing the scheduler and compare all times to that; this would be simpler if we could simply use zero.", "closed_by": {"login": "dhardy", "id": 134893, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy", "html_url": "https://github.com/dhardy", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40910/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 4, "-1": 1, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40910/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
