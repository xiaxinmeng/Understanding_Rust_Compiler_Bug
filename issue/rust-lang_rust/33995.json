This may be reasonable for foreign functions though, because such functions may follow foreign naming conventions. If this lint is \"fixed\" it may affects crates like `winapi` (cc @retep998). This is not so reasonable for trait methods however.\n\nExamples:\n\n``` rust\n#![allow(dead_code, unused_variables)]\n\nconst SOD: u8 = 0;\nconst SOB: u8 = 0;\nconst MOD: u8 = 0;\nconst MDC: u8 = 0;\nconst DRI: u8 = 0;\n\n// warning: variable `SOD` should have a snake case name\n// error: let variables cannot be named the same as const variables\nfn f(SOD: u8) {}\n\ntrait Tr {\n    // warning: variable `SOB` should have a snake case name\n    // error: let variables cannot be named the same as const variables\n    fn g(SOB: u8) {}\n\n    // No warnings, no errors\n    fn h(MOD: u8);\n}\n\n// No warnings, no errors\ntype A = fn(MDC: u8);\n\nextern \"C\" {\n    // No warnings, no errors\n    fn k(DRI: u8);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n}\n```\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33995/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33995/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
