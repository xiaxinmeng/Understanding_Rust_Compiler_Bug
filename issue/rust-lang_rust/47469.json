This invocation ends up with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` containing both \"stage1/lib/\" (built by stage0) and \"stage1/lib/rustlib/$target/lib/\" (built by stage1).\r\n\r\nIn the non-`local_rebuild` case, this works fine, because those two paths will have librustc_driver-HASH.so with different hash suffixes, as they were built by different versions of rustc.\r\n\r\nWith `local_rebuild` they get the same suffix, and since stage1/lib is first in the path, `rustdoc` is loaded with that.  But the symbols *within* the libraries have different hash names, so the dynamic loader fails to find the exact `...add_configuration17hf4e36c9e237094ebE` symbol.\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's expected that their symbol names are different, even when the compiler version is the same.  A workaround is to use `--enable-full-bootstrap` so `force_use_stage1()` returns false.\r\n\r\nxref: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1533848\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "cuviper", "id": 36186, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36186?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper", "html_url": "https://github.com/cuviper", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47469/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47469/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
