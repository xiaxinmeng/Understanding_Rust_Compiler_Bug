For example, `(0..100_000).chain(0..100_000).nth(50_000)` has O(n) performance, even though it never reaches the second iterator.\r\n\r\nI don't really know if this is worth fixing, but if it is, a way to fix it could be to add a method similar to `nth` to `Iterator` that returns `Result<Self::Item, usize>`. The `Err` case represents the \"remaining\" `n` (there's probably a better way to phrase that).\r\n\r\nI don't have any interesting benchmarks, but I can confirm that implementing what I've temporarily called `try_nth` for `ops::Range` and `iter::Chain` makes `(0..100_000).chain(0..100_000).nth(50_000)` run in constant time. So returning `Result<Self::Item, usize>` indeed composes better. But again, this may not be worth fixing. \ud83d\ude42", "closed_by": {"login": "timvermeulen", "id": 2904179, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDQxNzk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2904179?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/timvermeulen", "html_url": "https://github.com/timvermeulen", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timvermeulen/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timvermeulen/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timvermeulen/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timvermeulen/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timvermeulen/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timvermeulen/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timvermeulen/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timvermeulen/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timvermeulen/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60395/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60395/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
