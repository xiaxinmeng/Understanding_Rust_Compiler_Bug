This is a feature request that also seems too small for an RFC. The contrib guidelines are not too clear what to do here, so I hope I'm doing this right._\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57391 there's been conversation about making it easier to construct new `time::Duration`s by using constants:\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::time;\r\n\r\nfutures_timer::wait_for(30 * time::SECS).await;\r\n``` \r\n\r\nWhile writing code today I was wondering about easier ways to create `Instant`s. Specifically creating a timestamp that evaluates to _now_ would be useful. As it could be combined with the constants to create an `Instant` at a particular point in the future.\r\n\r\nThis is why I would like to propose the addition of a `time::now` function that would be equivalent to `time::Instant::now`. The result would be for most programs only the top-level `std::time` module needs to be imported, and lines dealing with time-related code would be fewer to express the same results.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n_Adapted from [the `time::Instant` docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.Instant.html#method.now)._\r\n### Proposed\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::{time, thread};\r\n\r\nlet now = time::now();\r\nthread::sleep(2 * time::SECS);\r\nprintln!(\"{}\", now.elapsed().as_secs());\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::time::{Duration, Instant};\r\nuse std::thread::sleep;\r\n\r\nlet now = Instant::now();\r\nsleep(Duration::from_secs(2));\r\nprintln!(\"{}\", now.elapsed().as_secs());\r\n```\r\n\r\n_edit: I've written a post on this: https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/std-time/_", "closed_by": {"login": "yoshuawuyts", "id": 2467194, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjcxOTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2467194?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts", "html_url": "https://github.com/yoshuawuyts", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62114/reactions", "total_count": 12, "+1": 3, "-1": 2, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 7, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62114/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
