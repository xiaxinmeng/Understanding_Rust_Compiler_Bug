That is -- there are no 'self tests' to make sure that it's acting as it should, invoking revisions the way we expect, and so forth. This could be a bit of a tricky thing to do, but it's definitely worth the effort.\r\n\r\nFor example, an early version of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47605 had a subtle bug where it *appeared* to be working, but in fact was not passing the revision info through to the final test. I don't think this would have bothered travis one bit, as that would have happily run the same revision over and over.\r\n\r\ncc @spastorino @oli-obk ... we need like a compiletest team, don't why? :)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47606/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47606/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
