The operation should involve reading a .json file with the last run values, comparing to current-run values, failing if any regress, and rewriting the file if any advanced. Buildbot can potentially deposit the .json file before each build if it's missing, and harvest it after for display / plotting, and users can just work with the one(s) in their own workspaces.\n\nThis requires either objective performance criteria or fuzzy forms of comparison. Prefer objective when possible. `valgrind --tool=lackey` and `perf stat` can gather number of instructions retired, which tends to be much _more_ stable than clock time.\n\nProbably easier to base this on metrics gathered from #6810\n", "closed_by": {"login": "aturon", "id": 709807, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTgwNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/709807?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon", "html_url": "https://github.com/aturon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7459/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7459/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
