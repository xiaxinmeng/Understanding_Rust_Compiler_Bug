Implementing them overloads the == and != operators.\r\n> * [Ord] and [PartialOrd] are traits that allow you to define total and partial orderings between values, respectively. Implementing them overloads the <, <=, >, and >= operators.\r\n> * [Ordering][cmp::Ordering] is an enum returned by the main functions of [Ord] and [PartialOrd], and describes an ordering.\r\n> * [Reverse][cmp::Reverse] is a struct that allows you to easily reverse an ordering.\r\n> * [max][cmp::max] and [min][cmp::min] are functions that build off of [Ord] and allow you to find the maximum or minimum of two values.\r\n\r\nIt seems that there are just a few links that are broken, so I thought I'd just make an issue. I would submit a PR with the fix, but I'm not sure how to do these kinds links.
