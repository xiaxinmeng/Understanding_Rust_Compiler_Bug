In particular, we clarify that the pointer must be non-NULL and aligned *even when the access has size 0*.\r\n\r\nThis issue is about helping people find bugs in libstd by adding a `debug_assert!` to all these methods testing that condition, similar to what I did [for from_raw_parts](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/52972). I suggest to add a helper method to raw pointers to test this, and also use that for `from_raw_parts` and `from_raw_parts_mut`.\r\n\r\nThis may uncover issues in libstd, uncovering misuses of these methods.
