I remember that I saw the following pattern a few times in the standard library, though it seems to be less common:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait A {}\r\ntrait B {}\r\nstruct C;\r\n\r\nimpl A for C where C: B {} // Note: does not compile, as `C` does not implement `B`\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt might be useful to mention (possibly in an example, e.g. in the section starting with \"where can also be used to express more complicated constraints\") a case where we the `TYPE` of the `BOUND` is a `struct` instead of a generic type. For me, being quite new to Rust, it was non-trivial to discover that this was possible.\r\n\r\nIf this is something you would consider lifting from the RFC to the documentation, I could work on this.", "closed_by": {"login": "bastbu", "id": 22341213, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzQxMjEz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22341213?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bastbu", "html_url": "https://github.com/bastbu", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bastbu/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bastbu/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bastbu/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bastbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bastbu/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bastbu/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bastbu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bastbu/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bastbu/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/101795/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/101795/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
