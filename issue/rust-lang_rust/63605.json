Up to 1.36, it used to be of the form `rust-src-1.36.0.tar.gz` (adjusting for the version, of course).  This broke some automation scripts I have, but ok - no big deal really.\r\n\r\nThe larger issue is there's no `install.sh` in there anymore.  I have some scripts that vendor the Rust toolchain, and they're expecting to find that shell script in there to install the `rust-src` component.  What's the new mechanism to accomplish that?\r\n\r\nI couldn't find any reference to this change in the 1.37 release notes, but perhaps I didn't look hard enough (to my credit, I did try a few quick github repo searches but to no avail).\r\n\r\nHappy to answer any questions or provide more info.\r\n\r\nThanks", "closed_by": {"login": "vitalyd", "id": 549403, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTQwMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/549403?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitalyd", "html_url": "https://github.com/vitalyd", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitalyd/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitalyd/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitalyd/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitalyd/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitalyd/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitalyd/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitalyd/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitalyd/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vitalyd/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63605/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63605/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
