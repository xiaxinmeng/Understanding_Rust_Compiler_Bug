As of 1.22, panic columns are reported starting with 0.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\npanic!(\"line 2 column 0\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExcept panics that originate within the compiler which seem to start with 1, at least in the following case.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\nlet mut array = [];\r\narray[7] = \"line 3 column 1\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor #46762 we decided to at least make all panics consistent and go with 1 based. Discussed with the libs team today and we would be interested in applying the same fix for the `column!()` macro as well. Currently the first `line!()` is 1 and the first `column!()` is 0. This seems like an oversight. We would like to make `column!()` return 1 in the first column. This matches how panics report the column as of #46762, and matches how most text editors number columns.\r\n\r\nObviously if this change turns out to cause major problems then we would revisit, but `column!()` is used infrequently enough and its uses tend to be such that off-by-one is not important (pretty much limited to error reporting) so we are not too worried.\r\n\r\nDocumentation for both [`line!()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.line.html) and [`column!()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.column.html) will need to be updated to be explicit about the numbering.\r\n\r\n@est31 would you be interested in tackling this change?", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46868/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46868/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
