Here's a simple example:\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let v = Vec::<(i32, f32)>::with_capacity(2);\n    v.push((1, 2.5));\n    v.push((2, 7.0));\n    for (a, b) in v.iter() {\n        println!(\"a: {}  b: {}\", a, b);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis fails to compile with the message:\n\n```\nvectuple.rs:5:2: 8:2 error: type mismatch resolving `<core::slice::Iter<'_, (i32, f32)> as core::iter::Iterator>::Item == (_, _)`:\n expected &-ptr,\n    found tuple [E0271]\nvectuple.rs:5   for (a, b) in v.iter() {\n```\n\nIt seems like rustc knows that the vector has an int+float tuple, but I don't really understand the error...\n", "closed_by": {"login": "sqweek", "id": 1590301, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTAzMDE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1590301?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sqweek", "html_url": "https://github.com/sqweek", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sqweek/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sqweek/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sqweek/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sqweek/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sqweek/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sqweek/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sqweek/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sqweek/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sqweek/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22576/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22576/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
