People who are coming to Rust may be surprised to see, that it doesn't work the intended way. There's no warning whatsoever, just a clippy lint:\r\n```text\r\nwarning: this let-binding has unit value\r\n --> src/main.rs:2:5\r\n  |\r\n2 |     let a;\r\n  |     ^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nI managed to implement this:\r\n```text\r\nwarning: chaining assignment is not supported in Rust\r\n --> a.rs:4:5\r\n  |\r\n4 |     a = b = 3;\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^\r\n  |\r\n  = note: `#[warn(chained_assignment)]` on by default\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I have a few questions:\r\nWhat does the user actually want?\r\nDoes he want\r\n  1 `a = 3; b = 3`\r\n  2 `a = b == 3`\r\n\r\nThe first one only works if the value is `Copy` for obvious reasons.\r\nThe second one only works if the value implements `PartialEq`.\r\n\r\nI would like to see this in the Rust compiler, what do you think? What is missing? Am I overlooking something? Is everything covered? Would it brake any existing code?\r\n\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63556/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63556/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
