Since the regression has persisted through the last half dozen perf runs, it is likely not spurious. There are no outstanding perf runs near the regression (2020-03-02), so I am fairly confident in this attribution. That rollup consists of the following PRs:\r\n\r\n - #68682 (Add documentation to compiler intrinsics)\r\n - #69544 (Unrevert \"Remove `checked_add` in `Layout::repeat`\")\r\n - #69617 (constify mem::forget)\r\n - #69622 (Rename `syntax` in librustc_ast/README.md)\r\n - #69623 (stash API: remove panic to fix ICE.)\r\n - #69624 (Toolstate: Don't block beta week on already broken tools.)\r\n\r\nI would not expect any of them to negatively impact performance, although I did do a perf run with an `unchecked_add` in `Layout::repeat` to no avail (see #69679). The regression is only noticeable in clean/patched incremental builds, so I don't think this is high priority, but it would be nice to know what's going on here.\r\n\r\ncc @nnethercote @jonas-schievink @Mark-Simulacrum \r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikic", "id": 216080, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjA4MA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216080?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69710/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69710/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
