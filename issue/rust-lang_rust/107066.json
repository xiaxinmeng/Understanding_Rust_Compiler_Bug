I was wondering whether it would be agreeable to support a certain edge case formatting for doc comments as follows:\r\n\r\nIn the codebases I write, I like to do this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"663\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-18 at 2 45 13 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92199902/213112998-cca5abbc-e617-4789-bd5a-ea496931b2bf.png\">\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I am referring to the left margin vertical pipe.\r\n\r\n/**\r\n |   doc comment body\r\n |\r\n | \r\n */\r\n\r\nI do this because I think it is a bit easier to read, and because, to me, it looks better in my editor.\r\n\r\nI find that the left margin pipe character `|` lets my eyes lock in on doc comments more easily when I encounter them in the code.\r\n\r\nAnyway, most of my codebases look like this.  I like to be able to use this particular formatting when I write code.\r\n\r\nI am reluctant to change these usages, though I find they complicate the automatic documentation generated into docs.rs.  \r\n\r\nWhat happens on docs.rs is that, without a special case, these pipe characters get interspersed with the actual documentation. \r\n\r\nI am wondering if, for example, it would be reasonable/agreeable for me/us to *special case* the formatting code which is involved in generating the documentation.\r\n\r\nWhat I am considering is that we can *check* whether the doc comment has this particular left margin all the way down.  If so, during the doc comment generation, we can *remove* the whole left margin pipe, leaving just the interior documentation comment as desired.\r\n\r\nI think it should probably not be too much of an issue, or cause any undesired behavior elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Is this straightforward? Would you accept a pull request for this, if I could figure out how to do it?\r\n\r\nIs there anything else I should consider? Perhaps, once implemented, there could be a way to activate this feature explicitly, so that it is not the default behavior.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "klebs6", "id": 92199902, "node_id": "U_kgDOBX7b3g", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92199902?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/klebs6", "html_url": "https://github.com/klebs6", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klebs6/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klebs6/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klebs6/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klebs6/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klebs6/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klebs6/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klebs6/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klebs6/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/klebs6/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/107066/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/107066/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
