I've heard reports of this happening on both Unix and Windows, so this is a cross-platform concern.\r\n\r\nMy preference of how to implement this would be:\r\n\r\n* Linkers typically support this method via passing arguments as `@file` where `file` is a path on the filesystem that contains a bunch of options.\r\n* Short linker invocations should not use `@file` syntax for debuggability\r\n* The compiler automatically switches to `@file` when the command line gets too big. \r\n* rustc has some arbitrary limit for bytes it'll pass as arguments to `Command`, likely well below the platform specific limits\r\n\r\nI don't know the precise syntax of these files, unfortunately, but I'm sure google does somewhere!", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/41190/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/41190/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
