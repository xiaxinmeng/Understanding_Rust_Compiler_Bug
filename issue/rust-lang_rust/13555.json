This is rather strange, since the current `ToBigInt` implementors do not fail at all ( `ToBigUint` does fail, but only because they are implemented for signed integers as well).\n\nGiven that `BigInt` and `BigUint` already implements `FromStr` (that would correspond to `impl<'a> ToBigInt for &'a str` and so on), it would be better to make them implemented only for types that would definitely convertible to the big integers without an error. More precisely:\n- Make `ToBigInt::to_bigint` and `ToBigUint::to_biguint` return `BigInt` and `BigUint` respectively.\n- Remove implementations of `ToBigUint` for signed integers and `BigInt`.\n- Add a new `into_biguint` (since it's more efficient, and does not confuse users of `ToBigUint`) to `BigInt`, which returns `Option<BigUint>`. We may also have `into_bigint` to `BigUint`, at expense of symmetry (it becomes asymmetric since it should _not_ return `Option<BigInt>`).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "rust-highfive", "id": 7378925, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjczNzg5MjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7378925?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-highfive", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13555/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13555/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
