We're currently looking at expanding aarch64 testing in CI, and not needing to special case Alpine aarch64 would be great.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to try to work up a PR for this, but there's one thing I'm not positive about: can this be a cross-compilation, the way `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` is (I know there's ongoing work to have aarch64 be tier1 with tests run natively).\r\n\r\nI've currently hacked up the dockerfiles to do this, but I'm only about 40% sure I did it correctly, so we'll see, assuming this idea is acceptable.", "closed_by": {"login": "alex", "id": 772, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/772?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alex", "html_url": "https://github.com/alex", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alex/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alex/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alex/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alex/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alex/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alex/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alex/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alex/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alex/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75721/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75721/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
