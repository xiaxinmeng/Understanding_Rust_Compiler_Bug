However, use of `todo!()` often leads to the `unreachable_code` warning since it panics and the subsequent is not executable.\r\n\r\nIt is currently possible to suppress this warning at the crate level, `#![allow(unreachable_code)]`, but this would result in suppressing legitimate unreachable code bugs as well. On the other hand, it is also possible to suppress this warning for each function that uses `todo!()`, but this introduces significantly more boilerplate (compare `#[allow(unreachable_code)]` 26 chars, need to move cursor to declaring block, vs `todo!()`, 7 chars in place).\r\n\r\nAccording to the docs for `todo!()`, \"`todo!` conveys an intent of implementing the functionality later\". This implies that the TODO itself is already implies the current code is meant to be somewhat incorrect, and it is unlikely that a developer writing code after `todo!()` does not know it is unreachable.\r\n\r\nHence, subsequent code after `todo!()` shall not be considered unreachable, and the compiler shall suppress such warnings that would not have happened without `todo!()`.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75277/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 2, "-1": 3, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75277/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
