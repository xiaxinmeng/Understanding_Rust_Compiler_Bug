However, when using an external LLVM build, it may not have all architectures available, so the test will fail despite anything Rust could do.  For example, on Fedora 24 I have:\n\n```\n$ llvm-config --targets-built\nX86 AMDGPU PowerPC NVPTX SystemZ AArch64 ARM BPF CppBackend\n```\n\nIn particular this doesn't have \"Mips\", so the `mips` and `mipsel` targets will fail in `atomic-lock-free`.  It would be nicer if this test only attempted architectures that are included in one's build of LLVM.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/35023/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/35023/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
