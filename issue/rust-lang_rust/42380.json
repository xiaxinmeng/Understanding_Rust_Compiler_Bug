Which does not reflect changes that have happened to the nightly compiler, even though they are advertising stdlib types that are only available in nightly (and thus may have diverged from the given documentation).\r\n\r\nThe url I *should* have wanted is:\r\n\r\n  https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ops/struct.RangeInclusive.html\r\n\r\nSo, my thought:\r\n\r\nShould features available solely in the nightly compiler either be filtered out from the stable docs, or, alternatively, should they include a link to the nightly docs?\r\n\r\n(Adding such a link automatically may be tricky in a case like this, where the embedded within the two urls is the distinction between whether `RangeInclusive` is an `enum` or `struct`. But maybe we would just implement this forward link within the `#[unstable]` attribute, where it could be manually adjusted to reflect such changes?)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n(Unfortunately, revising my google search to: \"rust nightly std::ops::RangeInclusive\" still has the same (stable docs) url as the first result; the nightly docs come up second there.)", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42380/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42380/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
