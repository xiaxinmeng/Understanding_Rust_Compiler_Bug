Unfortunately though this is a `cargo` crate from crates.io, which differs from the `src/tools/cargo` crate in-tree. This means that when we build the RLS it's linking against *two* optimized versions of Cargo, which not only takes up a good deal of space but also takes up a good deal of build time.\r\n\r\nIn talking with @nrc on IRC one solution here would be to avoid using racer's `cargo` feature. The RLS already depends on `cargo`-the-crate and should be able to provide the functionality necessary for racer, for example implementing [racer's `ProjectModelProvider` trait](https://github.com/racer-rust/racer/blob/18bd2c510a195bb21fe520c73c43a4ed9515e6c7/src/racer/project_model.rs#L33-L39)", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53005/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53005/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
