Concretely, the idea would be to remove the `Call`, `Assert`, and `Drop` terminators and make them into statements with an outgoing panic edge.\r\n\r\nSpecifically for call, this would simplify things dramatically because the return value is only for use on the \"return\" edge, and handling that in the current dataflow and so forth is a pain in the neck (this extended basic block form makes that edge more special, which should help). It also helps us have fewer basic blocks.\r\n\r\nWe could conceivably go further, and remove terminators altogether, and instead just have statements, where the final statement should be of \"terminator type\". However, I'm somewhat disinclined to do that, at least not right away, because the majority of the advantage of this format derives from converting call/assert/drop (which \"feel\" linear in code) and not from converting `if` or `match` or other control-flow, since almost always those would terminate the current basic block anyway (since the control-flow joins afterwards). Moreover, the current setup assures that we have a terminator in the right spot, and unifying them with statements would mean we have to maintain that invariant ourselves.\r\n\r\ncc @rust-lang/compiler @nagisa", "closed_by": {"login": "oli-obk", "id": 332036, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAzNg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332036?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk", "html_url": "https://github.com/oli-obk", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39685/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39685/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
