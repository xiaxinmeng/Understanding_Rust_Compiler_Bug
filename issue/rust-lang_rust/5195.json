In Python this is a very common idiom and they actually have a `frozenset` type for this use case, and it's the main reason Python has tuples (which in Python are just immutable lists).\n\nIdeally there would be one implementation of combining hashes and it can be reused. I'm not entirely sure how such a thing would be implemented correctly though.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/5195/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/5195/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
