This forces you to create local variables unnecessarily.  Here's an example of code that I think should compile, but doesn't:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Thingy {\n    i:int\n}\nimpl Thingy {\n    fn do_something_mutable(&mut self, x: int) {\n        // Just assume there's a real reason for self to be mutable here...\n        println(format!(\"{}\", x));\n    }\n    fn get_i(&self) -> int { self.i }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut o = Thingy{ i: 2 };\n    o.do_something_mutable(o.get_i());  // This line should compile, but doesn't\n}\n```\n\nthe error is this:\n\n```\nlifetime-call-param.rs:13:27: 13:28 error: cannot borrow `o` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable\nlifetime-call-param.rs:13     o.do_something_mutable(o.get_i());\n                                                     ^\nlifetime-call-param.rs:13:4: 13:5 note: second borrow of `o` occurs here\nlifetime-call-param.rs:13     o.do_something_mutable(o.get_i());\n                              ^\n```\n\nIf you replace the problematic line with this it compiles and works fine:\n\n```\nlet y = o.get_i();\no.do_something_mutable(y);\n```\n\nbut isn't that equivalent to the non-compiling version?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "huonw", "id": 1203825, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDM4MjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1203825?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw", "html_url": "https://github.com/huonw", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10397/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10397/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
