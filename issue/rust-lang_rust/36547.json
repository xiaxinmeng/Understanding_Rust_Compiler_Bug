It would be useful though if it could bootstrap from the previous-previous release (e.g. 1.13 can be built from 1.11).\n\nConsider that on a Linux distro that is keeping up with Rust releases, if you have their rustc package installed, you cannot build the Rust master branch with it.\n\nIt is not trivial to do this since bootstrapping requires unstable features, and those unstable features change periodically. It would probably require at least the following modifications:\n- Changes to the build system to detect the previous-previous version and set the bootstrap key as appropriate\n- New cfg values that indicate this scenario in order to get through the stage0 build\n- New CI builders that tested this configuration explicitly\n\ncc @glandium @alexcrichton \n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36547/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36547/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
