I'm look up things in the documentation for std now and then.\n\nIdeally, the browser tracks what I have (recently) visited and show links in a different color, so when I see it I know I've read that before. Maybe the link text seems new to me, but I've read it actually. Maybe I'm finding the same doc for some frequent used functions or traits or methods, I can skip those unvisited ones and just spot the right one from visited links.\n\nRust docs have different colors for different links, so changing this will be a couple of lines instead of just one, but I hope it will be done. A darker version of the unvisited link color will be nice.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31786/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31786/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
