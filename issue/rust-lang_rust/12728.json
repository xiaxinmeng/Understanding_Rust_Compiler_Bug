I actually didn't think the following would compile:\n\n``` rust\npub mod path {\n        pub use self::posix::Path_;\n        pub mod posix {\n                pub struct Path_;\n                impl Path_ { // (1)\n                        pub fn one(&self) { println!(\"one\"); }\n                }\n        }\n}\n\npub mod io {\n        pub mod fs {\n                use path;\n                use path::Path_;\n                impl path::Path_ { // (2)\n                        pub fn two(&self) { println!(\"two\"); }\n                }\n        }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n        use path::Path_;\n        Path_.one();\n        Path_.two();\n}\n```\n\nBut it magically does! The twist here is that `(2)` used `impl path::Path_` instead of `impl Path_` (which would trigger a mysterious error message \"found module name used as a type: impl io::fs::Path_::Path_\", which is another story). `Path::stat` lives in `(2)` but rustdoc did merge its docs into `(1)`'s docs (with two sections). The link to  `(2)`'s docs including `Path::stat` does not point the merged page, unfortunately.\n\nThis issue has worth a couple (or possibly three) of subtasks, but I wanted this issue to be described at least. Feel free to make related issues and reduce the scope of this issue.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "huonw", "id": 1203825, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDM4MjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1203825?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw", "html_url": "https://github.com/huonw", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12728/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12728/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
