In fact, `std::ptr` as just a re-export of `core::ptr`.\r\n\r\nHowever, when comparing the two pages, [`core::ptr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/ptr/index.html) is missing a few items compared to [`std::ptr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ptr/index.html): `copy`, `copy_nonoverlapping` and `write_bytes` for some reason are not shown as \"functions\".\r\n\r\nI just realized that thy *are* shown as \"reexports\". So likely I could have made https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/nomicon/pull/165 link to the versions in `core::intrinsics` instead. But we don't actually want people to use those paths, they are available on stable only [due to a bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15702). We'd prefer if people used these symbols through `ptr`, but then it seems we have to link to `std::ptr`, which is somewhat annoying.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/64539/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/64539/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
