More likely this is the result of a half finished transformation of everything to the new generic form.\r\n \nThis happens with the latest rustc nightly.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53746/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53746/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
