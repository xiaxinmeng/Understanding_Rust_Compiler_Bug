The reason is `rustc`\n\nI installed rust from source and wasn't aware that rust ran any background processes, so this activity is concerning. I usually have to kill it a few times before it stops, and I have no idea why, or where it is running from. Is this possible some kind of security issue on my end, or is there some cron job included in the rust installation for updating or something?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "allthetime", "id": 6376965, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzY5NjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6376965?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/allthetime", "html_url": "https://github.com/allthetime", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/allthetime/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/allthetime/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/allthetime/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/allthetime/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/allthetime/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/allthetime/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/allthetime/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/allthetime/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/allthetime/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36751/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36751/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
