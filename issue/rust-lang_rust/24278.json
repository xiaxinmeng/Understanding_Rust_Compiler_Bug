Our lifetimes only carry a `Name`, not an `Ident`, which means the comparisons for shadowing are only doing name based comparisons.\n\nBut macros should be free to introduce labels, and have them be treated as independent due to hygiene.\n\nThis bug is believed to only introduce issues where code will cause a warning to be emitted by the new shadowing check when it should be accepted; i.e. there are not any known soundness issues associated with this problem.\n\n(Note: While loop labels themselves are `Ident`s, much of the syntax system does not treat them the same way it treats \"normal\" variables with respect to e.g. hygiene.  For example the `syntax::visit` system does not invoke `visit_ident` on loop labels.)\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24278/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24278/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
