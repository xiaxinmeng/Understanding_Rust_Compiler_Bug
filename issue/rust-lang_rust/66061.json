This means that they are eligible for becoming `const`. At compile time we could even emulate the operations if necessary.\r\n\r\nSo, we should make all of these `const`.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66061/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 2}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66061/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
