This problem doesn't stop with the initial code size and continues to grow at a rate much faster than C or C++ applications performing the same work. This is not a Rust compiler issue as it doesn't occur when not using the standard library, even when using an API at the same level of abstraction.\n\nRust is linking dynamically against the system libraries so there's really no excuse for them being this large.
