Given the following code:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nmod foo {\r\n    pub struct Bar { field: u8 }\r\n}\r\n\r\nuse foo::Bar;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let x = Bar { field: 12 };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following error is returned:\r\n```txt\r\nerror[E0451]: field `field` of struct `foo::Bar` is private\r\n --> src/main.rs:9:19\r\n  |\r\n9 |     let x = Bar { field: 12 };\r\n  |                   ^^^^^^^^^ private field\r\n```\r\n\r\nA hint could be useful here, but overall this is good enough to understand. However when we convert this to a tuple struct the errors get more confusing:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nmod foo {\r\n    pub struct Bar(u8);\r\n}\r\n\r\nuse foo::Bar;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let x = Bar(12);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis yields the following error:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\nerror[E0423]: expected function, tuple struct or tuple variant, found struct `Bar`\r\n --> src/main.rs:8:13\r\n  |\r\n8 |     let x = Bar(12);\r\n  |             ^^^ constructor is not visible here due to private fields\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe message of `expected function, tuple struct or tuple variant, found struct Bar` is not helpful here. It's a bit confusing what the fix is: how do we make the constructor visible? I had to look up how to declare visibility for inner fields in tuple structs.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe error message could probably use some work. Something closer to the text of non-tuple structs would be clearer:\r\n```txt\r\nfield `0` of struct `foo::Bar` is private\r\n```\r\nOr perhaps an even better direction would be:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\ncannot initialize a tuple struct which contains private fields\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main code block seems useful. But we could go even further and provide a hint on how to fix this if the struct is defined inside the same project:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\nerror[E0423]: cannot initialize a tuple struct which contains private fields\r\n --> src/main.rs:8:13\r\n  |\r\n8 |     let x = Bar(12);\r\n  |             ^^^ constructor is not visible here due to private fields\r\n  |             |\r\n  |             help: declare the struct's fields as public: `struct Bar(pub(crate) u8);`\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nI found a location where our errors aren't as good as they could be, and figured there may be a way we can use that to not just improve the error message -- but actually teach people about visibility modifiers in tuple structs.\r\n\r\nI hope this is helpful.
