After running rustup-init it complained about the missing VC++ build tools (as it should, I didn't have them installed).\r\nI then downloaded and installed them with the first link it suggested (http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools). After rebooting and running rustup it still complained about them allegedly missing. I then just ignored the warning and continued with the installation, which completed succesfully. The target it defaulted to and that it installed is x86_64-pc-windows-msvc. Compiling and running a simple rust program also worked, so it seems like just the diagnostic, whether the build tools are installed didn't work.", "closed_by": {"login": "retep998", "id": 666308, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjMwOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/666308?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/retep998", "html_url": "https://github.com/retep998", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/retep998/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/retep998/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/retep998/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/retep998/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/retep998/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/retep998/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/retep998/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/retep998/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/retep998/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39261/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39261/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
