It ran, and returned to the prompt of my normal user.  I expected the install to go under $HOME/.cargo as it has in the past.  However, in the process, it escalated privileges and installed as root under /usr/local... without my knowledge and without my permission.  I was flabbergasted.\r\n\r\nsudo caches my credentials so I see now how this has happened.  However, as the system administrator, I maintain the expectation that commands that I run as a normal user cannot ~~corrupt~~modify system directories.  This trust was breached.\r\n\r\n**Scripts should not sudo on a users behalf.**\r\n\r\nI love the rust language.  But I've just been ~~hacked~~suprised by this script and as a result I've lost trust in ~~all forms of~~ rustup (until I can tell them apart).  I will only install from tgz ~~from now on~~ for now.\r\n\r\nPlease fix for others.", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37922/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37922/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
