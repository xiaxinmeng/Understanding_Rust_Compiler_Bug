It would be great if this fact was called out.\n## An example of why this is useful:\n\nThe current doc for Rc has:\n- **impl<T> Clone for Rc<T>**\n  - **fn clone(&self) -> Rc<T>**\n    - _Returns a copy of the value. The contents of owned pointers are copied to maintain uniqueness, while the contents of managed pointers are not copied._\n\nThe description doesn't make sense for Rc as you can't put an owned pointer in an Rc so the doc becomes confusing. If there were an indication that the doc was inherited it would be better.\n- **impl<T> Clone for Rc<T>**\n  - **fn clone(&self) -> Rc<T>** `doc inherited from trait Clone`\n    - _Returns a copy of the value.
