Rust prohibits implementations of foreign traits for foreign types according to the nomenclature of [RFC 2541](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2451-re-rebalancing-coherence.md). Now both `Trait1<MyLocalStruct,B>` and `Trait2<MyLocalStruct,B>` are local traits in this crate and in no other according to the rules outlined there (specifically, for a foreign trait to be considered local, it must have generic parameters, and the first generic parameter must be local - since `MyLocalStruct` is local to this crate, there can be no other crates in which these traits are local with these parameters).\r\n\r\nInstead, this happened: \r\n\r\n```\r\nerror[E0119]: conflicting implementations of trait `Trait1<MyLocalStruct, _>` for type `std::vec::Vec<_>`\r\n--> src/main.rs:12:1\r\n|\r\n7  | / impl<B, T> Trait1<MyLocalStruct, B> for T\r\n8  | | where\r\n9  | |     T: Trait2<MyLocalStruct, B>\r\n10 | | {}\r\n| |__- first implementation here\r\n11 |\r\n12 | / impl<B, T> Trait1<MyLocalStruct, B> for Vec<T>\r\n13 | | where\r\n14 | |     T: Trait1<MyLocalStruct, B>\r\n15 | | {}\r\n| |__^ conflicting implementation for `std::vec::Vec<_>`\r\n|\r\n= note: downstream crates may implement trait `Trait2<MyLocalStruct, _>` for type `std::vec::Vec<_>`\r\n```\r\nNote that the \"note\" at the very least is incorrect according to my understanding: No downstream crate can implement `Trait2<MyLocalStruct, _>` for `std::vec::Vec<_>`, because that is a foreign trait on a foreign type everywhere except the standard library and this crate.\r\n\r\nNote also that removing the `B` parameter makes rustc accept this code, even though according to my understanding of the RFC 2541 rules these two cases should be indistinguishable. \r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n<!--\r\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\r\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.60.0 (7737e0b5c 2022-04-04)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 7737e0b5c4103216d6fd8cf941b7ab9bdbaace7c\r\ncommit-date: 2022-04-04\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.60.0\r\nLLVM version: 14.0.0\r\n```\r\nThe behaviour of nightly is identical, with nightly:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.62.0-nightly (4c60a0ea5 2022-05-04)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 4c60a0ea5b2385d7400df9db1ad04e96f2a4c154\r\ncommit-date: 2022-05-04\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.62.0-nightly\r\nLLVM version: 14.0.1\r\n```\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "eds-collabora", "id": 88155680, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTU1Njgw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88155680?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/eds-collabora", "html_url": "https://github.com/eds-collabora", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eds-collabora/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eds-collabora/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eds-collabora/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eds-collabora/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eds-collabora/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eds-collabora/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eds-collabora/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eds-collabora/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eds-collabora/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/96743/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/96743/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
