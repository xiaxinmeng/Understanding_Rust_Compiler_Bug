In theory, one of these intrinsics could be reordered between a call to a C function setting `errno` and a check of the `errno` value in Rust. Rust could ignore this problem, as it will rarely (if ever) occur. However, safety mandates that we either supply our own math library known to not set errno on math errors (glibc is a black sheep in this regard) or stop using these unless something like `-fno-math-errno` is passed (as `clang` handles it on Linux).\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12695/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12695/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
