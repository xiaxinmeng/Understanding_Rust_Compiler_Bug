In case it compiles fine or errors out gracefully, it should mark it as `E-needstest` or perhaps `E-revisit` (as it may very well be still ICEing, just that some changes are necessary). It shouldn't be too hard to identify what the particular code sample is as in most cases it's the only standalone code snippet in the issue description, so no extra process overhead would be necessary for this to work well, I think.\n\nThis could be extended further to work with other types of issues but this is perhaps the most immediately obvious application that I can think of.\n\nI'd love to work on this myself but sadly time is scarce so I'm putting up the idea here, at least. :) I know in the perfect world rustc wouldn't ICE so much that we'd need extra process but since that's a reality that is unlikely to change, this may be worth considering.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24017/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24017/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
