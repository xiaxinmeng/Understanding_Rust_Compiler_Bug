My system is Windows 10, 64-bit; Rust compiler is MSVC ABI; Visual Studio 13 Express for Desktop is installed.\n> \n> After upgrading, all cargo builds failed with \"link.exe could not find ws2_32.lib\". The problem was that the LIB path wasn't set. Setting the environment variable LIB to:\n> \n> \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\\VC\\lib\\amd64\"; \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.1\\Lib\\winv6.3\\um\\x64\" fixed the problem. Your paths may vary, of course, and you might have to add other paths if you have other missing libraries.\n> \n> I'm not sure why this worked with earlier versions of Rust; it seems like it should always have failed.\n\n@retep998 Do you know what we should change to make this work out of the box again?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31151/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31151/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
