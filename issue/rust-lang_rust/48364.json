Not a serious problem, but it's certainly entertaining :)  I tried searching the issue tracker to see if anyone else had experienced this, but I couldn't find anything, so my apologies if this is a duplicate of something.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Right after filing the issue, I decided to go and track it down in the source: it originates [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/9fd7da904b46ff7aa78c2e2cc1986c4975aeccc6/src/librustc_typeck/check/demand.rs#L221), and could probably be fixed easily by checking if the first character is actually a `b` before outputting the message.  Not so sure about the error suggested by the code that immediately follows, which will add a `b` to `include_str!` if a `&[u8]` is expected.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48364/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 3, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48364/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
