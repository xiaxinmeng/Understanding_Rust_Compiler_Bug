Each Rust versions are signed in the git repository. Great! If the \"rustup.sh\" is included in the git repository, it will be possible to anyone to verify the script (from a git tag) before executing it.\n\nMaybe all (including nightly) underlying binaries hashes should \"inherit\" from the signature like with the \"snapshots.txt\" hashes? The main Rust repository or a dedicated one could aggregate all hashes.\n\nSo, the guide could be improved by replacing the \"curl\" instruction with a \"git clone + verify-tag\". This add some extra MB to the download but worth it for more security to users who care.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16442/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16442/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
