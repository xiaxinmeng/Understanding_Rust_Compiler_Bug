We could also pre-allocate an array on the stack and do some sort of `SmallVecDeque`.\r\n\r\nHaving a `String::replace_in_place` could also allow a `Cow::replace_in_place` which only allocates a new string if there's a change.\r\n\r\nI don't have the time for this but I figured I'd post this here anyway, as a tracking issue will be needed anyway.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56415/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56415/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
