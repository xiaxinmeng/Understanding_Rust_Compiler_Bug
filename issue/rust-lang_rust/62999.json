On a 80-columns terminal that's > 17K lines of terminal output just for that one line.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of warnings, one reasonably-sized, because they're on short `#[link]` attribute lines, and one where each corresponding line of source is one of those crazy long, bindgen-generated, ones.\r\n\r\nThey look like:\r\n```\r\nwarning: `extern` block uses type `u128` which is not FFI-safe: 128-bit integers don't currently have a known stable ABI\r\n --> /tmp/coreaudio-sys/target/x86_64-apple-darwin/debug/build/coreaudio-sys-0d8fd082e359c2ec/out/coreaudio.rs:9:210358\r\n  |\r\n9 | ..... 1.4MB line\r\n  | .... 210K whitespaces ^^^^\r\n  |\r\n  = note: #[warn(improper_ctypes)] on by default\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo what each warning is really doing is pointing at 4 characters inside the 1.4MB line.
