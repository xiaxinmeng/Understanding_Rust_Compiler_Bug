This may cause an application to overwrite parts of a file that it did not mean to overwrite (in a DB engine written in Rust, this could cause unrecoverable data corruption!).\n\nDemonstration: https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=9991550d3efb38c93df4&version=stable\nThe expected output of the demo program is `File contents: aBBccc`, the actual output is: `File contents: aBBBBc`\n\nMore generally, we need a story for panic safety in Rust.\nMy takeaway from the related discussions (e.g. [RFC 1236](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1236), #27719, the [RecoverSafe](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/panic/trait.RecoverSafe.html) trait) was that only `unsafe` code and `Drop` impls should have to worry about panic safety. The demo app contains none of these, so I'd consider this a bug in `impl Drop for BufWriter`. (otherwise all `Write` implementations would need to provide the strong exception safety guarantee?)\n\nSolution: `BufWriter` could use temporarily mark the buffer as empty during the `inner.write` calls; so that the `Drop` impl doesn't do anything after a panic.\n\nHowever, this doesn't help if the panic occurs during a `bufWriter.get_mut().write()` call...\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30888/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30888/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
