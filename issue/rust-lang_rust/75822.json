I imagine it's important to mention that panicking happens at runtime with similar conditions that aren't catchable at compile-time, but it's inaccurate.  Here's the error that I get.\r\n```\r\n$ cargo run\r\n   Compiling book_error v0.1.0 (D:\\DDocuments\\PersonalProjects\\LearningRust\\book_error)\r\nerror: this operation will panic at runtime\r\n --> src\\main.rs:5:19\r\n  |\r\n5 |     let element = a[index];\r\n  |                   ^^^^^^^^ index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10\r\n  |\r\n  = note: `#[deny(unconditional_panic)]` on by default\r\n\r\nerror: aborting due to previous error\r\n\r\nerror: could not compile `book_error`.\r\n\r\nTo learn more, run the command again with --verbose.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's the error mentioned in the book:\r\n```\r\n$ cargo run\r\n   Compiling arrays v0.1.0 (file:///projects/arrays)\r\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s\r\n     Running `target/debug/arrays`\r\nthread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10', src/main.rs:5:19\r\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace.\r\n```", "closed_by": {"login": "kkh3049", "id": 2449540, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDk1NDA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2449540?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kkh3049", "html_url": "https://github.com/kkh3049", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kkh3049/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kkh3049/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kkh3049/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kkh3049/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kkh3049/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kkh3049/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kkh3049/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kkh3049/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kkh3049/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75822/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75822/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
