This means we'll need to update the edition guide to handle the 2021 edition as well as any changes to edition process as whole. Concretely, this means the following subtasks:\r\n*  ~~[ ] Add machinery for handling more than just the Rust 2018 edition~~ No machinery needed.\r\n*  [x] Add content specific to the Rust 2021 edition https://github.com/rust-lang/edition-guide/pull/232\r\n*  [x] Rework the 2018 guide to only include edition relevant content. https://github.com/rust-lang/edition-guide/pull/232\r\n  * According to https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3085, editions are no longer thought of as large marketing events for all the changes since the last edition. This is a change from how editions were originally conceived and edition guide should reflect the new reality. \r\n  * For example, the edition guide includes things like [loops being able to break with values](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/control-flow/loops-can-break-with-a-value.html). This change was backported to Rust 2015 and so it is not relevant to the edition and should be removed. \r\n* [ ] Finish 2021 documentation: https://github.com/rust-lang/edition-guide/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AEdition-2021\r\n ", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82940/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82940/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
