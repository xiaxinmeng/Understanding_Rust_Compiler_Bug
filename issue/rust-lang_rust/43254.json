This, however, would still be very useful in allowing `nix` to provide good ergonomics. Right now `nix` offers a few type wrappers and we implement these traits for it. But we cannot write out functions like `close<T: IntoRawFd>(fd: T)` because while it would work for our wrapped types, it wouldn't work for the plain `RawFd` type. We could write a newtype within `nix` to wrap `RawFd` and implement things this way, but it kind of tears the `RawFd` ecosystem in half doing that.\r\n\r\nI think the only way to do this is to use a newtype instead of a type alias for `RawFd`. I'm pretty certain, however, that couldn't be done in a backwards-compatible manner, but maybe I'm wrong. Anyways, just wanted to see what the response would be to this and if there might be upcoming Rust features that could make such a solution possible.", "closed_by": {"login": "dtolnay", "id": 1940490, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDA0OTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1940490?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay", "html_url": "https://github.com/dtolnay", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43254/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43254/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
