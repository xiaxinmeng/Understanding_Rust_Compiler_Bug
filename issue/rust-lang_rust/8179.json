This means that every static referenced from another crate will be re-translated into the current crate, thereby giving it a different address than ones in other crates.\n\nFor optimizations, I can see where this is nice to know the value of the static, but this breaks any usage of cross-crate TLS apis. Namely, this prevents conditions from working cross-crate. I can think of two fixes for this:\n1. All addresses of external statics are resolved through whatever LLVM's equivalent of `extern` references are.\n2. Statics can be tagged with some `#[]` attribute meaning that their address is significant or that they basically shouldn't be re-translated into other crates.\n\nI would prefer option 1 over option 2, but I'm not sure if performance for optimizations would suffer as a result. I _think_ that the fix might go into `trans_addr_of`, but I'm not sure where the best place for this would be.\n\ncc @graydon (you were interested in cross-crate conditions not working)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8179/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8179/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
