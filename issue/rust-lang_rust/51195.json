the same lexical scope. \r\n\r\n * (I personally am not a fan of the use of the word \"created\" in the error message there, since I attach that word to the dynamic semantics, while drop order is entirely defined by the  *declaration order*, which is part of the static semantics (or really, part of the source syntax itself). The only thing that's potentially dynamic is whether or not a local variable actually holds  a value at the moment that we go out of that local variable's scope.)\r\n\r\nBut anyway, the point is that NLL is failing to say anything at all on the matter, which is probably not ideal for Rust's target audience.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51195/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51195/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
