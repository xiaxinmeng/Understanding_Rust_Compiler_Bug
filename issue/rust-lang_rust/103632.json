On the [Arrays and Slices](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/primitives/array.html) page, the last line of the example is supposed to cause an \"index out of bounds\" compile error when un-commented, but this does not happen. Instead, the code compiles with no error and a `thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 5'` error shows up at runtime.\r\n\r\nHere is a shortened version of this example that erroneously compiles:\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let xs: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\r\n    for i in 0..xs.len() + 1 {\r\n        match xs.get(i) {\r\n            Some(xval) => println!(\"{}: {}\", i, xval),\r\n            None => println!(\"Slow down! {} is too far!\", i),\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    println!(\"{}\", xs[5]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf you remove the `for` loop then the compiler properly complains. This problem occurs with both the latest stable (1.64.0) and nightly versions. Because this issue exists with nightly, I do not think that it is the same as #103385. Nightly information is given below.\r\n### Meta\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.64.0 (a55dd71d5 2022-09-19)\r\nbinary: rustc                                        \r\ncommit-hash: a55dd71d5fb0ec5a6a3a9e8c27b2127ba491ce52\r\ncommit-date: 2022-09-19                              \r\nhost: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc                         \r\nrelease: 1.64.0                                      \r\nLLVM version: 14.0.6 \r\n```\r\n<details><summary>Backtrace</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```\r\nthread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 5', main.rs:9:20\r\nstack backtrace:\r\n   0: std::panicking::begin_panic_handler\r\n             at /rustc/a55dd71d5fb0ec5a6a3a9e8c27b2127ba491ce52/library\\std\\src\\panicking.rs:584\r\n   1: core::panicking::panic_fmt\r\n             at /rustc/a55dd71d5fb0ec5a6a3a9e8c27b2127ba491ce52/library\\core\\src\\panicking.rs:142\r\n   2: core::panicking::panic_bounds_check\r\n             at /rustc/a55dd71d5fb0ec5a6a3a9e8c27b2127ba491ce52/library\\core\\src\\panicking.rs:84\r\n   3: core::fmt::Arguments::new_v1\r\n   4: core::ops::function::FnOnce::call_once\r\nnote: Some details are omitted, run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` for a verbose backtrace.\r\n```\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details>", "closed_by": {"login": "markgras", "id": 17365607, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzY1NjA3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17365607?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/markgras", "html_url": "https://github.com/markgras", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markgras/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markgras/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markgras/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markgras/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markgras/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markgras/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markgras/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markgras/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markgras/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103632/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103632/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
