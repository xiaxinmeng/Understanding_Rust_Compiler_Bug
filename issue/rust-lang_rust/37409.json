I've been working on updating msys2's rust package. As noted in the [appveyor.yml](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/appveyor.yml) rust i686-pc-windows-gnu doesn't build on the default mingw32 compiler. \n\n> For 32-bit the installed gcc toolchain on AppVeyor uses the pthread threading model. This is unfortunately not what we want, and if we compile with it then there's lots of link errors in the standard library (undefined references to pthread symbols).\n\nWhy does it compile with the 64-bit mingw64 gcc then? What is so different that it compiles with the 64-bit one but not the 32-bit gcc? If this is not rust's fault, could a bug be filed on the [MINGW-Packages](https://github.com/Alexpux/MINGW-packages) repo by someone who knows what the problem is?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37409/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37409/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
