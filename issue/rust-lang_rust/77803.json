For example, things like calls to `ptr::write` actually turn into procedure calls at the machine level, whereas they should really always be inlined. We could consider actually performing a subset of MIR optimizations in debug mode, to produce simpler IR and therefore to reduce compile time and improve performance of debug mode code. Naturally, these optimizations need to be carefully written to preserve DWARF debug info, but DWARF has many features designed to enable this sort of thing.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77803/reactions", "total_count": 12, "+1": 8, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 4, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77803/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
