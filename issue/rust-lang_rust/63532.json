Looking for a date time validator, I found none within rust sufficient to address all the JSR-310.\r\n\r\nThank you for listening.", "closed_by": {"login": "jonas-schievink", "id": 1786438, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY0Mzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786438?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonas-schievink", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63532/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63532/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
