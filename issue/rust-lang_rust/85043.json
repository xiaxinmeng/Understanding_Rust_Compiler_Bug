I would probably lean towards \"none\" in this particular case, in part because it would be easier to implement properly situations where re-exports don't share the features of the modules that are being re-exported. For instance:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[doc(cfg(feature=\"include_file\"))]\r\npub mod include_file {\r\n    pub fn generated() {}\r\n}\r\n#[doc(cfg(feature=\"reexport_glob\"))]\r\npub use include_file::*;\r\n#[doc(cfg(feature=\"reexport_generated\"))]\r\npub use include_file::generated;\r\n#[doc(cfg(feature=\"reexport_renamed\"))]\r\npub use include_file::generated as renamed;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich generates exactly the same documentation page as shown above. I believe in this case we should show exactly the specified `cfg` badges, rather than attempting to infer from what items are being re-exported.\r\n\r\n(related https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83428, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43781)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85043/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85043/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
