This is the default suggestion when building something that lacks `#![no_std]` when using nightly. However, when using a `no_std` build, the error does not match, and diagnosing the issue becomes a bit of a roadblock, and somewhat challenging at times. As a result, the final help hint should recommend building `libcore` with `-Zbuild-std=core` instead when this kind of build is expected.\r\n\r\nNote, building this with the correct flag will still throw up an error about lacking a spec file in a clean environment (3dsx.specs) - this is fine, and not a bug of rustc/cargo, and is also not required to reproduce the issue. It is also not exclusive to the `armv6k-nintendo-3ds` target, but it was a useful one to use here - pick any tier 3 target that lacks `libstd` support.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf dramatically different output is caused by small changes, consider also\r\nadding them here.\r\n\r\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\r\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions. The output might also be\r\ndifferent depending on the Edition.\r\n-->\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/91459/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/91459/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
