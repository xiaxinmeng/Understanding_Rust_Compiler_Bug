I don't have any specific numbers, but \"join\" seems to be used more widely.\n\nWe could not use \"join\" because it was previously a keyword. Now it isn't, and `SliceConcatExt` is currently marked as unstable, so how about renaming the method to a more popular name?\n\nOne blocker is that `SliceConcatExt` is already exported to the prelude. So, although it is technically unstable, the change will still break the currently accepted beta-compatible code.\n\nWill this require a RFC?\n\ncc http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/336rj3/whats_the_best_way_to_join_strings_with_a_space/\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24645/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24645/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
