Because of this when I imported the trait `OutputPin` and tried to use it I got E0599 with the following message: \r\n\r\n```\r\n help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is in scope\r\n help: the following trait is implemented but not in scope, perhaps add a `use` for it\r\n```\r\nHowever, I had imported the trait the issue was down to the versions not matching up. I also heard some other people had encountered the same confusion with some futures code so it seems this could definitely stand to be made more helpful to users.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Looks like after googling this is a known issue and there's been work to improve it i.e. #28300 so feel free to close this if there's already an issue for it I missed!", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51458/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51458/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
