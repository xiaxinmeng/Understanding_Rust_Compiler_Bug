The standard library tests are now being built with codegen-units=1 due to this.  This has unearthed a miscompilation with llvm-10. In my tests, llvm-11 also seems to have the same problem, but llvm-12 seems to work correctly.\r\n\r\nThe test that seems to be failing is [`test_copy_within`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/68a698baf6bfc61d85ce6e25122a092c60c7f21a/library/core/tests/slice.rs#L2046-L2074).  Somehow the optimizations are causing it to compile down to an unconditional call to the first `assert_eq` being a failure.\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced on latest master with `llvm-10-dev` installed on Ubuntu 20:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# llvm-10 is installed with `apt install llvm-10-dev`\r\n# Also fails with llvm-11, but not llvm-12\r\n./configure --llvm-root=/usr/lib/llvm-10 --enable-llvm-link-shared\r\n./x.py build library/std\r\n\r\ncat <<EOF >> foo.rs\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let mut bytes = *b\"Hello, World!\";\r\n    bytes.copy_within(..3, 10);\r\n    assert_eq!(&bytes, b\"Hello, WorHel\");\r\n}\r\nEOF\r\n\r\n./build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage1/bin/rustc foo.rs -Copt-level=3 -Ccodegen-units=1\r\n./foo\r\n```\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90153/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90153/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
