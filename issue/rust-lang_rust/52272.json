I discussed locally on discord though with @aturon and @Mark-Simulacrum that I'd personally prefer to distribute `cargo fix` by default to users. In any case, a decision should be made!\r\n\r\nI believe we have one of three options here to us:\r\n\r\n* **Do nothing** - continue to ship `cargo fix` through `cargo install`. This has the benefit of not needing any work to get it done. It has a downside, however, of requiring users to opt-in to acquiring `cargo fix`. Additionally it introduces the possibility for version skew where `cargo fix` is either too old or too new by accident.\r\n* **Ship a rustup component** - here we'd enable something like `rustup component add cargo-fix` or automatically enable it by default for new installations. This allows us to control versioning and provide it by default, but it requires a relatively large amount of rustbuild/dist work.\r\n* **Merge `cargo-fix` into Cargo** - here we'd merge the `cargo fix` subcommand inside the `rustfix` repository to Cargo itself upstream, depending on the `rustfix` crate from crates.io. This has the benefits of shipping a rustup component but it's a little easier to do in terms of distribution. The downside of this approach is that, like a component, it ties rustfix to the trains so getting out a hotfix is more fuss (needs a full Rust release)\r\n\r\nI'm personally inclined to go the route of \"merge `cargo-fix` into Cargo\". I don't believe `rustfix` has had many major changes and/or big bugs reported, so merging it into Cargo should require little-to-no fuss and the need for a hotfix should be pretty low. I'm curious to hear what others think though!\r\n\r\ncc @killercup ", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52272/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52272/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
