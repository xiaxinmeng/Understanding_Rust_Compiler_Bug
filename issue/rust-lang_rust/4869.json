If you have a pointer to that object, I'd say that it's much more plausible that you'll want that pointer to yield the same string, not \"@\" + that string. If you don't want that, you at least want control over the stringification.\n\nIt only makes sense to _require_ the current semantics if ToStr is defined as behaving like Python's `repr` functionality. But it isn't. (For instance, quite reasonably `(s: str).to_str() = s`, not `\"\\\"\" + escape(s) + \"\\\"\"`.)\n\nIf I comment out the default implementations for pointers and the tests specific to those pointers, I can rebuild all of Rust and all of the remaining tests pass.\n\nIf these default implementations are removed, then `(~[1, 2, 3]).to_str()` starts evaluating to \"[1, 2, 3]\" rather than \"~[1, 2, 3]\". I claim that this is desirable.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4869/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4869/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
