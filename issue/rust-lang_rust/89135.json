warn-by-default lint, `rustdoc::invalid_rust_codeblocks`, which is intended to tell users when rustdoc sees a Rust language code block which is not valid Rust. However, this lint seems to have always been pretty broken: it only attempted to tokenize the input, not actually parse it into a Rust program. So in most cases before almost any text passed in would've not triggered the lint (e.g., the code blocks on this page -- which are clearly not valid Rust -- do not: https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.55.0/nightly-rustc/rustc_metadata/dependency_format/index.html).\r\n\r\nHowever, with the 2021 edition, we have reserved ~any prefix in strings (`foo'bar`, for example), which causes this lint to fire on quite a lot of this previously accepted Rust code. This is not *technically* a breaking change -- the lint is warn by default, and is just a lint -- but in practice I worry that the perception will be quite a lot of breakage. The compiler hit quite a few [cases](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/49ed5cefcedba18f4d2d2757e44c72dec69effc0) in the migration, which all had to be fixed manually -- no rust fix exists here, and can't easily be added I suspect.", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/89135/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/89135/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
