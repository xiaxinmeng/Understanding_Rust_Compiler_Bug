I am interested to find out whether the rust community has a method of solving 98% of this problem, not 100%.\r\n\r\nSome example approaches here would include:\r\n- having crates.io make it really obvious that safe code within a dependency talks to the network or disk.\r\n- having dependency-level sandboxing (perhaps declare in Cargo.toml that a package may use the network/write to disk etc)\r\n- separating dependencies which use safe only from dependencies which include unsafe\r\n- requiring packages which are new (less than two years old), fewer than 100k users, and which use unsafe to be marked as \"experimental\"\r\n\r\nAdditional potential approaches are very welcome", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100597/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 2, "-1": 1, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100597/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
