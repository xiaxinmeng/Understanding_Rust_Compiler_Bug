because the overarching problem is the problem, if you will.  if I should have made a bunch, let me know.\r\n\r\nLooks like the following applies to beta.  Example page: https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html\r\n\r\nI'm a screen reader user (e.g. blind).  Specifically NVDA.  Whatever changes are coming down the pipeline with Rustdoc make the above-linked page difficult to navigate.  It used to be the case that you could get used to the weird heading structure (specifically that Rustdoc headings are higher levels than example/error headings) then be mostly fine.  But now:\r\n\r\n- A lot of what used to be headings are exposed as buttons.\r\n- All of those buttons like to start with `[-]`, which screen readers are forced to listen to as \"left bracket dash right bracket\", e.g. \"left bracket dash right bracket pub fn\".\r\n- There's a table of contents, but it only shows up if the page is maximized, and if there's a button to expand it I can't quickly find it.\r\n- Said table of contents provides no way to quickly navigate it, e.g. \"methods\" being a heading, using lists, etc.  I have to ctrl+f the categories.\r\n\r\nI manage because I'm a screen reader power user who has previous familiarity with these pages, which meant that mostly getting around/through this was working out what actually changed rather than how to do it from scratch.  It still hit my efficiency quite a bit.  Most screen reader users aren't going to know to maximize their browser and ctrl+f \"methods\" and so on, or work out that actually sometimes you need next heading and sometimes you need next button.\r\n\r\nSome concrete fixes:\r\n\r\n- Put the `h` tags back (maybe we can do this with aria, if the buttons are important).\r\n- move `[-]` to the end of the line, where it used to be. I think this can be faked with css if we need the visual representation to stay the same, but I'm a backend guy.\r\n- Change the \"headings\" in the table of contents to be actual h tags, perhaps with nested links, or make the table of contents nested lists like mdbook.\r\n- make sure that the table of contents is always visible, or that the button to expand/collapse it is more obvious if there is one.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to discuss other fixes as well; my goal is to provide some sort of conversation starter.", "closed_by": {"login": "GuillaumeGomez", "id": 3050060, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTAwNjA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3050060?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez", "html_url": "https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87059/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87059/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
