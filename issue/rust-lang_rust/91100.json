Proposed tap behavior:\r\n \r\n If a tooltip is open, and was opened by hover, tapping its trigger does nothing.\r\n If a tooltip is closed, clicking (tapping) its trigger opens it.\r\n If a tooltip is open, and was opened by clicking, clicking its trigger again closes it.\r\n \r\n This should produce good behavior with both touchscreens and pointer devices. The goal is to avoid a frustrating situation where someone using a pointer device moves the mouse to the trigger with plans to click it, and clicks it milliseconds after the hover triggered, closing the tooltip again.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/91100/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/91100/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
