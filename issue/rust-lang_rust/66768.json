Please also see the discussion therein. However, it seems to be sufficiently different as to warrant its own issue.\r\n\r\nHere is an example [build log](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/files/3890767/buildlog.txt)\r\n\r\nI've created a relatively minimal testcase, and @WildCryptoFox helped me minimize it further. The testcase can be found here: https://github.com/Andlon/ice_testcase . The current `rust-toolchain` file is set to `nightly-2019-11-26`, but the bug manifests for a number of different version of `nightly` (but not all!), as well as `beta`, and before minification it was also present on `stable`.\r\n\r\nThe conditions triggering the ICE seem to be very brittle: Changing features of dependencies or removing unused dependencies might make the ICE vanish. See also @WildCryptoFox's observations in the aforementioned issue #65934.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66768/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66768/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
