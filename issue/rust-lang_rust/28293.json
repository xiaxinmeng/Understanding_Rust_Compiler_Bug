After some simplification of my code, it was reduced to following program:\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let a: i32 = 0;\n    let b: i32 = 0;\n    let aa = &a;\n    // works\n    if b - aa < 0 { }\n    // unexpected e0308 error    \n    if b < aa {  }\n}\n```\n\nHere we have two `if` statements. First compiles OK, and second fails with compiler error E0308: It complains on \"incompatible\" types `i32` and `&i32`. However, expression in first `if` also contains variables of different types, and does not irritate Rust compiler.\nI suppose it's a bug, because this behaviour is counter-intuitive.\n\nNote: I've tested it on stable 1.2.0 and nightly versions (via http://play.rust-lang.org) - results are the same.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28293/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28293/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
