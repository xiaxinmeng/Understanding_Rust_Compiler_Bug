Sandboxing is very important to [Servo](http://github.com/mozilla/servo), which has some initial sandboxing libraries.\n- Network-based messaging and actors\n- Reliable failure and recovery schemes. Rust has linked task failure, but no higher-level constructs to help users make use of it for creating reliable systems ala Erlang OTP.\n\nTake inspiration from Scala, Akka and Erlang.\n\nThis probably isn't suitable for the main repo, but would be very useful for projects like Servo.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3573/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3573/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
