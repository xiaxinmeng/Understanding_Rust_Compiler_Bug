Generally, the only new language features added after this milestone must be backwards compatible, or to fix soundness holes, though we do expect to have some leeway to make small incompatible fixes that have low impact on existing code bases.\r\n\r\n* Library stability - We have a system of measuring and ensuring the stability of API's, and a significant portion of the standard library is declared stable. Stable API's will not change. Large portions of the standard library need to be stable for 1.0, including primitive types, vectors, strings, option, numerics, collections, some I/O and concurrency.\r\n\r\n* User experience - The system is polished and the presentation is complete and professional. New users have a clear path to using and learning the system. This encompasses the web site, documentation, installation, and tooling.\r\n", "creator": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 376, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2013-10-10T18:48:33Z", "updated_at": "2016-08-28T23:13:24Z", "due_on": "2015-05-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2015-05-21T20:59:13Z"}, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2014-07-08T15:51:11Z", "updated_at": "2014-07-16T06:06:18Z", "closed_at": "2014-07-16T06:06:18Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "STR:\n\n``` rust\nstruct MyVec<T> {\n    data: Vec<T>,\n}\n\nimpl<T> Index<uint, T> for MyVec<T> {\n    fn index<'a>(&'a self, &i: &uint) -> &'a T {\n        assert!(i < self.data.len());\n        &self.data.as_slice()[i]\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let v = MyVec { data: vec!(box 1i, box 2, box 3) };\n\n    let ok: &Box<int> = v.index(&0);\n\n    // Partial move while `v` is borrowed\n    let bad: Box<int> = v[0];\n\n    // Boom!\n    println!(\"{}\", good);\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n$ rustc foo.rs && ./foo\n[1]    20073 segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./foo\n```\n\nGDB:\n\n```\n$ gdb ./foo\n(..)\nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n0x0000000000489c79 in fmt::num::int.fmt..Show::fmt::he5f803ef1f438abdOsJ ()\n(..)\n```\n\nVersion:\n\n```\n$ rustc --version\nrustc 0.11.0 (e2e237afc1f9887699414c33332faa1efaba41ce 2014-07-08 09:56:41 +0000)\n```\n\ncc @pcwalton\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15525/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15525/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
