Make sure to include the relevant\r\nRFC for the feature if it has one. Otherwise provide a short summary of the\r\nfeature and link any relevant PRs or issues, and remove any sections that are\r\nnot relevant to the feature.\r\n\r\nRemember to add team labels to the tracking issue.\r\nFor a language team feature, this would e.g., be `T-lang`.\r\nSuch a feature should also be labeled with e.g., `F-my_feature`.\r\nThis label is used to associate issues (e.g., bugs and design questions) to the feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for extending available ABIs for var-args functions.\r\nThe feature gate for the issue is `#![feature(extended_varargs_abi_support)]`.\r\n\r\n### About tracking issues\r\n\r\nTracking issues are used to record the overall progress of implementation.\r\nThey are also used as hubs connecting to other relevant issues, e.g., bugs or open design questions.\r\nA tracking issue is however *not* meant for large scale discussion, questions, or bug reports about a feature.\r\nInstead, open a dedicated issue for the specific matter and add the relevant feature gate label.\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n<!--\r\nInclude each step required to complete the feature.
