It worked properly in 1.20.  I don't see any discussion there about renaming, so I am assuming this was unintended. At the time, there was only one renamed lint (`unknown_features` -> `unused_features`), so I suspect there just wasn't much attention to it.  \r\n\r\nIt looks like at various points there were attempts to add tests for these kinds of things (#30878 added the [`lint-renamed.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/94736c434ee154b30e2ec22ec112b79e3f6c5884/src/test/ui/lint/lint-renamed.rs) test, which doesn't actually validate that the renamed lint works, just that it emits a warning).\r\n\r\nTested up to latest  rustc 1.52.0-nightly (9c09c1f7c 2021-02-26)\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82615/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82615/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
