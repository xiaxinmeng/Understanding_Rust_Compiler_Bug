These methods would: \n1. Reserve the necessary space,\n2. Shift over all of the pre-existing elements to make room,\n3. Copy in the new values.\n\nCaveat: we would need to ensure that `fail!` does not occur between steps 2 and 3.\n\nMuch like with `push_all`/`push_all_move`, the advantage would be avoiding repeatedly re-growing the vector, the way that calling `insert` in a loop will do.\n\n(The `insert_all` and `insert_all_move` may have to have their own dedicated implementations, rather than being layed atop an iterator-based abstraction the way that `push_all`/`push_all_move` are atop `Extendable::extend`, because of the caveat given above (we cannot call out to arbitrary iterator code during step 3 because we cannot allow failure while the vector is in an intermediate state where it has partially blank innards).\n\nI am filing this mostly as a note because while I was working on #15418, I found a potential need for methods like these to avoid quadratic asymptotic runtimes.  But it is probably not a high priority.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15435/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15435/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
