When building crate A rustc finds the library for crate B based on the metadata, then it goes through and finds all the dependencies of crate B, etc. Once it recurses and starts resolving dependencies of dependencies it stops doing any metadata matching and just looks for the name of the crate. This could easily result in situations where rustc loads the wrong crate.\n\nTo fix this we need to encode all the matched metadata for a crate's dependencies.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "lht", "id": 19508, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTA4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19508?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lht", "html_url": "https://github.com/lht", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lht/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lht/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lht/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lht/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lht/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lht/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lht/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lht/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lht/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2138/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2138/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
