In those messages, when a lifetime is printed, it is printed with a leading `&` in addition to the `'` that is part of its name.  For example:\n\n`[...] the lifetime cannot outlive the lifetime &'z1  as defined [...]`.\n\nIn my opinion, this is confusing.  `'z` is a lifetime, while `&'z` are the first three characters of some (incomplete) type expression that is missing the pointed-to type (along with a potential `mut` qualifier).\n\nI suspect the leading `&` is arising probably some artifact of how the code is implementing the `fmt::Default` trait; it might also involve the use of `bound_region_ptr_to_str` as the implementation of how lifetimes are printed (even though the former says it is for printing ptrs, not lifetimes).\n\n---\n\nAlso, there is an extra space between `&'z` and `as defined` above.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10291/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10291/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
