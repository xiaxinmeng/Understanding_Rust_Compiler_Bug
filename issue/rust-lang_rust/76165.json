Some issues that have been mentioned:\r\n\r\n- `x.py test` does not run `ui-fulldeps` (and inherently can't with `--stage 1`): https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75404#issuecomment-672574511\r\n- `x.py doc` uses stage 0 by default which is not my preference, I almost always want `---stage 1`. But new contributors will normally want `--stage 0`, so it doesn't make sense to change it for everyone.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to allow configuring the default stage on a per-subcommand level. This would both make it easier to add new commands to the test suite (e.g. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70533#issuecomment-680003866), and more convenient for local contributors who want defaults other than those hardcoded into bootstrap. The existing defaults could still be left in `config.toml.example`, making this backwards-compatible for contributors.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76165/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76165/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
