found myself writing the following:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Debug, Clone)]\r\nenum Stuff {\r\n  Blank,\r\n  Holder{\r\n    thing: u64,\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nimpl Stuff {\r\n  fn is_blank(&self) -> bool {\r\n    match self {\r\n      &Stuff::Blank => true,\r\n      &Stuff::Holder{...} => false,\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main(){\r\n  println!(\"{}\", Stuff::Blank.is_blank());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is wrong because it should be `Stuff::Holder{..}`: wrong number of dots in the match.\r\n\r\nBut the error message I got is this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: expected identifier, found `...`\r\n  --> ellipsis.rs:14:22\r\n   |\r\n14 |       &Stuff::Holder{...} => false,\r\n   |                      ^^^\r\n\r\nerror[E0027]: pattern does not mention field `thing`\r\n  --> ellipsis.rs:14:8\r\n   |\r\n14 |       &Stuff::Holder{...} => false,\r\n   |        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ missing field `thing`\r\n\r\nerror: aborting due to 2 previous errors\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis isn't an intrinsically unreasonable error message or anything, but it totally mislead me: I did not parse \"expected identifier, found `...`\" as meaning \"You have the wrong number of dots and three dots is not valid syntax here\", I just figured that I was misunderstanding something and that e.g. you had to mention at least one field or something and the ellipsis syntax was only for then ignoring the *other* fields.\r\n\r\nThis was I think compounded by the fact that it provided a second error message \"pattern does not mention field `thing`\" because it meant that I didn't read it as \"You have a syntax error\" but \"You have a syntactically valid pattern match that happens not to be semantically valid due to some requirement you don't understand\".\r\n\r\n##
