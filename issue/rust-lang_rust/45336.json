What we wanted was \r\n\r\n```\r\nsome_option.ok_or::<Box<Error>>(From::from(\r\n            \"Did not expect None here\"\r\n                .to_string(),\r\n        ))? \r\n```\r\n\r\nIt may be worth linting against things like this somehow, because it's really hard to spot if it happens. Even after I'd already been bitten by it, it took me a few minutes to spot it in his code.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how general it can be, but at a first glance if a function returns `Result<T,E>` and takes in an `E` as an argument linting against using `?` on the argument in the `E` position(s) may work. But if not, linting against the use of `?` in `std` functions like `ok_or` whose purpose is to construct an error works too.", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45336/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45336/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
