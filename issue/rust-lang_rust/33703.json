I can recreate it consistently as follows:\n\n_typeid_issue/lib.rs:_\n\n``` rust\npub fn check() {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", std::any::TypeId::of::<Box<Fn() -> ()>>());\n}\n```\n\n_typeid_issue/examples/example.rs:_\n\n``` Rust\nextern crate typeid_issue;\n\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", std::any::TypeId::of::<Box<Fn() -> ()>>());\n    typeid_issue::check();\n}\n```\n\nOn my machine, `cargo run --example example` with the above project outputs two different `TypeId`s. The same thing doesn't happen for all types, e.g. `Box<i32>`s seem to work fine, and `Box<Fn() -> ()>` wrapped in a struct seems to work fine giving me a nice work around for now.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33703/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33703/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
