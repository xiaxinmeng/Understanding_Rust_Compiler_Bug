And the same is for Rust's own console when you attempt to execute your program from Desktop's Explorer.\n\nI did make a quick peek into code for Process but there seems to be no windows specific things so maybe there is something wrong in nutshell. I suspect there are high chances that there can be some windows issue \n\nBUT\nprocess::Command method output() is able to capture stdout just fine.\n\nI'm using Beta3 compiler:\nrustc 1.0.0-beta.3 (5241bf9c3 2015-04-25) (built 2015-04-25)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "DoumanAsh", "id": 5676053, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzYwNTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5676053?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh", "html_url": "https://github.com/DoumanAsh", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25124/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25124/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
