The sub-syntaxes should be exposed stably in other ways to end users, for example through macros. Alternatively, the syntax should be changed before stabilization to something that doesn't use `builtin #`. In any way, stabilization is specific to each feature that uses `builtin #`.\r\n  \r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\nThe MCP lists a few potential use cases for `builtin #`, but the list is not final (and probably will keep changing).\r\n\r\n### Implementation history\r\n\r\n* #110694", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110680/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110680/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
