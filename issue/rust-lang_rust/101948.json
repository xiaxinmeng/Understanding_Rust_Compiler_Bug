That's handy, but there is a rather large margin applied to each function snippet. Starting in the ~middle there's a right to left 'sweep' of a veritcal bar in the multiline snippets\r\n\r\nI tried to minimally reproduce this by putting 200/300 `fn check {}`s in their own modules but that didn't seem to work\r\n\r\nHere's the output of `cargo check` on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/commit/e120fb10c60a27670c72e7ec99e93d16c045f493 after adding `check();` to `clippy_lints/src/lib.rs`: https://gist.github.com/Alexendoo/210cf32bd7e6248431604df767d2d13a", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/101948/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/101948/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
