I believe @eddyb started working on this, but got a bit sidetracked because they ran into the fact that we're shifting pointers down so that we can high-bit-tag instead of low-bit-tag, and while this isn't *per-se* a problem for strict-provenance, it wasn't obviously portable to CHERI, which sucks.\r\n\r\nSince then it's been clarified that e.g. Morello (CHERI on ARM) actually has allowances for high-bit tagging *and* pointer shifting, so it's possible that the code can just be changed to properly use pointers and `with_addr` and friends.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/95493/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/95493/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
