These methods include (for every primitive integer type, i.e. `{u,i}{8,16,32,64,128,size}`):\r\n\r\n- [`overflowing_add`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.u8.html#method.overflowing_add)\r\n- [`overflowing_sub`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.u8.html#method.overflowing_sub)\r\n- [`overflowing_mul`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.u8.html#method.overflowing_mul)\r\n- [`overflowing_shl`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.u8.html#method.overflowing_shl)\r\n- [`overflowing_shr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.u8.html#method.overflowing_shr)\r\n\r\nThis proposal depends on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/57175 as the above methods use `let` bindings.\r\nStabilization won't proceed until #57175 is stabilized.\r\n\r\nSince the methods above are pure arithmetic there should be no reason not to eventually make these into `const fn`s, and since we are gaining that ability, now is as good a time as any.\r\n\r\nAs with other constification proposals for primitive arithmetic (i.e. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/57234 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57105) I've included T-Lang since this affects intrinsics (`add_with_overflow`, `sub_with_overflow`, and `mul_with_overflow`) and the operational semantics of Rust's `const fn` fragment. This is the last in a series of constification proposals.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nTo avoid depending on 2 other PRs which will inevitably cause merge conflicts I've avoided creating another PR and will instead do so once FCP nears completion.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57237/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57237/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
