We want to fix the situation in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65031 and having this lint could help with that.\r\n\r\n@Mark-Simulacrum had the idea of introducing an internal lint to ban it. This will cause some large diffs for `syntax_pos::symbol::` in particular but that should be gradually fixable on a crate-by-crate basis through `#![allow(...)]` and it is mostly mechanical.\r\n\r\ncc @oli-obk @nikomatsakis ", "closed_by": {"login": "petrochenkov", "id": 5751617, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTE2MTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5751617?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov", "html_url": "https://github.com/petrochenkov", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/65233/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/65233/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
