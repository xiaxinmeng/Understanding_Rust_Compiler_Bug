But then I see the commit message (in the case when the PR consists of just one commit), and it turns out that it has no *body* (only a *summary line*). I wonder, why don\u2019t more people just duplicate the PR comment to the commit message body (or vice versa)? Again, in the case when the PR consists of a single commit.\r\n\r\nIn some cases a commit message does not need a body. But if one has written a PR comment, then that strongly suggests (in my opinion) that having a commit message body would improve the commit.\r\n\r\nAnother argument is that GitHub will automatically duplicate the commit message body to the PR comment, if the PR is just a single commit. So at least if you write the *description* for the change that you are requesting a pull for pre-PR, you don\u2019t even have to manually copy-and-paste. \u263a\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some cases where a PR comment makes sense, while it wouldn\u2019t necessarily make sense to duplicate it to the commit message. Maybe the comment is pretty specific to the pull request, while not being relevant to the commit itself. In other words, maybe the PR comment would be out-of-place as an entry in `git log`.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "LemmingAvalanche", "id": 2229597, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjk1OTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2229597?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/LemmingAvalanche", "html_url": "https://github.com/LemmingAvalanche", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LemmingAvalanche/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LemmingAvalanche/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LemmingAvalanche/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LemmingAvalanche/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LemmingAvalanche/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LemmingAvalanche/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LemmingAvalanche/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LemmingAvalanche/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/LemmingAvalanche/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38379/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38379/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
