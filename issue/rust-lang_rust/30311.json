As I understand it, this is effectively a type-level function being passed a proof that `B: ToOwned`, which necessarily includes a proof that `<B as ToOwned>::Owned: Borrow<B>`.  Requiring an additional proof that `<B as ToOwned>::Owned == O` to instantiate the `fn` shouldn't weaken that\u2026 right?\n\nIndeed, what I'd expected was the opposite: that I could declare `where B: ToOwned<Owned=O>` and that would be enough to satisfy any `O: Borrow<B>` obligations within the scope of the binder (e.g., calling `HashMap::get`) without having to explicitly declare that.\n\nThe above example is trivial for simplicity's sake, but the context where I ran into this wasn't: the owned type was an associated type of a type parameter of the `impl` containing the `fn` that was parameterized on the borrowed type.\n\n(cc @aturon)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "jonas-schievink", "id": 1786438, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY0Mzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786438?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonas-schievink", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30311/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30311/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
