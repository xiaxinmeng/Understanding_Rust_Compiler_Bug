Based on the existing doc, the method should return `None` as the index is out of bounds. But in reality: \r\n\r\n- Compile will fail if the index is const (i.e. known at compile time). \r\n- Will cause panic at runtime if the index is not const. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it is a good design if this method always returns `None` when the index is out of bounds, including negative ones. But either the doc should clarify or the implementation should be fixed.", "closed_by": {"login": "compiler-errors", "id": 3674314, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzQzMTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3674314?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors", "html_url": "https://github.com/compiler-errors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/96448/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/96448/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
