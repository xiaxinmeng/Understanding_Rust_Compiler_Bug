The problem is that they are displayed identically, which in my view is clearly confusing. \r\n\r\nA solution, if one is deemed necessary, will probably need some discussion. Could the trait bounds be included if and only if omitting them would result in duplicated entries in a section?", "closed_by": {"login": "Dylan-DPC", "id": 99973273, "node_id": "U_kgDOBfV4mQ", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99973273?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC", "html_url": "https://github.com/Dylan-DPC", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/72748/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/72748/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
