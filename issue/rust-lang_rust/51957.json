This seems like an obvious thing we should be linting against, but http://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=3e360c4ab4deb3ef9cc16b9c9a084f6e&version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2015 emits no warnings today.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this should be a new lint or part of the existing `overflowing_literals` lint. It obviously \"feels\" like the same sort of issue, and it's hard to imagine a situation where you'd want to allow/deny/forbid this and not the other kinds of `overflowing_literals`. But it's also clearly not \"overflowing\" in the usual sense of being an unrepresentable value greater than MAX or less than MIN, rather it's an unrepresentable value in-between multiple representable values.\r\n\r\n(thought of this when reading https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51534#issuecomment-396917857)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51957/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 5, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51957/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
