For example, according to http://llvm.org/releases/2.9/docs/CodeGenerator.html#x86, the x86 target uses address 256 to mean GS-relative addresses, and 257 to mean FS-relative addresses.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "graydon", "id": 14097, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDk3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14097?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon", "html_url": "https://github.com/graydon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4415/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4415/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
