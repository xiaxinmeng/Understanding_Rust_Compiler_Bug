introduced in `rustc_typeck::check::_match::check_match` that checks, via `MatchSource::IfDesugar`, whether an `if`-expression was desugared to `match` and if so, it requires that the scrutinee be typed at `bool`.\r\n\r\nWe might want to remove this hack in favor of a more principled solution, with options:\r\n\r\n1. Fix type ascription such that it admits coercions and then use `ExprKind::Type(...)` to set the expectation that the type be coercible to `bool`. This will require adjustments to diagnostics logic to reduce clutter.\r\n\r\n2. Use a cast `$scrutinee as bool` and use `ExprKind::Cast(...)` to set the expectation that the type be coercible to `bool`. Same applies wrt. diagnostics.\r\n\r\n3. Add a flag in the type ascription HIR that enables the \"coercion\" behavior we want. This is still a hack but potentially less of a hack.\r\n\r\n4. Remove the hack entirely and permit `if &true { ... }` to type check.\r\n\r\n   This is a semantic change to the language but perhaps a desirable one. I (@Centril) believe it would facilitate usability since there are cases where you call a function and end up with `&bool`, e.g. indexing a slice of `bool`s. Right now you would have to deref the returned `&bool` to make it work. I also think it is a semantic simplification of the language since `if` becomes more of a pure in-language desugaring than before. cc @rust-lang/lang about this idea of applying default-match-bindings to `if` conditions. \r\n\r\nFor more context, see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/59288#issuecomment-490970899 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/59288#pullrequestreview-233660158.", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60707/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60707/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "not_planned"}
