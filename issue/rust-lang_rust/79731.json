The implementation is not entirely trivial - we need an fd-permuting algorithm that avoids making unnecessary calls to `dup2`.\r\n\r\nOn Windows that would be `std::Process::Stdio::reuse<F:AsRawHandle>(fd: &f)` I guess.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame that we have totally separate names for `*RawFd` and `*RawHandle` rather than a portable-opaque but nonportably-transparent `OsOpenFileReference` type and `AsOsOpenFileReference`, `IntoOsOpenFileReference`, `FromOsOpenFileReference` but that seems like rather a major change.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79731/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79731/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
