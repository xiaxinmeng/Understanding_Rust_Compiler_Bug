A release build should be make the optimal compiler and develop should balance compile time, debug info, and optimisation.\n\n`--develop` should not be no-debug (i.e., include logging), should build jemalloc in debug mode, have all asserts on in llvm, should be an O2 build (I think, cc @epdtry), and should use parallel builds with 4 threads.\n\n`--release` should be no-debug (see #17496), should build release versions of jemalloc and llvm, should be O3, and should not use parallel builds.\n\nSetting any individual flags should override these settings.\n\nOpen questions: should `--develop` include debuginfo by default? (Does this even work at the moment, I know there have been bugs recently. cc @michaelwoerister)\n\nAre there other flags that should be set?\n\nCan we do this as proposed? I assume configure can set different defaults for make. (cc @alexcrichton)\n\nWhich should be the default? (Or should the user be forced to specify one or the other). I think @thestinger has made a good argument elsewhere that --release should be the default since it is more unfortunate if a packager makes a mistake than a developer.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/17665/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/17665/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
