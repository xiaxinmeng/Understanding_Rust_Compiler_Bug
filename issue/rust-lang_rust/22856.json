While linux/OS X binaries are available in `.tar.gz` form, and can be extracted into a temporary directory and have their `lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/` folder manually copied to `/usr/local/lib/rustlib`, getting the equivalent Windows binaries requires installing them onto a Windows machine and manually copying the files over. This situation would be made simpler if the `rustlib` folders were independently available for all targets.\n\nAs a second, broader issue, it would be nice to be able to install multiple targets into `rustlib` using `rustup.sh`, with something like `rustup.sh --target=x86_64-apple-darwin,x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`. This would be similar to Rust's configure script. This would make cross compilation and updating easier, since running rustup deletes any manually installed targets in `rustlib`.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22856/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22856/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
