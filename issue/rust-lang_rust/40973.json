Every other environment I've tried (including a local Windows VM) does not exhibit this problem.\r\n\r\nOn this one environment however, using `panic!` with `catch_unwind` and then Ruby's `rb_raise` twice successively causes a hard abort. It's a bit hard to explain, but you can see the code in action here: https://github.com/wagenet/rust_panic_test.\r\n\r\nIf I remove either the `panic!` or the `rb_raise` then the code runs cleanly. If I only call them each once, the code also exits cleanly.\r\n\r\nIt's not easy for me to tell if this is specifically a Rust or a Ruby issue.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40973/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40973/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
