Right now the typestate requires all structures to be fully defined before being passed to a function, so I'm finding myself having to write:\n\n```\ntype foo_t = { p: *ctypes::void, i: ctypes::c_int };\n\nnative mod foo {\n    fn f(foo: foo_t);\n}\n\nfn bar() {\n    let x = { p: ptr::null(), i: 0 as ctypes::c_int };\n    foo::f(x);\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nSince I'm passing raw pointers to c, it's naturally unsafe, so it'd be nice if we could allow `foo_t` to be opaque to the typestate system. What if we allow native module functions to have a flag saying they can initialize an uninitialized value? It'd help simplify binding to third party libraries.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "catamorphism", "id": 427212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzIxMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/427212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism", "html_url": "https://github.com/catamorphism", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1487/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1487/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
