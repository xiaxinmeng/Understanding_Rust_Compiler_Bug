Maybe even on CI? miri has a small test suite itself that exercises some bits on libstd, and that lets us find things like https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54908, but it's not very exhaustive and it doesn't seem like a good idea to duplicate all that.\r\n\r\nSo I think we should figure out a way to run the libstd tests in miri. Unfortunately I don't have a very good idea of what it would take.
