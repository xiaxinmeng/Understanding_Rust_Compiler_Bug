There are:\n- CreateSymbolicLinkW, only used by native::io::file::symlink()\n- GetFinalPathNameByHandleW, only used by native::io::file::readlink()\n\nAnd native::io::file::{symlink,readlink} are never used throughout the repo tree, except std::io::fs::{symlink,readlink} (which are really never used). \n\nDo we really need including symlink/readlink functionality inside std? How other languages do?\n\nCurrently Windows XP is still wildly used in the world, especially in Asia. Its installed volume is much more than Mac OS + Linux + Unix. We give up supporting XP just because of two api absent? Maybe it's wrong.\n\ncc #11950\n\n**update:** readlink is used by rustc::metadata::filesearch.\n\n**update:** This is my branch: https://github.com/liigo/rust/tree/xp \nI just commented out the usage of CreateSymbolicLinkW and GetFinalPathNameByHandleW. This make the new rustc.exe run successfully in Windows XP, ant it works mostly OK (see my latest comment below).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12842/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 5, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12842/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
