Mooted was that Windows allows later sockets to set the option and bind to endpoints which already have sockets without the option set, permitting a partial denial of service. (Later mitigated somewhat by SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE.) TcpListener::bind currently uses this option to ignore the TIME_WAIT state, allowing faster re-binding. This introduces more-or-less the same problem in exchange for a benefit that's probably more useful in development than production.\n\nThere are other platform variations which make it difficult to find a unifying interface, particularly for TCP. In lieu of such an interface, I'd suggest exposing setsockopt(2) - even from an obviously platform-specific namespace. My motivation is a multicast discovery protocol, where I'd like multiple agents on one machine to be able to see each other. As far as I can tell, I need to either handle this separately or reinvent much of the UdpSocket wheel - which would be a shame.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15835/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15835/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
