This is not great: if you want to test specific features you cannot do so. and also not all crates work with `--all-features` since features may be mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\n(B) You can do the following:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n/// \r\n/// ```\r\n/// # #[cfg(feature = \"foo)]\r\n/// # {\r\n///  ... doctest goes here ...\r\n/// # }\r\n/// ```\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, you're conditionally gating the test on the cfg. This works, but it has a major downside: the test will be reported as passing (as opposed to \"ignored\") in the `cargo test` output, which is misleading and not at all the behavior you want around tests. It's also hacky boilerplate that is necessary for a rather common task.\r\n\r\n`rustdoc` has access to cfg-parsing, it should be possible for it to compile-time-`ignore` tests based on a `cfg()` spec put on top of the code block.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93083/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93083/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
