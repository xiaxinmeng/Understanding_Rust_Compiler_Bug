When the code is compiled without optimization, it has a acceptable compile time (10+ seconds).\r\n\r\nThe array contains 130,000 + strs.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nI tried this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cargo build\r\n   Compiling alliteration-gen v0.1.0 (file:///<REDACTED>)\r\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 11.23 secs\r\n$ cargo build --release\r\n   Compiling alliteration-gen v0.1.0 (file:///<REDACTED>)\r\n^C\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected to see this happen: With the non-optimized code running in 11 seconds, the optimized one shouldn't take more than a few minutes.\r\n\r\nInstead, this happened: When i waited for it to compile, it took 10039.81 secs (2 hrs 47 mins).\r\n\r\nI replicated the problem again on a different Cargo project path and different machines and faced the same issue (didn't fully compile them as it would take very long. I waited for 5 minutes for each machine).\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\nMachines tested:\r\n\r\n1. Ubuntu 16.04 (Dell XPS 9360 Intel i5-7200U; 8GB RAM)\r\n2.
