I'm not sure what the opinion on this is exactly anyway. The idea came from [here](http://users.rust-lang.org/t/is-the-homepage-example-wrong-on-purpose/763). This error may come up very easily on [rust-lang.org](http://www.rust-lang.org/) and so is likely very noticeable. This:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = 0.0;\n    x += 1;\n}\n```\n\nGives this error:\n\n``` cmd\n<anon>:3:5: 3:6 error: binary assignment operation `+=` cannot be applied to types `_` and `_` [E0368]\n<anon>:3     x += 1;\n             ^\nerror: aborting due to previous error\nplaypen: application terminated with error code 101\n```\n\nThere are three issues, particularly to a new user (first time exploring `rust-lang.org`):\n- The distinction `0` and `0.0` may seem bizarre\n- Use of the mysterious type `_` will be puzzling and makes the error confusing\n- Comparing `_` and `_` makes it worse.\n\nIt would be ideal if `1` could be inferred to the type of `x` in this case. This would also avoid this confusing error on the rust main landing page.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bluss", "id": 3209739, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDk3Mzk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3209739?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss", "html_url": "https://github.com/bluss", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/23994/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/23994/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
