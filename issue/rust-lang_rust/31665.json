Without, I get normal response times.\n\nIf I watch the interface with tcpdump I can see dns request for the host each connection time.\n\nI've double checked the DNS records and while they have a relatively short TTL (5 mins) I don't feel that there should be subsequent requests.\n\nUsing Mac OS X\n", "closed_by": {"login": "jackh726", "id": 31162821, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTYyODIx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31162821?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726", "html_url": "https://github.com/jackh726", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jackh726/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31665/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31665/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
