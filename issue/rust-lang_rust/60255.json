I and others had to be told how to interact with this as a UI element. (I actually believed it to be a list-item marker like a *).\r\n\r\nThis ability to understand clearly that elements are firstly part of the UI, and second what their function is, is an important aspect in the psycholocy of design and human interaction.\r\n\r\nIn this case, to assist with humans being able to determine on visual inspection the behaviour of the \"[+]\", it may be better to \"document\" the behaviour with a change such as \"[+ expand]\" and \"[- collapse]\". Not only does this now clearly show that the elements have a purpose, it shows obviously what the purpose is. This also may not be a perfect suggestion, but I think that something about this element should be improved.\r\n\r\nI would propose that the element \"[+]\" be improved to more clearly indicate it's existence and operation to users.\r\n\r\nSee also original issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/60215", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60255/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60255/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
