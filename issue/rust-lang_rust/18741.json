It was a mess. But lo, they were severed and made two. Each could follow its own path. Overall, this is progress. But there is still room for improvement:\n1. The second half of \"operator dispatch\" is basically the same as `confirm::confirm`, but with some slight differences.\n2. The autoderef loop for `[]` is basically the same as `probe`, but with some slight differences (e.g., at each step it consists builtin `[]` as well).\n3. The `probe` loop, which uses `check::autoderef`, isn't able to be part of an inference transaction between `check::autoderef` uses operator dispatch which adds things into the main fulfillment context, thus leaking inference types etc outside the transaction.\n\nIt feels like things could still be cleaned up a bit further, allowing for more code reuse and happiness all around.\n\nSome FIXMEs are scattered about at relevant points of the code.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18741/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18741/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
