It may not be prudent to expose the implementation details of them and instead just call them something like `FastRng` and `CryptoRng`, to give us flexibility to change which algorithms are used in the future. On the other hand, an RNG like XorShift in particular has some peculiar properties that are implementation specifc, so it may be harder to replace.
