`Iterator::zip`, both to help people discover it and to help them decide when to use which.\r\n\r\nIt already has a `s1.iter().zip(s2);` example talking about `IntoIterator`, so maybe it would make sense to mention `iter::zip` in terms of when you want that on *both* sides, as `zip(s1, s2)`.\r\n\r\n*If you start working on this, please comment `@rustbot claim` to help avoid duplicate effort.*\r\n\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"cameron1024\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END
