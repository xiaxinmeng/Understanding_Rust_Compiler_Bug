https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49810.\r\n\r\nThe `Binder` type is used to represent higher-ranked regions:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/4b9b70c394e7f341b4016fce4cbf763d404b26f9/src/librustc/ty/sty.rs#L645-L653\r\n\r\nI have long wanted to make that field private and thus to force users of `Binder` to go through the more \"high-level\" methods (as an aside, it might be nice to move binder to its own module too, so that `ty` can't use its private fields).\r\n\r\nRight now, when we do `ty::Binder(value)`, that means that any things with a debruijn-index of 1 ([soon to be zero](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49813)) in `value` will be bound by this binder. Maybe we can add a `ty::Binder::bind(value)` for this. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are times when we do not expect `value` to have any bound regions in it -- for those cases we often use `ty::Binder(value)` today, but it'd be better if used `ty::Binder::dummy(value)`, which adds an assertion.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, any attempt to directly access the \"bound\" value (`binder.0`) is better written with `binder.skip_binder()`, which makes it more clear what's happening. Better yet is to add an accessor, somewhat like the `def_id` function defined on `Binder<TraitRef<'tcx>>`. This is currently written to access the field `0` directly, which is bad, but the good part is that it is \"safe\" to do, because `DefId` is a type that never contains a bound name:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/4b9b70c394e7f341b4016fce4cbf763d404b26f9/src/librustc/ty/sty.rs#L573-L575\r\n\r\nNote that accessing fields which *may* have bound names should ideally preserve the binding level, like the `inputs` function on `Binder<FnSig<'tcx>>`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/4b9b70c394e7f341b4016fce4cbf763d404b26f9/src/librustc/ty/sty.rs#L841-L843\r\n\r\nThis is saying, given a function like `for<'a> fn(&'a u32) -> &'a u32`, we get back a list of input types like `for<'a> [&'a u32]`. Note that the binder is preserved. (Internally, though, it could be rewritten to use the helper `Binder::map_bound`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/4b9b70c394e7f341b4016fce4cbf763d404b26f9/src/librustc/ty/sty.rs#L697-L701", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/49814/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/49814/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
