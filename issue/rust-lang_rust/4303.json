Even simply running \"rustc -v\" takes 5.8 seconds. During these operations, the CPU is 100% utilized and my system performs hardly any disk I/O. I have spare physical memory and no other tasks are hogging the CPU. I'm using a fresh install of the recommended MSYS version, and otherwise don't have any performance issues with the system; in comparison, \"g++ -v\" takes around a tenth of a second. The results are from several consecutive runs of the programs, and are very predictable.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "catamorphism", "id": 427212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzIxMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/427212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism", "html_url": "https://github.com/catamorphism", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4303/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4303/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
