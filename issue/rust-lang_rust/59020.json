I wrote this simple test code which demonstrates the issue:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::thread;\r\nuse std::time::Duration;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let t1 = thread::spawn(|| {\r\n        let sleep = Duration::new(0,100_000);\r\n        for _ in 0..100 {\r\n            println!(\"Parking1\");\r\n            thread::park_timeout(sleep);\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    let t2 = thread::spawn(|| {\r\n        let sleep = Duration::new(0,100_000);\r\n        for _ in 0..100 {\r\n            println!(\"Parking2\");\r\n            thread::park_timeout(sleep);\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    t1.join().expect(\"Couldn't join thread 1\");\r\n    t2.join().expect(\"Couldn't join thread 2\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Most* of the time it will only print this:\r\n```\r\nParking1\r\nParking2\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvery once in a while it will finish normally.  This behavior happens on stable and nightly and I tried a handfull of stable versions all the way back to 1.12 and they all got stuck.  Windows (both msvc and gnu appear to never get stuck (at least I couldn't reproduce the issue)).  I was able to duplicate this an another mac as well (both running 10.14)\r\n\r\nIf only a single thread is started (or the park happens on the main thread) then I can't reproduce.\r\n\r\nI'm on 10.14; uname: `Darwin 34363bc7dc9c 18.2.0 Darwin Kernel Version 18.2.0: Thu Dec 20 20:46:53 PST 2018; root:xnu-4903.241.1~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64 i386 MacBookPro11,3 Darwin`\r\n\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.33.0 (2aa4c46cf 2019-02-28)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 2aa4c46cfdd726e97360c2734835aa3515e8c858\r\ncommit-date: 2019-02-28\r\nhost: x86_64-apple-darwin\r\nrelease: 1.33.0\r\nLLVM version: 8.0\r\n```", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/59020/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/59020/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
