Once we've hit `1.0.0`, there's no better way to dogfood that stability than have the standard library a normal part of the Cargo ecosystem. The main benefit is that cross-compiling suddenly becomes a lot easier, especially for bare-metal targets: just use the normal `--target` with `cargo`. It also means that the answer to \"do I need to add a line to my `Cargo.toml`\" becomes a lot easier.\n\nCargo would inject references to `std` etc automatically, with an opt-out flag at the package level for things such as `zinc` or operating system kernels.\n\nBuilding `rustc` would become slightly more interesting, but would probably just involve juggling with the `PATH` so that Cargo is pointed at the right place.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "emberian", "id": 704250, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDI1MA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/704250?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian", "html_url": "https://github.com/emberian", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19240/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19240/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
