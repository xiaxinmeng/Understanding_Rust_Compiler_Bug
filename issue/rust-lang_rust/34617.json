Related: #29664.\n\nCreating a universal library for all iOS targets and linking it in XCode produces the following warnings when targeting a simulator, but not when targeting the real device:\n\n```\nld: warning: URGENT: building for iOS simulator, but linking in object file (/*/rusty/target/universal/debug/librusty.a(powidf2.c.o)) built for OSX.
