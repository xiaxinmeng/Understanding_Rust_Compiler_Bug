The simplest way to do this would be to do like GCC and Clang and implement a command line flag, but I think a better way to do this would be to create a `f32fast` and `f64fast` type that would then call the fast LLVM math functions. This way you can easily mix fast and \"slow\" floating point operations.\n\nI think this could be implemented as a library if LLVM assembly could be used in the `asm` macro.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21690/reactions", "total_count": 57, "+1": 49, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 5, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 3, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21690/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
