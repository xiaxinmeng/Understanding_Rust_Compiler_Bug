When loading a page with an unknown theme `rustdoc` will just leave the theme as the default `light` theme, which can result in suddenly been blinded if generally using a dark theme in a dark room.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the binding effect it would be good to have all builtin (and custom) themes classified into light or dark, and fallback to the base light/dark theme as appropriate when the exact theme requested is unknown. This will have to be implemented something like storing the classification into local-storage alongside the theme itself, since the rustdoc JS loading the theme will not know the theme to classify it itself.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can think of a plan that is backwards compatible with both pre-ayu rustdoc, and the current nightlies with ayu available, it'd be great if we can get this working across all versions on docs.rs somehow; but I doubt this is possible, so probably best to focus on just getting something that works on documentation generated going forward.", "closed_by": {"login": "GuillaumeGomez", "id": 3050060, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTAwNjA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3050060?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez", "html_url": "https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74937/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74937/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
