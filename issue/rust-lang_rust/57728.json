If a file is opened and _then_ a `println!()` is attempted, it silently writes into the file (which is probably not what was intended).\r\n\r\nExample 1:\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\nInvocation: `target/debug/hello-world >&-`\r\nExpected result: panic, with an error message relating to being unable to write to stdout, exit code 101\r\nObserved result: nothing (no output on stderr, exit code 0)\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let file = std::fs::File::create(\"foo\").unwrap();\r\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\r\n    drop(file);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nInvocation: `target/debug/hello-file >&-`\r\nExpected result: panic (as before), empty file `./foo`\r\nObserved result: no panic, `./foo` contains `Hello, world!`\r\n\r\nRust version: 1.30.0\r\nPlatform: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\n\r\nIt looks like any Rust program which is started with one or more closed stdio streams, opens a file (or socket, or\u2026), and subsequently tries to read|write said stdio stream will inadvertently read|write the file instead (messing up the seek position, not to mention causing data corruption). This seems like terribly bad behavior. ;-;", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57728/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57728/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
