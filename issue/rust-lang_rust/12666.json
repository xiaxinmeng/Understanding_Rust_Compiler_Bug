And to head off any concerns about my file handle limits:\n\n```\n$ ulimit\nunlimited\n```\n\nI ran into this when stress-testing my web sockets library. After just a couple hundred connections, some connections were being refused at random. The only thing I could see was some output with `RUST_LOG=debug` saying `(libuv) kqueue(): Too many open files`. I've come up with a smaller test case that brings this out with some spectacular errors:\n\n```\nuse std::io::net::tcp::{TcpListener, TcpStream};\nuse std::io::net::ip::{Ipv4Addr, SocketAddr};\nuse std::io::{Acceptor, Listener};\nuse std::io::IoResult;\n\nfn main() {\n    let addr = SocketAddr { ip: Ipv4Addr(127, 0, 0, 1), port: 8989 };\n    spawn(proc() {\n        let mut acceptor = TcpListener::bind(addr).listen();\n        loop {\n            let mut stream = match acceptor.accept() {\n                Ok(stream) => stream,\n                Err(error) => {\n                    debug!(\"accept failed: {:?}\", error);\n                    continue;\n                }\n            };\n            println!(\"{:?}\", stream.read_byte().unwrap());\n        }\n    });\n    for _ in range(0, 1000) {\n        spawn(proc() {\n            match TcpStream::connect(addr) {\n                Ok(stream) => {\n                    let mut stream = stream;\n                    stream.write([1]);\n                    let mut buf = [0];\n                    stream.read(buf);\n                },\n                Err(e) => debug!(\"{:?}\", e)\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFails less often with 100-200 connections. The errors are different every time I run this with `RUST_LOG=debug`.\n\nHere's the end of one run:\n\n```\n(libuv) kqueue(): Too many open files\nbug(54921,0x10881c000) malloc: *** error for object 0x7fca4b620f70: pointer being freed was not allocated\n*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug\nstd::io::IoError{kind: OtherIoError, desc: \"too many open files\", detail: None}\ntask '<unnamed>' failed at 'assertion failed: `(left == right) && (right == left)` (left: `140506823655696`, right: `140506824839680`)', /Users/harish/rust/rust/src/librustuv/homing.rs:110\n(libuv) kqueue(): Too many open files\nstd::io::IoError{kind: OtherIoError, desc: \"too many open files\", detail: None}\ntask '<unnamed>' failed at 'didnt want an unwind during: going home', /Users/harish/rust/rust/src/librustuv/lib.rs:199\nAbort trap: 6\n```\n\nAnother:\n\n```\ntask '<unnamed>' failed at 'didnt want an unwind during: going home', /Users/harish/rust/rust/src/librustuv/lib.rs:199\ntask failed during unwinding (double-failure - total drag!)\nrust must abort now. so sorry.\nSegmentation fault: 11\n```\n\nAnother:\n\n```\ntask '<unnamed>' failed at 'didnt want an unwind during: going home', /Users/harish/rust/rust/src/librustuv/lib.rs:199\ntask failed during unwinding (double-failure - total drag!)\nrust must abort now. so sorry.\nIllegal instruction: 4\n```\n\nAnd lastly:\n\n```\nfatal runtime error: leaked managed memory (140518327703008 objects)\n(libuv) kqueue(): Too many open files\ntask '<unnamed>' failed at 'didnt want an unwind during: going home', /Users/harish/rust/rust/src/librustuv/lib.rs:Abort trap: 6\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12666/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12666/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
