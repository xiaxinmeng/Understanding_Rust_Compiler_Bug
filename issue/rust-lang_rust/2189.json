My reasons:\n- The language will have that many fewer keywords and syntactic constructs.\n- The semantics are incompatible with closures.  Right now, if I write `foo(_, f())` this evaluates `f()` right away and binds the result into the closure.  This is quite different from `{|x| foo(x, f())}` which is surprising.  This has led to bugs.\n- The type system is complex enough.  Bind is a weird corner case we tend to forget about.  We already found one such problem (move mode arguments) and I am confident there are more lurking.  Let's simplify our lives and only think about closures, which are hard enough.\n\nAs a side effect of this change, naming a method like `a.b` without calling it will presumably become an error.  \n", "closed_by": {"login": "msullivan", "id": 340349, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDM0OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340349?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan", "html_url": "https://github.com/msullivan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2189/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2189/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
