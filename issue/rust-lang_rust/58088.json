Currently rustc will print errors like this:\r\n```shell\r\nerror[E0609]: no field `name` on type `&mut std::rc::Rc<std::cell::RefCell<State>>`\r\n  --> src/main.rs:68:10\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that the source file in question has:\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\r\nuse std::rc::Rc;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error could look like this:\r\n```shell\r\nerror[E0609]: no field `name` on type `&mut Rc<RefCell<State>>`\r\n  --> src/main.rs:68:10\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the example above is pretty trivial, but we all know how unwieldy and unreadable error messages can get, and I think any chance to shave off some text and make it brief and readable should be taken. \r\n\r\nOne could fear that it might be harder to figure out the exact constructs referred to, but given that errors are against code the dev wrote, and the dev uses these shortcuts through `use` I think that in practice this should be preferred in almost all cases. In the worst case the dev has to look at their own code to know what modules errors refer to.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I can't promise that I could provide a pull request implementing this since I have never hacked on rustc and I have limited time available, but if the fundamental idea is appreciated and someone is willing to seriously mentor a complete beginner in rustc dev, I would be up for trying. I will have time to develop between mid febuari and mid april.", "closed_by": {"login": "estebank", "id": 1606434, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY0MzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1606434?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank", "html_url": "https://github.com/estebank", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58088/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58088/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
