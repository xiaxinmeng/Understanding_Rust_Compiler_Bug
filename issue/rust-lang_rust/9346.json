However, this leads to some annoying duplication, especially when defining a static struct instance. For example, from `extra::base64`:\n\n``` rust\npub static STANDARD: Config =\n    Config {char_set: Standard, pad: true, line_length: None};\n```\n\nThere's no ambiguity in the type of the RHS, but the LHS must repeat the type anyways.\n\nWould it be possible/reasonable to infer the type of statics from the RHS of the assignment where possible? Things like this would be work:\n\n``` rust\npub static STANDARD =\n    Config {char_set: Standard, pad: true, line_length: None};\n\npub static HELLO = \"hello, world!\";\n\npub static HELLO_BYTES = bytes!(\"hello, world!\");\n\npub static BAR = 18u8;\n```\n\nbut \n\n``` rust\npub static BAZ = 10;\n```\n\nwould not since the type isn't specified (or maybe it would resolve to `int`?). Untyped integer literals and generic types containing them are actually the only things I can think of that would require a type annotation.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "rust-highfive", "id": 7378925, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjczNzg5MjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7378925?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-highfive", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9346/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9346/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
