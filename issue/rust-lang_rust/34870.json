Beyond that, the page on [lifetimes](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/lifetimes.html) has a few other issues and appears generally harder to follow\u2014while I could follow everything up to https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/references-and-borrowing.html on a first read, this was much more confusing.\n\nI understand that topologically sorting topics in dependency order is hard (because there are often cycles), but part of the discussion of lifetimes could be done assuming only knowledge of functions (and possibly generics). That includes lifetime elision, most of the examples in the \"Examples\" section, the `'static` lifetime\u2014those can be explained without using structs or methods.\n\nThe second big topic in here seems about lifetime-polymorphic structures, but I don't get that yet fully\u2014I guess the text could elaborate more on this point, with some concrete example:\n\n> So why do we need a lifetime here? We need to ensure that any reference to a Foo cannot outlive the reference to an i32 it contains.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34870/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34870/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
