The basic idea is to make a new crate, `rt`, that depends on core, and all the scheduler, task, pipes, etc. code lives there. `core` contains modules for the primitive types, containers and a few other things.\n\nThis would mostly be an organizational change. Beyond freeing some niche users from linking to `rt` it doesn't really enable any new functionality. What it does is make a clear delineation between code that is tied to the scheduler and code that isn't.\n\nBy default, crates would link to both `core` and `rt` (as they now link to `core` and `rustrt`).\n\nThere aren't any significant technical obstacles that I know of, but it will require thinking about how `task` and `comm` fit into the prelude. Does the prelude live in `rt`? Do we just not put task and comm in the prelude?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/5157/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/5157/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
