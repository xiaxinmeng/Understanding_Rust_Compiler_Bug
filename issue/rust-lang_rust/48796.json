Most likely for the 2018 epoch the former will only be the keyword lint, and all the other lints will be idiom lints.\r\n\r\nI wonder if we should be providing a lint group for just the \"breaking change\" lints as well, so that people can get code _working_ on the new epoch easily (running tons of lints increases the chance of cases where e.g. two lints try to modify the same area of code, so only one works -- we can't completely automate rustfix when there's a high concentration of lints).\r\n\r\nHaving lints in multiple groups is a bit broken in rustc IIRC so we may need to be careful about this.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, we may need a way to say `-Awarnings -Wepoch_2018` -- currently `-Awarnings` turns off all warnings period, and cannot be overridden (you can do `-Depoch_2018` to make those lints work)\r\n\r\ncc @nikomatsakis ", "closed_by": {"login": "Manishearth", "id": 1617736, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc3MzY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1617736?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth", "html_url": "https://github.com/Manishearth", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48796/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48796/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
