`#![feature(relaxed_struct_unsize)]`.\r\n\r\nThis features changes the when a struct implements `Unsize` which\r\nis required for unsize coercion.\r\n\r\nA generic struct previously implemented `Unsize` if and only if:\r\n- the tail field depends on at least one type or const parameter\r\n- **all type and const parameters used in the last field must only be used in the last field**\r\n- the target struct can be created from the source by replacing only the parameters found in the last struct field\r\n- the tail field implements `Unsize` from source to target\r\n\r\nWith this feature gate the requirements are changed to:\r\n- the tail field depends on at least one type or const parameter **not used in any other field**\r\n- the target struct can be created from the source by replacing only the parameters **only** found in the last struct field\r\n- the tail field implements `Unsize` from source to target\r\n\r\n### About tracking issues\r\n\r\nTracking issues are used to record the overall progress of implementation.\r\nThey are also used as hubs connecting to other relevant issues, e.g., bugs or open design questions.\r\nA tracking issue is however *not* meant for large scale discussion, questions, or bug reports about a feature.\r\nInstead, open a dedicated issue for the specific matter and add the relevant feature gate label.\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n\r\n- [ ] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][doc-guide])\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][stabilization-guide])\r\n\r\n[stabilization-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr\r\n[doc-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#documentation-prs\r\n\r\n### Implementation history\r\n\r\nThis feature has been implemented in #80726\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url":
