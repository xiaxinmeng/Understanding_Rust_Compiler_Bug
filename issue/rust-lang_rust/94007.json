I think closing this is also reasonable.\r\n\r\nWhen `RUSTFLAGS_BOOTSTRAP`/`RUSTFLAGS_NOT_BOOSTRAP` is passed to to `x.py` (gets picked up [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/c5c610aad0a012a9228ecb83cc19e77111a52140/src/bootstrap/builder.rs#L1028-L1037)), those variables are forwarded as `RUSTFLAGS` here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/c5c610aad0a012a9228ecb83cc19e77111a52140/src/bootstrap/builder.rs#L1856\r\n\r\nThis works most of the time. However, there is a known bug in Cargo (rust-lang/cargo#5754 / rust-lang/cargo#4423) that makes it so that if `--target` is passed to a `cargo` invocation, even if the passed triple is the same as the host triple, `RUSTFLAGS` is _not_ passed to build scripts. And since bootstrap _always_ passes `--target`, `RUSTFLAGS_*_BOOTSTRAP` do not take effect for builds scripts:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/c5c610aad0a012a9228ecb83cc19e77111a52140/src/bootstrap/builder.rs#L1001\r\n\r\nThis is problematic when `RUSTFLAGS` includes arguments that are critical to building, most notably in the form of `-Clink-arg`s without which any attempt to link may fail.\r\n\r\nThere isn't an obvious fix to the problem beyond fixing the upstream problem(s) in Cargo. One possibility is to detect when `target == host` in the bootstrap logic and avoid passing `--target` to `cargo` in that instance. That way build scripts will respect `RUSTFLAGS` again, though it may still pose a problem for cross-compiling use-cases, I'm not sure?\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.58.1 (db9d1b20b 2022-01-20)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: db9d1b20bba1968c1ec1fc49616d4742c1725b4b\r\ncommit-date: 2022-01-20\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.58.1\r\nLLVM version: 13.0.0\r\n```", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94007/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94007/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
