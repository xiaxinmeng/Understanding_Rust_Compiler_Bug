No one objected, several people agreed.]\n\nAt least two people have confused @T with a boxed type in the past\nweeks. Even me, who really should know better at this point,\noccasionally misinterpret some code because of the similarity between\nthe two. The same probably goes for ~T.\n\nI think we should change the syntax. It can be a little more verbose,\nI think, as long as it doesn't resemble other type-related syntax.\n\nI'd also support making 'shared' the default kind for type parameters.\nIt is usually what you want.\n\nProposal: 'pinned T' and 'unique T' for pinned/unique type params. 'T'\nfor shared ones.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "marijnh", "id": 144427, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144427?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh", "html_url": "https://github.com/marijnh", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1067/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1067/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
