I'd like be able to show the same information by opening up a browser to the installed docs.\n\nCan we find a way to generate both the man pages and new HTML versions of the command line documentation from the same source? We probably don't want to take a new pandoc dependency. Perhaps we can just write something in Rust to do it.\n\nAlternately, we could create HTML documentation for each of the command line tools. In the future we're going to be distributing more command line tools. They'll need to be documented in HTML.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34607/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34607/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
