The primary usage of `forget` that still makes sense is for panic guards, but using `forget` has the disadvantage of being unclear in its intent. Removing `forget` would probably make panic guards clearer as they would encourage writing a comment or seperate method explaining what's happening.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103101/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103101/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
