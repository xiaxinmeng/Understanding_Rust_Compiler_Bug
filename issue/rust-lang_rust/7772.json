There's a few different kinds of aborts, such as `fatal runtime error: assertion failed: void_sched.is_not_null()` or `error opening /dev/urandom: Too many open files`, but they all seem to be caused by running out of file descriptors. The default limit on my machine (OS X) is 256, and if I catch the abort (with `lldb`) I can see that they're all in use.\n\nThis problem seems to have been triggered by 8afec77cb, which was introduced into master by PR #7265. This commit changes the default number of concurrent test threads from `4` to `rust_get_num_cpus() * 2`. Experimentally, anything above `6` causes the test failure, and my machine reports 8 CPUs so the test suite is attempting to use 16 threads.\n\nI don't know what the root cause here is; either we're keeping fds open much longer than we should, or we have a bunch of tests that require a lot of fds, or maybe something completely different. Interestingly, `lsof` reports that most of the fds in use are PIPEs. What do we use pipes for?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7772/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7772/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
