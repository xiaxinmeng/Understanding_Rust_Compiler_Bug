its payload.  This requires hashtable lookups on malloc/free and seems inefficient.  However, to do cycle collection or any form of GC, boxes DO need to be self-describing.  Therefore, I propose we layout a box like this:\n\n```\nstruct box {\n    tydesc *desc;\n    int refcnt;\n    <payload>\n}\n```\n\nThis has a few advantages:\n- no more map lookups on alloc, free; also memory consumption is surely lower\n- the desc and refcnt are always at known offsets, regardless of the alignment of payload\n- we can unify the paths for opaque types like closures, objects, and ifaces.  They should also begin with a type descriptor.\n\nI think it would be best if the type descriptor describes the _entire_ box (including the desc and refcnt fields). The reason is that this avoids the need to consider the alignment of payload when finding the offset of the data described by the type descriptor.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1493/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1493/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
