The keywords `pub`, and `const` appear next to the name of the constant, when clearly they are redundant.\n2. Accessing the constants page through search brings the user to an empty page.\n3. The value assigned to the constant appears along side its name.\n   When reading the documentation of constants, the most important information is the name of the constant and its description. Having the declaration appear inline makes scanning for the name of harder.\n\nBetter output would replace the declaration with the name of the constant followed by its type.\nAlso it would move the declaration of the constant to the empty page mentioned in point 2 and have the identifier of the constant link to this page.\n\nAll these points are relevant for statics as well.\n\n**Example of ugly output:**\n![rustdoc-constants-ugly](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4515029/5077393/99f39472-6eee-11e4-8a19-a29e253a4e68.png)\n\n**This page should show the definition and a description of the constant:**\n![rustdoc-constans-empty](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4515029/5077626/fa3a91a8-6ef0-11e4-8505-258db2f24532.png)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19046/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19046/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
