To properly account for function pointers having a different address space, they need to be added in the `Pointer` variant of [the `Primitive` ABI type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_abi/enum.Primitive.html). That is the only way to fix types like `Result<&i32, fn()>`, which are currently going horribly wrong for Harvard architectures because the enum layout algorithm will think that `&i32` and `fn()` are exactly the same fundamental type, and put them into one and the same field (resulting LLVM layout: `{ i64, ptr }`).\r\n\r\nNot sure whom to ping here, so I will pick some people that seem to be active in an around AVR: @dylanmckay @Patryk27.\r\nAlso Cc @rust-lang/compiler since this is related to some pretty fundamental compiler infrastructure", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/106367/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/106367/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
