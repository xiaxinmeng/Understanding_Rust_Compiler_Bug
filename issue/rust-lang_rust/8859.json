Note that it calls VirtualQuery once and VirtualProtect twice per relocated address, so no wonder it's slow!\n\nThis is the first time I'm coming across pseudo-relocations.  Does anybody here know what exactly they are, and why does librustc have so many of them?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "vadimcn", "id": 3203809, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDM4MDk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3203809?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn", "html_url": "https://github.com/vadimcn", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8859/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8859/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
