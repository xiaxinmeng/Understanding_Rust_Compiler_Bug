The issue also occurs if using `match`, or when using the `box_patterns` feature. However, this clearly should be legal to do.\n\nThe following code also breaks in a similar way, but with a different error message (\"use of collaterally moved value: `(x:X::A).1`\"; which is not even mentioned by `--explain E0382`):\n\n``` rust\nenum X {\n    A(String, Box<X>),\n    C,\n}\n\nfn foo(x: Box<X>) {\n    if let X::A(a, b) = *x {\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt was pointed out on IRC that this can be worked around by writing `{*x}` instead of `*x`, but that's not particularly satisfactory. Someone then said that this was likely a bug with the deref-move special case for `Box`, where it doesn't handle partial moves correctly.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "apasel422", "id": 8644784, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg2NDQ3ODQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8644784?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/apasel422", "html_url": "https://github.com/apasel422", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apasel422/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apasel422/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apasel422/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apasel422/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apasel422/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apasel422/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apasel422/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apasel422/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apasel422/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34859/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34859/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
