As expected, I get an error:\n\n```\nfeature_gated.rs:3:5: 3:10 error: box expression syntax is experimental; you can call `Box::new` instead. (see issue #27779)\nfeature_gated.rs:3     box 2;\n                       ^~~~~\nfeature_gated.rs:3:5: 3:10 help: add #![feature(box_syntax)] to the crate attributes to enable\n```\n\nAn easy mistake to make is to misunderstand \"crate attributes\" and add the suggested feature attribute to the top of the current file instead.  The problem is that if I do so, rustc doesn't tell me what I did wrong: it just seems to silently ignore the attribute.\n\nIn fact, there is a lint that triggers on the attribute:\n\n```\nfeature_gated.rs:1:1: 1:24 warning: crate-level attribute should be in the root module, #[warn(unused_attributes)] on by default\nfeature_gated.rs:1 #![feature(box_syntax)]\n```\n\n...but it only shows up if I remove the gated syntax to allow compilation to proceed to that phase.  This doesn't help someone stuck on the original error.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31881/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31881/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
