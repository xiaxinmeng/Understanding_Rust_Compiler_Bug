This was a surprise to myself and a number of other experienced embedded-rust folks.\r\n\r\nThis was tested with stable rust 1.59, but I wanted to check (with the lang/libs teams?) whether this is:\r\n\r\n* Intended, and the docs (not sure exactly which ones) should be updated/clarified\r\n* Unintended, and this may need to be fixed\r\n\r\nAt this point, I'm also not sure if this generalizes to desktop programs in `panic = \"abort\"`, but in that case, it may be a soundness issue if folks had not considered their panic handlers to be re-entrant safe (though that's probably just the `std` panic handler in almost every case anyway).", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97146/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 6, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97146/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
