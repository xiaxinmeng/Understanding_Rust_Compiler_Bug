However, I run docker under user namespace, which disables support for `--privileged`. The run script fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./src/ci/docker/run.sh x86_64-gnu\r\n... <A lot of output> ...\r\nSuccessfully built 2a8488e739aa\r\nSuccessfully tagged rust-ci:latest\r\ndocker: Error response from daemon: privileged mode is incompatible with user namespaces.  You must run the container in the host namespace when running privileged mode.\r\nSee 'docker run --help'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to have some limited mode of the tests that would skip the parts needing the extra syscalls (mentioned [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/ci/docker/run.sh#L114)) and conditionally disable the privileged mode? Or would it be too much work with very little benefit?\r\n\r\nThis is on a yesterday's master (01cc982e936120acb0424e41de14e42ba2d88c6f).", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51776/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51776/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
