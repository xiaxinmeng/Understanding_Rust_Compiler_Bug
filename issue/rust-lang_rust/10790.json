It takes all my memory (8GB RAM, with a few things running, but not really much) and then started to swap (another 8GB then my disk was full).\n\nWhen I `ps aux` I can see more and more processes called `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/test/run-pass/issue-10626.stage2-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` spinning up. The highest number I saw before it got very unresponsive was around 2800 processes.\n\nAll this was a `make check` on a recent master `69186efc199d48afca9427e448363212b0a59454`. I had one of my own commits on top of that, but I really don't think that commit can cause this issue (I currently rerun with a clean master though).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10790/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10790/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
