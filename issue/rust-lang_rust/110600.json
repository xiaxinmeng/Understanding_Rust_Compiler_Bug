Eventually found it by just commenting out lines one at a time. The MRE from above is also available on in a repo [here](https://github.com/c-git/leetcode/blob/e65a012aa993d1d686267bca697f6fd50877f74a/rust/src/main.rs).\n\n### Other cases\n\n```Rust\n#[derive(Default)]\r\nstruct Node {\r\n    value: i32,\r\n    children: Vec<Node>,\r\n}\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let values: Vec<i32> = vec![];\r\n    let mut root: Node = Default::default();\r\n    let mut current_node = &mut root;\r\n\r\n    'outer: for value in values {\r\n        for (i, element) in current_node.children.iter_mut().enumerate() {\r\n            if element.value == value {\r\n                current_node = &mut current_node.children[i]; // This one works                \r\n                continue 'outer;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nDidn't test on other versions of the compiler, I can do if that would be helpful.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110600/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110600/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
