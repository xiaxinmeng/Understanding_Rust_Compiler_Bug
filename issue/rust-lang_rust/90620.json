Tracking issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44839\r\n\r\nThis came about as a result of the discussion on stabilising the aarch64 runtime feature detection macro: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86941\r\n\r\nStabilisation PR: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/90621\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nAlong with [`std::is_aarch64_feature_detected!`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86941), we'd like to stabilise `aarch64_target_feature`. This allows using the `target_feature` attribute on aarch64 platforms like such:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#[target_feature(enable = \"neon\")]\r\nunsafe fn asimd_code() {\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows for unconditional code generation - the above function will be compiled as if assumed to only run on hosts that support the `neon` feature.\r\n\r\nNote that this differs from compile-time feature detection (via `cfg!`) and run-time feature detection (via the `std::is_aarch64_feature_detected!` macro).\r\n\r\n### Test cases\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of x86_64 tests in place testing the behaviour of the `target_feature` attribute. Since this proposal does not change the behaviour of `target_feature`, only stabilises some of its inputs, I do not believe there's any pressing need to update these tests.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nI've updated the Rust reference: https://github.com/rust-lang/reference/pull/1102\r\n\r\n### Unresolved questions\r\n\r\nIt's possible in the future that `PAuth` will have reason to be split into two separate features (`paca` and `pacg` in Linux's `AT_HWCAP`. If this happens the plan would be to add two new `target_feature` options and, if necessary, keep PAuth as the combination of the two. It doesn't make sense to pre-emptively separate them before they're separate in LLVM, nor keep `PAuth` unstable for an undetermined amount of time.\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "adamgemmell", "id": 3757567, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTc1Njc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3757567?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamgemmell", "html_url": "https://github.com/adamgemmell", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamgemmell/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamgemmell/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamgemmell/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamgemmell/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamgemmell/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamgemmell/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamgemmell/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamgemmell/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamgemmell/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90620/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90620/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
