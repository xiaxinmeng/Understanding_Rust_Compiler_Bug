If there's a better place to discuss similar suggestions, please tell me._\n\nI was just playing with Rust on http://rustbyexample.com/, and I've accidentally discovered that writeln can be called without a semicolon.\nIt doesn't look like a big deal, but for a perfectionist like me, I see it as a consistency flaw, especially for (probably) the most common macro in the language.\n\nThe author of **Rust by example** explained what's going on [here](https://github.com/japaric/rust-by-example/issues/183), but that doesn't look right to me. Even C has a do-while(0) hack for this case.\n\n[This](http://is.gd/ajFYN1) is an expanded `println!(\"test\")`. The `match` looks very similar to the do-while(0) C hack for macros, and I think that it's the wrong way to do it, not only because it looks and feels like a hack, but also because it behaves differently than a native Rust function. For example, `println!(\"test\") println!(\"test\")` compiles, while `returns_unit() returns_unit()` doesn't.\n\nMy proposal: use a self-calling function, similar to what [JavaScript allows](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/592396/what-is-the-purpose-of-a-self-executing-function-in-javascript). I don't know whether it's currently possible in Rust, but if not, I think it could be a natural addition to the language. [Here's](http://is.gd/CZ7Y8u) how I expect it to look, more or less.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15854/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15854/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
