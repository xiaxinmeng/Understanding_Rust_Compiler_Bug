a function: one generic and one with the actual implementation. For example, `Error::new()` immediately delegates to a non-generic function `_new()`:\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5565241f65cf402c3dbcb55dd492f172c473d4ce/library/std/src/io/error.rs#L250-L260\r\n\r\nThis benefits both compile- and run-time: compiletime because LLVM has to do less work compiling the large implementation of the function body many times, and runtime because generic version can safely be marked as `#[inline]` without bloating the instruction cache.\r\n\r\nHowever, most libraries do not do this, for the simple reason that it's tedious and annoying to do (and you have to already know about it). It would be amazing if rustc could do this transformation itself. I expect this would help greatly with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65031, as well as compile times across the ecosystem.\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"jumbatm\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77960/reactions", "total_count": 43, "+1": 37, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 6, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77960/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
