Visit a doc page with a large source page, like https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/slice/struct.Iter.html or https://docs.rs/log/0.4.14/log/.\r\n2. Click any `[src]` link on the page.\r\n3. Browser shows part of the page, and then hangs. Eventually the OS pops up an \"app not responding\" dialog.\r\n\r\nI've reproduced this on both Chrome and Brave, on a physical Android device. I've tried to reproduce this in Chrome on desktop, and it doesn't hang. What's odd is, it's not even slow on desktop!\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this has something to do with the large number of DOM elements: minimum two per line. One useful experiment would be to count the DOM elements, and create a synthetic page with no JSS and no CSS, just that many DOM elements, and see if it hangs those browsers. The issue doesn't reproduce on smaller source pages.", "closed_by": {"login": "jsha", "id": 220205, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/220205?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha", "html_url": "https://github.com/jsha", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84686/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84686/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
