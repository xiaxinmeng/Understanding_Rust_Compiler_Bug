Irrespective of any misconceptions or lack of knowledge that might have factored in that specific person's confusion, this message does seem to use very strange terminology. Types, as opposed to values, don't really _live_ (it's occasionally convenient to make puns about this, but in this case it hurts), and it's not really a question of how long a value of type `T` lives but rather of lifetime parameters contained in `T`. Also, \"parameter type\" looks odd &mdash; \"type parameter\" seems much more common.\n\nI'd suggest something like\n\n> error: values of type `T` may contain data that does not live long enough\n\nThe exact wording is just a straw man, I don't think it's optimal.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36700/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36700/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
