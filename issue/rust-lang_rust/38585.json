modules like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub mod myMod {\r\n    pub use super::*;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere if crate A defines a module like that, attempting to use it in crate B will cause rustc and rustdoc to choke.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I can't provide any compiler output for this, because it technically did not crash, but I did get the thread stack using Process Explorer.\r\n\r\nHere is the process info when I decided to kill the process:\r\n![perf](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4708645/21464417/4e686ece-c941-11e6-81ad-ad032e269aed.PNG)\r\n\r\nAnd here is the stack trace where it seems to copy new memory:\r\n![stack](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4708645/21464422/74073c32-c941-11e6-9f5c-ba0395c7801d.PNG)\r\n\r\n`rustc_resolve` seems to crop up often as I refreshed the stack view.\r\n\r\nI can't reproduce this with a short piece of code, because the resolution stuff is tied into the project, but I can show you exactly what happened in my code to produce this effect.\r\n\r\nBasically, I'm writing an OpenAL wrapper, and attempting to refer to `GLuint` rather than `ALuint` causes the bug. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```rust\r\nunsafe fn run() -> ALResult<()> {\r\n    let sample_rate: GLuint = 44_100;\r\n    let freq: GLuint = 600;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    unsafe {\r\n        run().unwrap();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould give an error that `GLuint` is not found, because it was a typo on my part, but instead it seems to soft-fail exhaustively resolving `GLuint`\r\n\r\nIf I correct my typo to `ALuint`, it compiles instantly with minimal memory usage.\r\n\r\n## Meta\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.15.0-nightly (71c06a56a 2016-12-18)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash:
