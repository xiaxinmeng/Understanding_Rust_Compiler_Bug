Many operations are described in terms of overflowing (e.g. `checked_sub` for unsigned types) even if they cannot ever overflow.\r\n\r\nThis would be a minor change (would love to do it myself as a first contribution!) but I am curious to know whether this is an oversight, or whether \"underflow\" is simply not differentiated from \"overflow\" in the documentation (and do we ever want to specify those differently)?", "closed_by": {"login": "lesurp", "id": 12513150, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTEzMTUw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12513150?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lesurp", "html_url": "https://github.com/lesurp", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lesurp/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lesurp/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lesurp/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lesurp/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lesurp/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lesurp/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lesurp/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lesurp/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lesurp/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108305/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108305/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
