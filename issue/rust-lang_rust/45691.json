I eventually figured out that they were from:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub trait ToCss {\r\n    /// Serialize `self` in CSS syntax, writing to `dest`.\r\n    fn to_css<W>(&self, dest: &mut W) -> fmt::Result where W: Write;\r\n    // ...other things elided\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand implementations of said trait.  But that's still not much help, because I can't figure out without a lot of tedium which specializations of `W` are producing which of the above symbols.\r\n\r\nI realize C++ symbol names are often long and gross, but they nearly always include enough information to tell you exactly what code you should be looking at.  Symbols from `rustc` often leave out important bits of information, which makes some forms of analysis much more difficult than they ought to be.  (You could, if you were so inclined, get some of this information from debug info, but trawling through debug info is its own brand of tedium.)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45691/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45691/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
