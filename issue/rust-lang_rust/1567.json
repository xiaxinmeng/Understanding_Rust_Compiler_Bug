I think we should make them resemble closures more closely both in the language and implementation as follows:\n- Make interface instance two words: `(vtable, data)` (analogous to a closure's (fptr, data))\n- Model a vtable with one entry as a single function pointer\n- Use type bounds after the iface name to indicate how the data is stored (& vs @ vs ~)\n\nTherefore, for an iface `X`, the type:\n- `X` indicates any interface instance  Such a closure cannot be copied, just as `fn` cannot be copied\n- `X&`indicates an interface instance whose data is located on the stack.\n- `X@` indicates an interface instance whose data is boxed\n- `X~` indicates an interface instance whose data is sendable and stored via unique ptr\n\nAdvantages:\n- More analogous.\n- `X~` instances can be sent\n- `X&` instances are particularly cheap to construct\n- Closures are a special case of an interface instance (one with a single method), in the impl at least.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1567/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1567/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
