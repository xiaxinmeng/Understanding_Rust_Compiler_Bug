Specifically, `ld.bfd` and `ld.gold` will munge sections to deal with the presence of both `.ctors` and `.init_array` in the same binary; `lld` will not.\r\n\r\nRust is currently implicitly using the deprecated `.ctors` section in its output format, because we don't explicitly set `Options.UseInitArray = true;`. Clang does this via some autodetect logic because it supports legacy platforms for which their other compilers do not have `.init_array` support (gcc < 4.7), but looking through Rust's supported platforms it doesn't *appear* that we have any platforms with compilers that old, so we can likely just set this true.\r\n\r\nI'll upload a patch shortly which sets us to use `.init_array` unconditionally. If we find any platforms we support that may want to use `.ctors`, we can add this as a platform attribute similar to other arguments to `LLVMRustCreateTargetMachine`, and possibly pass `-fno-use-init-array` if clang is in use to `profile_builtins`'s `build.rs` for those platforms which don't support `.init_array` (this shouldn't be needed if clang's autodetect is working correctly).\r\n\r\nLinking #39915 to this issue in case someone has been having similar problems.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/71233/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/71233/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
