It's also annoying to write during debugging.\n\nWhy not overload the macros so that `println!(expr)` is an alias for `println!(\"{}\", expr)`? This won't break any current behavior, but it will turn an error into something useful.\n\nI have a possible fix on [this branch](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust/compare/easyprint?expand=1), though eddyb suggested I try to make the changes in `format_args!` itself. (I'm not so familiar with that code, so I'd prefer to get feedback here before working on that.)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Manishearth", "id": 1617736, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc3MzY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1617736?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth", "html_url": "https://github.com/Manishearth", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13504/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13504/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
