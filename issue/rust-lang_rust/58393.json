It will work as expected, printing `foo`.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `foo-*.d` doesn't contain anything to do with libfoo.a, which is obviously a dependency. One consequence of this is that sccache relies on this dep-info for its caching, and changes to libfoo.a are completely ignored. One real-world consequence is that on Firefox CI, jobs that build C/C++ code with clang 3.9 still get a libgkrust.a where C code was built with clang 7 (and vice-versa, depending which cached first).\r\n\r\nCc: @alexcrichton @luser @froydnj ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58393/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58393/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
