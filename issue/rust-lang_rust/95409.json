one of the libraries I am working on and found that its performance has regressed by roughly 50%.\r\n\r\nSince there have not been any changes to the code since I checked last time I was confused about this.\r\nI bisected `rustc` versions until I found the version where the regression started: `nightly-2022-03-05`\r\n`nightly-2022-03-03` was still fine.\r\nThe problem persists in the most recent Rust nighty: `nightly-2022-03-28`\r\n\r\nThe project that experiences the severe performance regression is [wasmi: WebAssembly Interpreter](https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi).\r\nI ran benchmarks using:\r\n```\r\ncargo bench\r\n```\r\nIn particular (faster results than running the entire suite)\r\n```\r\ncargo bench tiny_keccak/v1\r\n```\r\nGit commits used for my benchmarks:\r\n- `805ff4ef4a7db59d6aa117218a5ca79f672db2c1` (2022-03-28)\r\n- `29110ed2469702b23ea6263e1a936eb2af6701c6` (2022-02-20)\r\n\r\nIn [a previous issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/93321) I already highlighted that the same project has a fragile performance nature (heavily reacts to slight changes/optimizations/regressions) and was especially fine tuned using the following profile:\r\n```toml\r\n[profile.bench]\r\nlto = \"fat\"\r\ncodegen-units = 1\r\n```\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/95409/reactions",
