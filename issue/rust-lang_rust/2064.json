The data passed, by-val, from rust->C comes out as garbage in C. C->Rust via return and C->Rust via crust don't appear to be affected (this is in the context of my uv_tcp branch work on http://github.com/olsonjeffery/rust)\n2. when a by-val struct is including in a function signature in C, it seems that all of the parameters that come _after_ become null/garbage, as well (I encountered with a callback fn ptr that was null when it was passed into C. But moving the ptr to be _before_ the by-val struct in question caused it to be unbroken)\n\nThis is happening after #1402 was closed, and I know it was expected that there's be some bogeymen hiding out in 32bit edge cases, so hopefully this helps.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2064/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2064/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
