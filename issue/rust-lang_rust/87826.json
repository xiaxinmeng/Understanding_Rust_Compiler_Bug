Only after [looking at the source code](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.54.0/src/core/convert/mod.rs.html#559-563) I could find out that this _isn\u2019t even an implementation at all_. Searching for existing issues, the original issue on this topic is closed and concluded\r\n\r\n> This is how it currently looks, and I think it's \"good enough\". Going to close the issue.\r\n> \r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/155238/66155518-ccf30800-e5ed-11e9-8112-c9780ec32dd9.png)\r\n> <hr>\r\n>\r\n> * _source: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/64633#issuecomment-538078589_\r\n\r\nThis comment however is only visible [on the page of the `From` trait itself](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.54.0/std/convert/trait.From.html#impl-From%3C!%3E-2).\r\n\r\nAnother example of this problem, [the same `impl` on the `Option<T>` type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.54.0/std/option/enum.Option.html#impl-From%3C!%3E).\r\n\r\nI\u2019m also confused by the fact that the `impl` is only shown on _some_ types in `std` but not all. E.g. [on the `cmp::Ordering` type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.54.0/std/cmp/enum.Ordering.html#blanket-implementations) you can\u2019t see it at all.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t feel like it would be a difficult change to just make this `From` impl entirely invisible in rustdoc. I don\u2019t see any value in displaying it, and it can be very confusing, especially when displayed without the accompanying comment. \r\n\r\n@rustbot label T-rustdoc, F-rustc_attrs, T-libs-api, A-docs, C-bug\r\n\r\nTagging `T-libs-api, A-docs` as well because the situation could immediately and easily be somewhat improved by adding the \u201cthis impl does not yet exist\u201d explanation docs to the `from` method, as that one\u2019s at least being displayed everywhere (if you click the `[+]` button sufficiently often).", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87826/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87826/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
