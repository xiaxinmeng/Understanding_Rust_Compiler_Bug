Normally changing the length of a vector is done using one of the safe operations instead, such as `truncate`, `resize`, [`extend`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.extend-1), or `clear`.\r\n\r\nWhere `extend` is a link to: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.extend-1\r\n\r\nClicking that link does nothing, aside from setting the target in the URL bar. The target _does_ exist, it's just hidden/not expanded when you land on the page. (If you search for \"Extend implementation that copies elements out of references before pushing them onto the Vec.\" it's right under there.) Once you expand that, clicking the link works, but I don't think one is going to really think to do that beforehand.\r\n\r\nThis seems like exactly [#52774 docs: dead link to std::vec::Vec::extend()](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/52774), which was closed over a year ago.
