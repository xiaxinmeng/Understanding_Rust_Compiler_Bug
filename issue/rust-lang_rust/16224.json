When I run `make install`, it installs the Rust libraries to `$PREFIX/lib/rustlib/x86_64-apple-darwin/`. However, it also installs a set of native libraries to `$PREFIX/lib/`, two binaries rustc and rustdoc to `$PREFIX/bin/`, and two man pages to `$PREFIX/share/man/man1`.\n\nI want to crosscompile for several targets including `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi` and `i686-unknown-linux-gnu`. The easiest way is to install the Rust libraries for those targets into `$PREFIX/lib/rustlib/$TARGET/`. However, this isn't possible because Rust's `make install` (for a different target) would clobber the existing rustc and install many unnecessary shared libraries into `$PREFIX/lib/`.\n\nHow about a `make install-rustlib` target or something?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16224/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16224/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
