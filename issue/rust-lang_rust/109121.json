That's why many developers choose to hide them from the generated output. This leads to the problem that when copying code examples users have to manually choose the correct imports which can be error-prone.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nAdd an UI option to each Rust code block that allows to dynamically hide and show the imports.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThis may raise the question if we also want an option to show/hide all hidden code fragments.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/109121/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/109121/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
