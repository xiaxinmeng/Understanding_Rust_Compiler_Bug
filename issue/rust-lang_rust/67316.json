Generally I propose that `interp` should not contain code that is *only* needed by CTFE. We have `intern.rs` and `snapshot.rs` in there are they need some very deep access to Miri engine internals, but at least those are separate modules.\r\n\r\nAlso, `const_eval.rs` has grown pretty messy, and it does not seem like the order of definitions in that file follows any principle. We could split the file into two similar to what I did with Miri: `const_eval/engine.rs` for implementing the machine trait and defining everything that is needed during CTFE execution, and `const_eval/eval.rs` for defining the setup functions and all the glue that connects CTFE with the rest of the compiler.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/67316/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/67316/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
