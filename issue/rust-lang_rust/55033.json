However, at least to me such an `#[ignore]` attribute (or come up with a better name for it) would be much more explicit which sticks better to the explicit nature of the language itself.\r\n\r\n### Other Sources\r\n\r\nOn march this year (2018) @petrochenkov was already talking about the usefulness of attributes for formal function parameters in [this](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48848#issuecomment-371630670) thread.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIf there is anybody who is free of time and wants to give it a try I would be very grateful.
