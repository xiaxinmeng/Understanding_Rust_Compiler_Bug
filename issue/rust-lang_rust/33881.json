Doing so will not only improve the ergonomics for the library user but also help in providing a less roundabout implementation for the peek() method. Iterators which cannot implement Peekable directly should continue to use the Peekable adapter.\n\nThis will change the first snippet as follows...\n\n```\nlet chars = \"abc\".chars();\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", chars.peek());\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "dtolnay", "id": 1940490, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDA0OTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1940490?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay", "html_url": "https://github.com/dtolnay", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33881/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33881/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
