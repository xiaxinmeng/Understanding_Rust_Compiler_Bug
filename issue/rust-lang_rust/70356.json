It is not clear why that happens.\r\n\r\n~~As discussed in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70241#discussion_r396066858, it turns out that const-prop will sometimes permit reading from mutable global allocations. That could be a soundness issue in case those allocations are actually mutated at run-time; const-prop would then be propagating non-constant data.~~\r\n\r\n~~Currently it is not entirely clear what those mutable allocations are that const-prop is reading from, all we have is an ICE because an unexpected error (\"const-prop does not support reading from mutable global allocation\") arose during validation. It is also unclear (to me, at least) why const-prop is doing validation at all.~~\r\n\r\nCc @oli-obk @wesleywiser ", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/70356/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/70356/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
