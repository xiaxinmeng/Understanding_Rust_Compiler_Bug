@arielb1 has largely been resolved. However, there remain some traits that were added before the new rules were completed, and which do not conform. Those traits are currently distinguished with `old_orphan_check` markers. The remaining work is to fix these traits:\n- [x] `BorrowFrom`\n- [x] `BorrowFromMut`\n- [x] `IntoCow`\n- [x] `ToOwned`\n- [ ] `PartialEq`\n\n\\- @nikomatsakis\n\n**ORIGINAL ISSUE:**\n\nThe current version of orphan checking does not prevent me from break coherence if impls from different crates are non-orphan because of different type parameters of the same type, for example:\n\nbase.rs:\n\n```\npub trait Base { fn work(&self); }\n```\n\nfoo.rs:\n\n```\nextern crate base;\npub struct Foo;\n\nimpl<T> base::Base for (Foo, T) {\n  fn work(&self) { println!(\"foo!\"); }\n}\n```\n\nbar.rs:\n\n```\nextern crate base;\npub struct Bar;\n\nimpl<T> base::Base for (T, Bar) {\n  fn work(&self) { println!(\"bar!\"); }\n}\n```\n\nfoobar.rs:\n\n```\nextern crate foo;\nextern crate bar;\nextern crate base;\nuse base::Base;\n\nfn main() { (foo::Foo, bar::Bar).work(); }\n```\n\nWhich of course ICE-s with a trans ambiguity.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19470/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19470/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
