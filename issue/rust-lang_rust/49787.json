Which seems to imply that some kind of error will be generated if `#[derive(Clone)]` is used in that case.\r\n\r\nIn other words, someone who read the documentation would expect\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Clone)]\r\nstruct SomeStruct<T> {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nto fail, Because T is not Clone.\r\n\r\nWhile in reality, a `impl<T: Clone> Clone for SomeStruct<T>` is generated, so it compiles. This can sometimes be frustrating because I sometimes forget to write `T: Clone`, only to find out much later when I actually need `.clone()`.\r\n\r\nApparently it is impractical to change the behaviour of `#[derive]` now. But I think the document can be worded better. And perhaps an alternate version of `#[derive]` that fails early can be added.", "closed_by": {"login": "sfackler", "id": 1455697, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTU2OTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1455697?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler", "html_url": "https://github.com/sfackler", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/49787/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/49787/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
