Interestingly, there is no obvious/prominent link to Crates.io or top-level or near top-level discussion of how Rust handles libraries/crates etc.\r\n\r\nToday, the main site has the following at the top:\r\n\r\n   Documentation - Install - Community - Contribute\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if that was change to:\r\n\r\n   Documentation - Install - Crates - Community - Contribute\r\n\r\nIt would be beneficial if each of these had a hover/pop-up/tootip for mouse-over that gave a a brief overview as follows:\r\n\r\n   * Documentation - Documentation Resources about Rust and the Rust ecosystem\r\n   * Install - Information about installing the Rust compiler tool-chain and Crates management tool-chain\r\n   * Crates - Information about Crates (Libraries and Software) written and available in Rust on Crates.io\r\n   * Community - ...\r\n   * Contribute - ...\r\n\r\nThen, when the Crates header is clicked it would have a page dedicated to a brief overview of Cargo and Crates.io with a Prominent and obvious link to Crates.io as well as links to other Cargo and Crates.io related resources.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the information about Crates.io and Cargo could be put on the Documentation page in a prominent position.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only  link I can find on the main Rust site pages to Crates.io is here:\r\n\r\n    References\r\n\r\n    Standard Library API Reference. Documentation for the standard library.\r\n    docs.rs. Documentation for all crates published to crates.io.\r\n    The Rust Reference. While Rust does not have a specification, the reference tries to describe its working in detail. It tends to be out of date.\r\n\r\nThat seems rather well-hidden and doesn't really even mention what crates.io is or how important it is to the ecosystem. This seems like something that should be more prominent and something those new/interested in Rust should not have to go digging for (or asking questions about on r/rust: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/8t2vzc/is_there_a_website_with_a_listing_of_all/)", "closed_by": {"login": "gbutler69", "id": 1789892, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk4OTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1789892?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbutler69", "html_url": "https://github.com/gbutler69", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbutler69/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbutler69/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbutler69/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbutler69/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbutler69/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbutler69/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbutler69/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbutler69/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbutler69/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51720/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51720/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
