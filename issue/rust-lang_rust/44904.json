This is basically the code embodied by [`infer.rs` in the prototype](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/nll/blob/master/nll/src/infer.rs). In particular, this inference context ought to take ownership of the region values that were added in #44878. It would then also collect a series of **constraints**. In the prototype, those constraints take two forms:\r\n\r\n- **Liveness** constraints, which basically just insert a single point into a region. [In the prototype](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/nll/blob/master/nll/src/infer.rs#L82-L90), these are inserted directly into the value for the region as soon as the constraint is added. In the RFC, these are expressed in terms of outlives constraints that relate a region variable R to a singleton region (e.g., `R: {P} @ P`).\r\n- **Outlives** constraints, which relate two region variables at a particular point. [In the prototype](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/nll/blob/master/nll/src/infer.rs#L95), these are accumulated into a vector. The [solve routine](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/nll/blob/master/nll/src/infer.rs#L102-L141) then propagates values between variables according to these constraints.\r\n\r\nIn the **prototype**, everything is a region variable, but some variables can [**capped**](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/nll/blob/master/nll/src/infer.rs#L77), which means that it is an error if they grow. Effectively those variables then become constants. We might want to code things up a bit differently, so that outlives constraints can encode constants as well. In particular, this is needed to report hard errors relating to free regions.", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44904/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44904/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
