For instance, you need to call `libc::unlink` on the path you are about to bind just in case it was previously leaked. Moreover, from what I understand, since `AF_UNIX` sockets don't implement `SO_REUSEADDR`, there not viable use for this leaked file.\r\n\r\nI suggest that `libc::unlink` is called when one of these sockets are dropped (if the socket was bound to a path) just after `libc::close` so that the socket file is removed when there are no open sockets referencing it left.\r\n\r\nFor reference: https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/pull/1111\r\n\r\n## Meta\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.38.0 (625451e37 2019-09-23)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 625451e376bb2e5283fc4741caa0a3e8a2ca4d54\r\ncommit-date: 2019-09-23\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.38.0\r\nLLVM version: 9.0\r\n```", "closed_by": {"login": "sfackler", "id": 1455697, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTU2OTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1455697?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler", "html_url": "https://github.com/sfackler", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/65895/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/65895/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
