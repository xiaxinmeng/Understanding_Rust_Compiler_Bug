The goal is for everyone to get familiar with the overall \"chalk\" setup.\r\n\r\n[basic framework for lowering]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/48985\r\n\r\n### The tasks\r\n\r\nEach task corresponds to one of the rules [documented in the rustc-guide][rg]. You can search the guide for the rule name in order to find some text explaining the rule. **If you want to do a rule, just check the box and edit this post to add your name** (if you are a member of the [GitHub team], you should have privileges for that).  If you are not yet a member of the WG-traits group, leave a comment below or [ping me on gitter][gitter] and I will add you.\r\n\r\n[rg]: https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-guide/traits/lowering-rules.html\r\n[GitHub team]: https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/teams/wg-traits/\r\n[gitter]: https://gitter.im/rust-lang/WG-traits\r\n\r\n- [x] Rule Implemented-From-Impl: this is the template rule that [@scalexm started with][ife].\r\n- [x] Rule Implemented-From-Env -- @varkor (PR #49211)\r\n- [x] Rule Implied-Bound-From-Trait -- @tmandry (PR #49435)\r\n- [x] Rule WellFormed-TraitRef -- @csmoe (PR #50250)\r\n- [x] Rule ProjectionEq-Normalize  -- @csmoe (PR #52153)\r\n- [x] Rule ProjectionEq-Skolemize -- @scalexm (PR #54909)\r\n- [x] Rule Normalize-From-Impl -- @fanzier (PR #49626)\r\n- [ ] Rule Implied-Bound-From-AssocTy -- not needed until GATs\r\n- [x] Rule WellFormed-AssocTy -- @scalexm (PR #54909)\r\n- [ ] Rule Implied-WC-From-AssocTy -- not needed until GATs / where clauses on assoc types\r\n- [x] Rule Implied-Trait-From-AssocTy -- @scalexm (PR ##54909)\r\n\r\n[ife]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/a04b88d1941644df01fa5e31dd43e0f57c13d938/src/librustc_traits/lowering.rs#L121-L130\r\n\r\n### Mentoring instructions\r\n\r\nAs described above, the goal is to add the code to generate appropriate program clauses from various Rust constructs. You should use the `Implemented-From-Impl` rule as a kind of template:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/a04b88d1941644df01fa5e31dd43e0f57c13d938/src/librustc_traits/lowering.rs#L121-L130\r\n\r\nEach rule should also have a unit-test. This [rustc-guide chapter](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-guide/blob/master/src/traits-lowering-module.md) describes how to create such unit tests.\r\n\r\ncc @rust-lang/wg-traits ", "closed_by": {"login": "camelid", "id": 37223377, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjIzMzc3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37223377?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid", "html_url": "https://github.com/camelid", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/49177/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/49177/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
