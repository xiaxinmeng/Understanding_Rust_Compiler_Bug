I understand that all functions are associated items, but for newcomers this error message isn't really helpful because associated items are an intermediate concept. Error messages shouldn't hit intermediate concepts for beginner code.\r\n\r\n*ideally* we would notice the difference between something being used within a call expression and something not being used that way, however that's a bit tricky since in the typechecking code by the time we reach this we only know that it's a path. The \"are we checking the callee\" info could be propagated, but I'm not sure if it's worth it.\r\n\r\nA more straightforward bandaid fix would be to say \"function or associated item\" if the first character is lowercase, and \"associated item\" if the first character is uppercase.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42386/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42386/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
