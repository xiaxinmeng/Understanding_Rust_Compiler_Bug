This change makes a lot of sense, and it's not difficult to update, but there is now a situation where code using the old path roots won't compile on new nightlies and vice versa.\r\n\r\nBecause the error message is just that the file is missing, there's a lot of confusion (e.g., https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/bulletproofs/pull/290,  https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/bulletproofs/pull/282, https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/bulletproofs/issues/292, https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek/pull/269, https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek/pull/275) about build failures.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add a warning to the \"file missing\" error for `#[doc(include)]` noting that the path changed recently?  This won't help the case of compiling new-doc-paths-on-old-nightlies but might give a hint about what's going on when there's a build failure with old-doc-paths-on-new-nightlies.", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63335/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63335/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
