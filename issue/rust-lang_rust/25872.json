In #25784 I refactored the bindings and verified them for all current ports, I think we can turn this on on all current ports. This would enable handlers on Android, iOS, FreeBSD, and Dragonfly.\n\nI don't have easy build infras for these myself, so I'm probably not going to do this immediately. But if someone wants to test one out and make sure that it works, I think it's just a matter of adding an OS to the `#[cfg]` and writing a program that segfaults.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25872/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25872/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
