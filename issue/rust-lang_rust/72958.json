For example, the HTTP status codes on this[ doc page](https://docs.rs/http/0.2.1/http/status/struct.StatusCode.html). As an honest comparison, here is the similar doc on [Python page](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.html#http-status-codes).  Note that Rust's page has the same info, but with a different layout. The problem is the layout.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\n\r\nMy request is: change the default layout of `cargo doc` to :\r\n- A clear section for struct's `Consts`, separate from `Methods`.\r\n- Remove duplicated info, for example:  all `pub const` can be in one sub-section titled `pub const` and no need to repeat `pub const` for each value. Also, no need to repeat the struct name for each const value.\r\n- Consider using a table format for `Consts`.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n<!-- Any additional context or information you feel may be relevant to the issue. -->\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/72958/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/72958/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
