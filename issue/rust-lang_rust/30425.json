Serializing doesn't have the same issue. There seem to be two solutions to this, either provide an explicit constructor that returns a Weak without using a strong reference to create it, or implementing Default for it that does the same. I prefer the former, as Default might be a bit surprising.\n\nThis would be a simple, non-backwards-incompatible change.
