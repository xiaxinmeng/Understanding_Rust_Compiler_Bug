I don't really get what the USER != SUDO_USER heuristic is intended to protect against, but it looks a bit fishy to me. For one thing, from this failure it would seem that it has not seen testing in very diverse environments, so using `.get('USER')` and `.get('SUDO_USER')` would probably make a lot more sense here. Second, while the goal appears to be to set `enable_vendored_sources` in some situations, this code is still executed when `enable_vendored_sources` is already set.
