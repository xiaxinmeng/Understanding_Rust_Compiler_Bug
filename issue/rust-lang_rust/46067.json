This means that for \"medium-sized\" structs (by this I mean: large enough that copies are expensive, but not so large that they should be boxed, such as finite field elements, group elements, etc.), naively implementing the `ops` traits for `T` rather than for `&T` can cause excessive copies and hurt performance.\r\n\r\nThe docs mention that\r\n\r\n> For example, for a user-defined type T which is supposed to support addition, it is probably a good idea to have both T and &T implement the traits Add<T> and Add<&T> so that generic code can be written without unnecessary cloning.\r\n\r\nbut don't describe how to actually do this, which requires using HRTBs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimpl<'a, 'b> Add<&'b ExtendedPoint> for &'a ExtendedPoint {\r\n    /* ... */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis syntax isn't intuitive, and there's no mention that \"HRTBs\" are required to actually implement the `std::ops` traits for `&T`.\r\n\r\nI think it would be good to mention \"higher ranked trait bounds\" in the `std::ops` documentation, since, for better or for worse, they're apparently required to implement the traits properly.", "closed_by": {"login": "hdevalence", "id": 44879, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODc5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44879?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/hdevalence", "html_url": "https://github.com/hdevalence", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hdevalence/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hdevalence/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hdevalence/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hdevalence/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hdevalence/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hdevalence/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hdevalence/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hdevalence/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hdevalence/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46067/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 1, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46067/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
