Investigating it looks like a MIR bootstrap (`--enable-orbit`) is taking about a half hour longer than a normal bootstrap. For example compare:\n- [Normal bootstrap](http://buildbot.rust-lang.org/builders/auto-win-msvc-64-opt/builds/3868)\n- [MIR bootstrap](http://buildbot.rust-lang.org/builders/auto-win-msvc-64-opt-mir/builds/371)\n\nIn the normal case a bootstrap took 58m and the MIR case took 1h22m. The difference is not always quite as drastic, but historically the normal builders are consistently faster than MIR. The discrepancy also exists on the Linux MIR builders, although it's not quite as large as the Windows machines (~15m slower).\n\ncc @eddyb, @nagisa \n", "closed_by": {"login": "eddyb", "id": 77424, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDI0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77424?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb", "html_url": "https://github.com/eddyb", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33111/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33111/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
