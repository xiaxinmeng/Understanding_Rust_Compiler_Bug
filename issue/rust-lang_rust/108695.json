with how the warning works when it comes to modules, During some coding I had to divide into modules, some of them are located in `/src/utils/`, While some of the utils located there beside `main.rs` requires other utils to be able to work the only solution for me was to use the path expression `#[path = './module.rs']` then `mod module` to use it in my code\r\n\r\nUsing the module doesn't get read by the compiler, So I may be using `module::function` in my code and the compiler would still show me warning that I didn't use `function` in the module and it's an unused function that should be either removed or used \r\n\r\nHere's my directory structure \r\n\r\n```\r\n./\r\n./src/\r\n./target/\r\n.gitignore\r\nCargo.lock\r\nCargo.toml\r\n\r\n./src/main.rs\r\n./src/utils/\r\n\r\n./src/utils/mod.rs\r\n[more rs modules here]\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code works fine though, The function i'm using gets executed, it's just about the errors and how it's not supposed to be there since everything is working fine ig?", "closed_by": null, "reactions":
