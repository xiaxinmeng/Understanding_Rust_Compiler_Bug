However, I get a warning instead:\r\n```\r\nwarning: `macro` is experimental\r\n --> src/lib.rs:4:1\r\n  |\r\n4 | pub macro mymacro() {}\r\n  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  |\r\n  = note: [see issue #39412 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/39412>](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/39412) for more information\r\n  = help: [add `#![feature(decl_macro)]`](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2021#) to the crate attributes to enable\r\n  = warning: unstable syntax can change at any point in the future, causing a hard error!\r\n  = note: for more information, [see issue #65860 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65860>](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65860)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like the `cfg` *does* disable the feature flag, but does *not* disable parsing of the rest of the file. That is a problem, since it means it is impossible to `cfg`-out an entire file that contains experimental syntax. I thought I could fix this by ordering the `cfg` after the `feature`, but as the example shows that does not help.\r\n\r\nThis probably started happening with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/99935.\r\nCc @CAD97 @petrochenkov ", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/104633/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/104633/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
