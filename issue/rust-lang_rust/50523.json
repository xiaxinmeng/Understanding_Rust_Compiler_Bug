For cases like these, it'd be very handy to have a concise way of turning booleans into `Option`s. For example:\r\n```rust\r\nimpl bool {\r\n    fn map_true<T>(&self, on_true: T) -> Option<T> { if *self { Some(on_true) } else { None }}\r\n    fn map_false<T>(&self, on_true: T) -> Option<T> { if *self { None } else { Some(on_true) }}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThere could also be closure variants of this for cases where the `T` is expensive to construct, but in my experience those cases are rarer. That would let the code above become:\r\n```rust\r\nfoo.map_true(bar)\r\n```\r\nThe name could of course be bikeshed (`if_true`?), but I think this is a pretty versatile and useful shorthand!", "closed_by": {"login": "jonhoo", "id": 176295, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjI5NQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/176295?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonhoo", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonhoo", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonhoo/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonhoo/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonhoo/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonhoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonhoo/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonhoo/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonhoo/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonhoo/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonhoo/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/50523/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/50523/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
