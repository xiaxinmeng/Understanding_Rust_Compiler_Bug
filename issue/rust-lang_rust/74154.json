It seems that, when passing in unique references to temporary empty slices, the underlying pointers nonetheless alias.\r\n\r\nI expected all such pointers to never alias; this even holds when replacing `[T]` above with the ZST `[T; 0]`, which makes it significantly more worrying, since it does *not* hold for the same code using `()`.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this behavior is *actually* specified, but I'd like an answer to whether this is a miscompilation or (un)documented implementation-defined behavior. At any rate, I wonder if it would be a good idea to make this behavior consistent for all ZST temporaries...\r\n\r\nAlso, I aught to mention that this is about ZSTs lying in *distinct allocations*. For a type such as `((), ())`, we expect the two unit values to have the same addresses. The closest mention of this I could find in the nomicon to this was the implementation of `Vec<()>`, but that's still regarding same-allocation references, so that didn't give me a particularly satisfying answer.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\nThis issue is reproducible on latest beta and nightly.\r\n\r\nI could not find an issue corresponding to this bug; feel free to close as duplicate.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74154/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74154/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
