Typically this is a PR\r\nimplementing a feature, followed by a PR that stabilises the feature. However\r\nfor larger features an implementation could be broken up into multiple PRs.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77119)\r\n- [x] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][stabilization-guide])\r\n\r\n[stabilization-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr\r\n\r\n### Implementation history\r\n\r\n- [x] Initial implementation (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77119)\r\n- [x] Expanded to HTML comments (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77753)\r\n- [x] Stabilization PR (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/101720)\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Original issue</summary>\r\n\r\nRustdoc currently allows HTML in markdown, which is fine. The problem is that it doesn't sanitize the HTML at all, which means you can do wacky stuff like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n/// This is basically a Vec<Script>\r\npub enum ScriptExtension { /* ... */ }\r\n\r\n\r\nimpl ScriptExtension {\r\n   /// docs\r\n   pub fn some_func() {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nin which the `Vec<Script>` parses as an opening script tag, and the rest of the docs just ... disappear\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1617736/71652986-f12ac600-2d4f-11ea-9811-cc6e563b2d3d.png)\r\n\r\nThis isn't great, and it's kind of surprising. Perhaps we should sanitize these, or at least warn when it happens? This may not be easy or cheap, though.\r\n\r\ncc @GuillaumeGomez @kinnison \r\n\r\n</details>", "closed_by": {"login": "GuillaumeGomez", "id": 3050060, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTAwNjA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3050060?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez", "html_url": "https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/67799/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/67799/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
