This allows us to take advantage of macro expansion and a proper parsing step to find multi-line attributes or `extern crate` statements with the `#[macro_use]` on a separate line.\r\n\r\nI believe it's possible to break up the compilation steps in `test::run_test` like in `core::run_core`, except this time we'd stop after `phase_2` and inspect the crate for our desired items. If the test doesn't have a `fn main` or the right `extern crate` statement, then we can modify the crate in-place (or attempt to splice in the right text in the original text and run compilation again) before continuing. I haven't tried it, but i'd like to sketch it out soon.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57415/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57415/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
