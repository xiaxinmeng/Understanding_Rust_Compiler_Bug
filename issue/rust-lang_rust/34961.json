The two enums below, `Foo` and `Bar`, consist of two variants each. Each variant is <= 8 bytes, so the total size should fit within (8+tag) bytes, and they should take up the same space as each other. It seems however that the data is being stored adjacently rather than overlapping, as `Foo` takes up 16 bytes and `Bar` takes up 12 bytes. Is this a bug or is there an alternative way to obtain more compact data structures? (I suppose I could manually tag a struct and use `transmute` if necessary.)\n\n``` rust\nenum Foo {\n    Integer(i64),\n    Rational(i32, u32)\n}\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", std::mem::size_of::<Foo>());\n// => 16\n\nenum Bar {\n    Integer(i32),\n    Rational(i32, u32)\n}\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", std::mem::size_of::<Bar>());\n// => 12\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "sourtin", "id": 3945901, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDU5MDE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3945901?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sourtin", "html_url": "https://github.com/sourtin", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sourtin/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sourtin/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sourtin/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sourtin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sourtin/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sourtin/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sourtin/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sourtin/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sourtin/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34961/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34961/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
