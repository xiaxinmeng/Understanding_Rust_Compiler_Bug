I knew I had to add `macro_use`, `macro_export` somehow, but couldn't remember details.\r\n\r\nWhile `rustc` was somewhat helpful in warning me on my first attempt:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: cannot find macro `test!` in this scope\r\n --> src/x/u/u.rs:5:1\r\n  |\r\n5 | test! {\r\n  | ^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  |\r\n  = help: have you added the `#[macro_use]` on the module/import?\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt did not warn me about doing this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#[macro_export] \r\nmod m;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere in reality I should have done that:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#[macro_use] \r\nmod m;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was particularly confusing since the used macro was a few modules down in the hierarchy, and I should have done `#[macro_use]` on each level. Since I wasn't warned, I assumed `#[macro_export] mod m;` was correct. Instead, I tried a few permutations adding `#[macro_use]` to other places,  which all didn't work out. \r\n\r\nTwo things that would have worked for me:\r\n\r\n- Warn about `#[macro_export] mod m;`\r\n- Make the help text above more explicit, e.g., by suggesting that `macro_use` needs to be added to all parent modules (maybe with a link to the [error index](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html))\r\n\r\nUpdate: using `rustc 1.29.0-nightly (9fd3d7899 2018-07-07)`\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52371/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52371/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
