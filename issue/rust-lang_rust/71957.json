compile:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#![deny(rust_2018_idioms)]\r\n\r\nmod blah {\r\n    #![allow(rust_2018_idioms)]\r\n\r\n    struct Thing<'a>(&'a i32);\r\n\r\n    struct Bar<T>(T);\r\n\r\n    fn foo(b: Bar<Thing>) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith the error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: hidden lifetime parameters in types are deprecated\r\n  --> src/lib.rs:10:19\r\n   |\r\n10 |     fn foo(b: Bar<Thing>) {}\r\n   |                   ^^^^^- help: indicate the anonymous lifetime: `<'_>`\r\n   |\r\nnote: the lint level is defined here\r\n  --> src/lib.rs:1:9\r\n   |\r\n1  | #![deny(rust_2018_idioms)]\r\n   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n   = note: `#[deny(elided_lifetimes_in_paths)]` implied by `#[deny(rust_2018_idioms)]`\r\n```\r\n\r\nand I expected the inner `allow` to override the outer `deny`.\r\n\r\n## Variations\r\n\r\nWhat's weird is that this code, with `unused_variables` instead of `rust_2018_idioms`, compiles (with other warnings) as I expect:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#![deny(unused_variables)]\r\n\r\nmod blah {\r\n    #![allow(unused_variables)]\r\n\r\n    struct Thing<'a>(&'a i32);\r\n\r\n    struct Bar<T>(T);\r\n\r\n    fn foo(b: Bar<Thing>) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(and removing the `allow` causes it to not compile as I would expect)\r\n\r\nAND this code compiles (with other warnings) as I expect:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#![deny(rust_2018_idioms)]\r\n\r\nmod blah {\r\n    #![allow(rust_2018_idioms)]\r\n    extern crate rand;\r\n    use rand::Rng;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nso it seems to be something to do with `elided_lifetimes_in_paths` in particular...?\r\n\r\nI also tried this, which I would expect to compile but does not:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#![deny(rust_2018_idioms)]\r\n\r\nmod blah {\r\n    #![allow(elided_lifetimes_in_paths)]\r\n\r\n    struct Thing<'a>(&'a i32);\r\n\r\n    struct Bar<T>(T);\r\n\r\n    fn foo(b: Bar<Thing>) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis I would also expect to compile but does not:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#![deny(elided_lifetimes_in_paths)]\r\n\r\nmod blah {\r\n    #![allow(elided_lifetimes_in_paths)]\r\n\r\n    struct Thing<'a>(&'a i32);\r\n\r\n    struct Bar<T>(T);\r\n\r\n    fn foo(b: Bar<Thing>) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI started thinking maybe it had something to do with allow-by-default lints, but this compiles as I would expect:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#![deny(missing_docs)]\r\n//! hi\r\n\r\n/// Hi\r\npub mod blah {\r\n    #![allow(missing_docs)]\r\n\r\n    pub struct Foo {\r\n        pub field: i32,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSooo I don't have any real guesses without compiler internals knowledge \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \r\n\r\n## Related\r\n\r\nIt sounds related to this issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70819\r\nbut I decided to file a new issue because that one appears to be about the *same* \"scope level\" and I think I'm doing *different* scope levels? Please close if this is a dupe!\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\nI'm using stable 1.43; I also confirmed that 1.42 and 1.41 have the same behavior so this is not a recent regression. \r\n\r\nI also confirmed that beta 1.44.0-beta.2 and nightly 2020-05-05 f8d394e5184fe3af761e have the same behavior.\r\n\r\n## Why this matters\r\n\r\nI'm trying to `include!` code generated by a build script from another crate that generates 2015 edition Rust, from within a crate where I'd like to enforce 2018 idioms.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/71957/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/71957/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
