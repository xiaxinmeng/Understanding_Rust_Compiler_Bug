Unfortunately after looking at the parser a bit it's not obvious what to do to make this situation clearer. Possibly `parse_outer_attributes` should emit a new error if its call to to `parse_attribute` fails. It can look at whether it has a previously-parsed attribute, and whether it was a doc comment, and emit better errors, e.g.\n\nFor non-doc comments: \"inner attributes may not follow outer attributes\"; for doc comments: \"inner attributes may not follow outer doc-comments\". A good comparison to draw is with the existing error in `parser_outer_attributes` when it encounters a incorrect inner doc comment. The errors should be similar for incorrect inner attributes vs. incorrect inner doc comments.\n\n[Original issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/2789#issuecomment-44718206).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34516/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34516/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
