However, this doesn't extend to `.fixed` files, which are used inside Clippy. For this reason, we still have a bunch of `#[allow()]` attributes in Clippy's tests. It would be nice to have an option to allow lints inside `.fixed` compilation tests.\r\n\r\nIn a related discussion (See rust-lang/rust-clippy#7611), we agreed that it would also be cool, if we could be more specific than just allowing all lint's inside the `unused` group. I would suggest adding a new configuration with an enum like this:\r\n\r\n```rs\r\npub enum LintConfiguration {\r\n    /// No lints are automatically allowed\r\n    None,\r\n    /// All lints inside the `unused` lint group are allowed\r\n    UnusedLints,\r\n    /// List of lints that should be allowed. The names should be\r\n    /// provided in the console format using dashes\r\n    SpecificLints(&[&str])\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nClippy uses `compiletest-rs` which is the downstream crate currently managed by @Manishearth. It would be great if this implementation could be done here and then transferred into `compiletest-rs` to keep them kind of in sync.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm currently quite busy with RL stuff, but would be happy to work on this in about a month, if it would be accepted in rustc's compiletest version. Any feedback regarding the idea is welcome!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ncc: @rust-lang/devtools @Manishearth\r\n\r\n@rustbot label +A-testsuite +C-enhancement +T-dev-tools", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88918/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88918/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
