However, [simple target implementation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/58012) cannot be built against current rustc/8.0-2019-01-16 LLVM version. We need to get some LLVM patches for RV64 from upstream (which are already there). At the moment I have no idea how to achieve this. Hypothetical choices are:\r\n* Cherry-pick only the necessary patches into Rust LLVM tree\r\n* Determine some point in upstream LLVM which contains all needed patches and merge it into Rust LLVM tree\r\n* Rebase Rust LLVM tree to the point mentioned above\r\n\r\nI will experiment with different choices, but I need to know which approach is actually used and what should I do next.", "closed_by": {"login": "Disasm", "id": 1418749, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTg3NDk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1418749?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Disasm", "html_url": "https://github.com/Disasm", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Disasm/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Disasm/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Disasm/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Disasm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Disasm/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Disasm/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Disasm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Disasm/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Disasm/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58335/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58335/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
