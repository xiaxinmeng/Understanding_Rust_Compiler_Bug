Would it be feasible to have a link to the source code on github for the specific function/macro from its doc? \nFor example, from this doc: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.try!.html\nI wanted to know what's in-between these `{ ... }` and I imagined how great would be if there were a nearby link pointing to the source code for this `try!` macro. An example of such link would be: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/stable/src/libcore/macros.rs#L194\n That kind of immediate accessibility would increase everyone's knowledge, I believe, because it would be less deterring than doing something like this instead: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22macro_rules!+try%22&type=Code \n(personally I wouldn't have looked it up at all; but depends on each person's drive, I guess)\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31601/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31601/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
