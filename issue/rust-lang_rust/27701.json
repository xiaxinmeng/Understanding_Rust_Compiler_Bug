There are a number of features currently associated with libcore:\n- `core`\n- `core_char_ext`\n- `core_prelude`\n- `core_slice_ext`\n- `core_str_ext`\n\n(note that `core_float` will be handled in a separate issue)\n\nThe design of libcore largely mirrors that of the standard library (good) but there are a few deviations:\n- `core::atomic` differs from `std::sync::atomic`\n- Modules like `nonzero`, `panicking`, and `array` are public\n\nOverall there are a number of tasks that probably need to be done before stabilizing these items:\n- [x] A full audit should be done to ensure that the structure of libcore is the same as the structure of libstd\n- [x] The name `core` needs to be agreed upon as the stable name for the library\n- [x] The set of extension traits for primitives needs to be decided upon. This strategy of trait-in-core and inherent-above-core should be agreed upon as the best path forward.\n- [x] The set of items in the prelude should be audited to ensure it's a subset of the standard library's\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27701/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27701/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
