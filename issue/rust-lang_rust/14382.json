Ideally we would actually manage to properly assign `f32` to the type of `x`, since I do not see any reason for the generic float type to be constrained to `f64`.  (Note that if you add a `: f32` type annotation to the `let x` then compilation terminates successfully.)\n2. But even if we cannot accomplish that goal for some hypothetical reason, we still need to a better job with the error message here.\n\nNote also that the `impl POrd<f64> for f64 {}` is necessary to reproduce the poor-quality error message given here.  If you remove it, you get this instead: `error: failed to find an implementation of trait POrd<<generic float #0>> for <generic float #0>` (which also is not great, but at least then I have a hint that my problem originates with some use of a generic float literal somewhere in my code.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/14382/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/14382/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
