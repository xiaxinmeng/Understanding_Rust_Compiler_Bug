I love how everything you do, you release a source code, but I must admit it is a bit of a shame that you use GitHub as the main respo. What about moving the main respo to GitLab, which is open-source and it's very similar to GitHub in almost every way, if not better, and just keeping GitHub as a mirror instead.\r\n\r\nAlso, maybe you could mirror the project to SourceForge and CodePlex. SourceForge still has a pretty decent community, even after the admin disaster and CodePlex gives a portion of ad money to the projects, so as long as the ads were clicked on your project page. I know a lot of people use ad blockers these days, but you never know maybe some people would be willing to click on a few to help out.\r\n\r\nJust a suggestion which I would think would help Rust out some.", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40716/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40716/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
