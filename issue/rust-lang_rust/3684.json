He's messing around with moving a channel into a task, which is then passed to a closure. This fails with \n\n```\nfoo.rs:5:56: 5:58 error: copying a noncopyable value\nfoo.rs:5         let fail_: fn~(~str) -> ! = fn~(x: ~str) -> ! { wr.send(x); fail; };\n                                                                 ^~\nfoo.rs:5:56: 5:58 note: non-copyable value cannot be copied into a ~fn closure\nfoo.rs:5         let fail_: fn~(~str) -> ! = fn~(x: ~str) -> ! { wr.send(x); fail; };\n```\n\nHowever, if we get rid of the task, it works fine. I would have thought that moving the channel into the task would be roughly equivalent to the non-task version, but I'm probably missing some subtly in the borrower.\n\nIn the meantime, you can use `pipes::SharedChan` to write this kind of function.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3684/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3684/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
