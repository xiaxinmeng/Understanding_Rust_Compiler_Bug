Test project [here](https://github.com/irh/rust-big-sur-test/tree/5b23ad719c477c31c6121ef7d6f3e8093569b513).\r\n\r\nWhen invoking `cargo build` from an Xcode build script, `SDKROOT` is set for the platform that's being built. #64254 made it so that `SDKROOT` gets un-set if the target platform doesn't match the host platform. This seems reasonable to me, but then I don't understand why there's now a difference in behaviour between Xcode and non-Xcode builds. \r\n\r\nI logged a similiar [issue](https://github.com/TimNN/cargo-lipo/issues/41) for `cargo-lipo`, which has a different workaround of instead setting `LIBRARY_PATH`.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80817/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80817/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
