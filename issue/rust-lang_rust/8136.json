Such a tombstone is one of two closure values (where in both cases, `others` has type `Cell<Option<~fn() -> bool>>`):\n\n```\n                    || {\n                        // Prefer to check tombstones that were there first,\n                        // being \"more fair\" at the expense of tail-recursion.\n                        others.take().map_consume_default(true, |f| f()) && {\n                            let mut inner = this.take().unwrap();\n                            (!inner.any_child_failed) &&\n                                inner.child_tombstones.take_map_default(true, |f| f())\n                        }\n                    }\n```\n\n```\n                    || {\n                        // Prefer fairness to tail-recursion, as in above case.\n                        others.take().map_consume_default(true, |f| f()) &&\n                            f.take()()\n                    }\n```\n\nHowever, as noted, this can stack overflow, and since we don't guarantee tail-call optimization, even making it tail-recursive isn't reliable(?). A way to expose this is to edit `task-perf-jargon-metal-smoke.rs` to use `spawn` instead of `spawn_supervised` (which enables this exit-status-watching code).\n\nTo fix this, the tombstones should be changed to a struct. When storing them in the list, since there are two possible types of tombstones, they can either be packed as a trait or stored in an Either (probably the latter is better).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8136/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8136/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
