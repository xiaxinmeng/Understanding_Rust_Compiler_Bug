Generally, the only new language features added after this milestone must be backwards compatible, or to fix soundness holes, though we do expect to have some leeway to make small incompatible fixes that have low impact on existing code bases.\r\n\r\n* Library stability - We have a system of measuring and ensuring the stability of API's, and a significant portion of the standard library is declared stable. Stable API's will not change. Large portions of the standard library need to be stable for 1.0, including primitive types, vectors, strings, option, numerics, collections, some I/O and concurrency.\r\n\r\n* User experience - The system is polished and the presentation is complete and professional. New users have a clear path to using and learning the system. This encompasses the web site, documentation, installation, and tooling.\r\n", "creator": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 376, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2013-10-10T18:48:33Z", "updated_at": "2016-08-28T23:13:24Z", "due_on": "2015-05-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2015-05-21T20:59:13Z"}, "comments": 21, "created_at": "2013-09-05T10:41:59Z", "updated_at": "2014-04-14T20:27:58Z", "closed_at": "2014-04-11T00:18:14Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "We currently use mingw for win32 platform. However mingw does not support win64 (#1237), so we have to use mingw-w64 (or msvc: #1768).\nAlthough mingw and mingw-w64 looks similar, implementations differ: we have issues due to mingw which are already solved on mingw-w64. (#8663, #8859)\n\nInstead, we may switch to mingw-w64 for win32. (Yes, mingw-w64 supports win32 despite its name.) then we can reduce platform/runtime differences between win32/win64.\n\nPreviously @thadguidry [posted](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-July/004962.html) about Qt's discussion on mingw/mingw-w64.
