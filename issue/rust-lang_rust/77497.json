I looked a little bit to see if this was documented somewhere and I didn't see anything super obvious.\r\n\r\nIs this something that is defined behavior, and if it is, could we clarify it in the primitive `pointer` type documentation? This can be relevant especially in many kernel designs when there are \"negative\" addresses in the kernel and \"positive\" in user-space.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-B", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77497/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77497/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
