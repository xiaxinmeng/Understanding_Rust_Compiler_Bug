The docs point to the RFC, which does a better job, but I still do not feel like I fully understood what \"panic safety\" is, what does `UnwindSafe` convey, and when is it ok to use `AssertUnwindSafe` or not. \r\n\r\nI feel like the docs could do a much better job at explaining all of this, and that some examples in the RFC would help, but I don't think that any documentation we currently have about this is enough.\r\n\r\nThis is a complex topic and I have no experience teaching it to others, but if somebody has done that, their feedback should probably be taken into account. \r\n\r\nI think the API docs are very important to get right because they are currently the only teaching materials that we have about this aspect of the language. The Rust book does not cover this either, and the nomicon [Exception safety](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/exception-safety.html?highlight=panic,safety#exception-safety) has very few words to say about this.\r\n\r\ncc @steveklabnik @rust-lang/docs", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/65717/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 6, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/65717/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
