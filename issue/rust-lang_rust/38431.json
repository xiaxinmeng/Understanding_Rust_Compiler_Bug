Use --prefix to set it accordingly.`\r\n\r\nThe problem here is, I think, twofold:\r\n* Issuing `./configure --help` we get `--prefix=[/usr/local]` and `--libdir=[/lib]` which is, as far as I understand, incorrect, because with the default values Rust's libs are installed into `/usr/local/lib`, and not `/lib`\r\n* In the output of `./configure --help` it is not mentioned that libdir must begin with the prefix\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the second point could be omitted if there are a lot of caveats when setting various `configure` flags, but the first one should explicitly say something along the lines of: `--libdir=[$(CFG_PREFIX)/lib]` or `--libdir=$(prefix)/lib`.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether my reasoning isn't flawed, as this: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b1363a73ede57ae595f3a1be2bb75d308ba4f7f6/mk/install.mk#L14 seems to contradict it. But on the other hand, when installing Rust from source with default values, I see Rust's-related libs only in `/usr/local/lib` and not `/lib`.", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38431/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38431/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
