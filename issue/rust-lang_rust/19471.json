Instead, `five_back_failure()` succeeds, presumably because the panic causes the second assert to not happen.\n\nIt is convenient to have a single pass and a single pass-by-fail test. This behavior forces separate functions for each contraindicated condition, which is verbose.\n\nWorse, this expectation is silently violated: the programmer will not know that the later asserts are succeeding, since they don't happen at all. As they're intended to fail, this is a missed test.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mnemnion", "id": 231785, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTc4NQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/231785?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mnemnion", "html_url": "https://github.com/mnemnion", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mnemnion/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mnemnion/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mnemnion/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mnemnion/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mnemnion/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mnemnion/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mnemnion/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mnemnion/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mnemnion/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19471/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19471/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
