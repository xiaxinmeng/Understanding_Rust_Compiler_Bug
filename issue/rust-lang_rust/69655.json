Also, OSS-Fuzz supports fuzzing Rust libraries, so IMO that signals the project views Rust as important enough. [List of projects that are currently in OSS-Fuzz.](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects) Note that LLVM and Go are on the list, so compilers have been accepted before.\r\n\r\nCan't hurt to file a form and ask.\r\n\r\nOSS-Fuzz offers [monetary rewards for integration](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/05/oss-fuzz-five-months-later-and.html), up to $20k. It can be donated to a charity and Google will double the reward. (Has the much-talked-about Rust Foundation been created? If so, it would be a great fit.)\r\n\r\n$40k to a charity for a few days of work doesn't sound like a bad deal...\r\n\r\n(Disclaimer: I work for Google, but not on anything fuzzing or security-related. I do not speak for my employer. This suggestion comes from \"personal Val\", not \"business Val\". :smiley:)\r\n\r\ncc @Shnatsel @rust-fuzz", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69655/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69655/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
