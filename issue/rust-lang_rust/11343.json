However in Linux I can't reproduct the issue. The struct get's copied correctly there.\n\nThis is the output from my test program:\n\n```\nStarting\nrust notification size: 24\nrust value size: 16\nInitializing library\nC++ notification size: 24\nC++ value size: 16\n 1  0  0  0  2  0  0  0  3  0  0  0  4  0  0  0  5  6  7  8  9 CC CC CC\n 1  0  0  0  2  0  0  0  3  0  0  0  4  0  0  0  5  9 48 64 80 CC CC CC\nNotification: Notification{notification_type: 1i32, value_id: Value{a: 2u32, b:\n3i32, c: 4i32, d: 5u8, e: 9u8, f: 72u8, g: 100u8}, data: 128u8}\n```\n\nThe first line is the content of the notification in bytes in C++, the second the content in Rust.\nYou can see that the last bytes of the notification structure are different in C++ in Rust. Interesting hereby is also that the last field (notification.data == 9) gets copied into notification.value_id.d (verified this with using other values for notification.data) and the remaining notification fields are garbage.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11343/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11343/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
