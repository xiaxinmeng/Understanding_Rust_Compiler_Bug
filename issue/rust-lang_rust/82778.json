(No-one really said they liked it, although that's a biased sample...)  This suggests that there would be demand for a compact output version in std.  While the docs for `std::dbg!` say the output format cannot be relied on, ISTM that changing it to remove the `#` would be rude (and controversial).  So I suggest providing a compact version in parallel.  I suggest the name `dbgc!` for \"debug compact\" but I am of course happy with whatever colour bikeshed.\r\n\r\nIf the libs team thinks this would be welcome, I will make an MR for it.  If the libs team don't like this idea then fine, I can keep using my clone-and-hack :-).\r\n\r\nWhile I'm here I notice that the docs suggest committing calls to `dbg!` is a bad idea.  grepping my own codebase showed that I agree with one significant exception: I use it liberally in tests.  I think it's great there and the docs could probably mention that as a good use case.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82778/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82778/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
