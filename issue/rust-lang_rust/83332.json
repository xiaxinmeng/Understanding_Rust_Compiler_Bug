This seems suboptimal; I'd rather not be _generating_ HTML in main.js. A lot of the toggle logic does things like check the classes of nearby items, etc, which seems super brittle.\r\n\r\nI propose we move the toggle logic to Rust code instead; writing a `wrapToggle()` method that wraps some HTML in a toggle.\r\n\r\nThoughts? @rust-lang/rustdoc \r\n\r\nMight be worth creating a meta issue for reducing the size of main.js in general. We seem to do a fair amount of additional codegen there, not just for toggles.", "closed_by": {"login": "jsha", "id": 220205, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/220205?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha", "html_url": "https://github.com/jsha", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/83332/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/83332/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
