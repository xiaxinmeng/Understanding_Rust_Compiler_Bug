If they are allowed, then I should be able to take the address of one with the type parameter filled in.  (Indeed, that should be required in order to use them.)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "jdm", "id": 27658, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjU4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27658?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdm", "html_url": "https://github.com/jdm", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdm/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdm/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdm/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdm/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdm/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdm/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jdm/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8583/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8583/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
