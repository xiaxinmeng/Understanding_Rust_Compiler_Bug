It seems the appropriate type to use for nullable function pointers, e.g. `Nullable<extern \"C\" fn (int)>`. But doing this is making the implicit assumption that `Nullable` benefits from the null-pointer optimization, i.e. that this type has the same size as `*()`. I think we should statically guarantee this by adding an attribute that guarantees that `Nullable<T>` can only be used with a type parameter that allows it to use the null-pointer optimization. This means I can say `Nullable<extern \"C\" fn (int)>`, but I can't say `Nullable<uint>`, nor `Nullable<*u32>` (because `*u32` is already nullable, and therefore the null-pointer optimization doesn't apply).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13941/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13941/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
