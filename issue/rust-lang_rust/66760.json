I worked around this by writing something close to the following (all same except for error handling that I stripped out):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n        for file in WalkDir::new(&source)\r\n            .into_iter()\r\n            .map(|file| file.unwrap())\r\n            .filter(|file| file.file_type().is_file())\r\n        {\r\n            let outpath = dest_dir_name.join(file.file_name());\r\n            std::io::copy(&mut File::open(&file.path()), &mut File::create(&outpath).unwrap()).unwrap();\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seemed strange to me that I get a permission denied despite that if I manually write the code to create and write the files using walkdir then it works completely file. I believe this is a bug in the code of std::fs::copy since the expected behavior is that it should work like `cp` (which just copies it as expected).\r\n\r\nI still have access to this setup, so I can test things if need be. Let me know if I can give more information to track down the bug.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66760/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66760/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
