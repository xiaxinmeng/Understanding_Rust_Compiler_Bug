This makes sense-- it was always possible to reach `std` in `#![no_std]` crates if you wrote `extern crate std;`, but now that `extern crate` is redundant, that is no longer necessary. Unfortunately, that also means that projects attempting to test for `#![no_std]` compatibility no longer have an easy way to check that they've correctly cut out all `std`-based dependencies.\r\n\r\nWe could special case `std` paths to not work via the \"extern prelude\". This would work, but would require projects that want to optionally use `std` (who currently use `#[cfg(feature = \"std\")] extern crate std;`) to continue using `extern crate std;`, which is awkward both because (1) it'd be the only place where `extern crate` ever gets used in the `Rust` of the future and (2) you'd have to write paths like `crate::std::...` in order to refer to your locally-mounted `extern crate std`, which is all sorts of strange.\r\n\r\nAnother option could be to make cargo and rustc aware of \"no-std-ness\" and allow some sort of flag or option which could make `std` un-linkable, perhaps usable by something like this Cargo.toml:\r\n```toml\r\n[dependencies]\r\nstd = { optional = true }\r\n\r\n[features]\r\ndefault = [\"std\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this seems like a fairly complex addition and begins to interact with the various std-aware-cargo proposals.\r\n\r\nAnother option: do nothing. This isn't a huge deal, and as @MajorBreakfast [pointed out](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/futures-rs/pull/1185#discussion_r208318846), the issue will often be caught in CI by testing against targets that don't have `std` support. There are also various proposals like [the portability lint](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/41619) that could obsolete whatever change we come up with here.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53166/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53166/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
