I haven't seen this on any stable release before.  To reproduce the issue, I'm running on Fedora 26 armv7hl, using all default options apart from enabling debuginfo.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBuilding stage0 compiler artifacts (armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf -> armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf)\r\n[...]\r\n   Compiling rustc v0.0.0 (file:///home/jistone/rust-beta/src/librustc)\r\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'\r\n  what():  std::bad_alloc\r\nerror: Could not compile `rustc`.\r\n\r\nCaused by:\r\n  process didn't exit successfully: `/home/jistone/rust-beta/build/bootstrap/debug/rustc --crate-name rustc src/librustc/lib.rs [...]` (signal: 6, SIGABRT: process abort signal)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess that C++ exception is probably LLVM running out of memory.  This excerpt is from beta sources -- on master it also errors, but without the exception info, instead a SIGSEGV.  I doubt that difference is very significant, just bad luck for who failed to allocate memory.\r\n\r\nIn either case, when I watch progress in htop, the process grows right up to 3GB virt size and then dies.  That's the limit of the 32-bit user address space, of course.  The resident size was just a little over 2GB at that time, so something is holding wasted memory here.  It could be jemalloc, or could be extra capacity in vec/map/etc. -- I'm not sure how to tell.\r\n\r\nMy workaround for now is to use `--enable-debuginfo-only-std`.\r\n\r\n(And FWIW, 32-bit i686 is not having this problem for me.)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45854/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45854/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
