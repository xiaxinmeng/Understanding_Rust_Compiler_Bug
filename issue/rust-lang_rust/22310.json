But `lexer::new_tt_reader`, for example, does not appear in the search index and (less seriously) it's a little annoying to have to jump through another set of links to another page to read the docs for that function.\n\nWhen a private item is re-exported publicly in the same crate, or a public item from another crate is re-exported, the docs are inlined and an entry is created in the search index. I think it would be reasonable to do the same for public intra-crate re-exports.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22310/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22310/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
