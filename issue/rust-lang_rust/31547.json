And I have got a question about the following sentences:\n\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1.6.0/src/doc/book/nightly-rust.md\n\n> Oh, we should also mention the officially supported platforms:\n> - Windows (7, 8, Server 2008 R2)\n> - Linux (2.6.18 or later, various distributions), x86 and x86-64\n> - OSX 10.7 (Lion) or greater, x86 and x86-64\n> \n> We extensively test Rust on these platforms, and a few others, too, like Android. But these are the ones most likely to work, as they have the most testing.\n\nI am not sure whether Android is extensively tested or not.\n\nDoes the above means the followings?\n- We _extensively_ test Rust on a few other platforms like Android in addition to the officially supported platfolms (Windows, Linux and OS X).\n- Extensive test means having the most testing, and they (Android, Windows, Linux and OS X) are likely to work. (Maybe because we are talking about nightly Rust in this chapter?)\n\nOr the followings?\n- We _extensively_ test Rust on the officially supported platfolms (Windows, Linux and OS X), and they are guaranteed to work.\n- We test a few other platforms like Android, but they have the most testing and likely to work (_not_ guaranteed to work).\n\nThanks!\n", "closed_by": {"login": "tatsuya6502", "id": 159403, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTQwMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159403?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502", "html_url": "https://github.com/tatsuya6502", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tatsuya6502/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31547/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31547/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
