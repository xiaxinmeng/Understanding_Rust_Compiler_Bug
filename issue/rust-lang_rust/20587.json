Note that this is an infinite loop\nfor _ in 0.. {\n\n}\n\n// Doesn't work. RangeTo does not implement the Iterator trait\nfor _ in ..10 {\n\n}\n```\n\nThe problem of `RangeTo` is that there is no way to know which value is considered to be zero (the old `Zero` trait was removed a couple of months ago, so we cannot add it as a bound of the ).\n\nA first solution that comes to my mind is something like\n\n```\n// This can be trivially implemented for the integer types\ntrait Enumerable : Step {\n    fn min() -> Self;\n    fn zero() -> Self;\n    fn max() -> Self;\n}\n\nimpl<Idx: Clone + Enumerable> Iterator for RangeFrom<Idx> {\n    type Item = Idx;\n\n    #[inline]\n    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Idx> {\n        let zero: Idx = Enumerable::zero();\n        // etc\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this may require an RFC and it is possible that someone has a simpler solution (I hope it).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "aochagavia", "id": 5196584, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTY1ODQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5196584?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/aochagavia", "html_url": "https://github.com/aochagavia", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aochagavia/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aochagavia/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aochagavia/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aochagavia/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aochagavia/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aochagavia/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aochagavia/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aochagavia/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aochagavia/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20587/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20587/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
