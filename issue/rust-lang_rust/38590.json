From POSIX the maximum read is SSIZE_MAX [1], although 64-bit MacOS libc is buggy and limits the read to INT_MAX [2].\r\n\r\nI tried this code on OSX 10.11.6 (El Capitan):\r\n\r\nuse std::io::prelude::*;\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let mut buf = vec![0u8; 2147483648]; // 2^31\r\n    let mut file = std::fs::OpenOptions::new().read(true).open(\"/etc/group\")\r\n                                              .unwrap();\r\n    file.read(&mut buf[..]).unwrap();\r\n}\r\n\r\nI would expect this to run happily and read the small number of bytes in /etc/group.  Instead, libc read returns -1 with the perror message \"Invalid argument\" causing the last unwrap to panic.  I can confirm that this code produces the expected result on 64-bit glibc (ubuntu 16.04).\r\n\r\nIn theory this could cause problems even on systems without a buggy libc.  A slice's maximum size is limited by usize (size_t).  On a 32-bit system it should be easy enough (about 2GiB) to create a buffer smaller than SIZE_MAX but bigger than SSIZE_MAX which would cause this problem with glibc.  I have not confirmed this.\r\n\r\nI feel that File::read should shield the user from these odd implementation issues.  Given the uncertain number of bytes read by File::read, I see no harm in capping the read size at INT_MAX or SSIZE_MAX.\r\n\r\n[0]: rust/src/libstd/sys/unix/fd.rs :40\r\n[1]: https://linux.die.net/man/2/read\r\n[2]: https://opensource.apple.com/source/Git/Git-61/src/git/wrapper.c?txt :172\r\n\r\n## Meta\r\nrustc 1.13.0\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: unknown\r\ncommit-date: unknown\r\nhost: x86_64-apple-darwin\r\nrelease: 1.13.0", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38590/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38590/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
