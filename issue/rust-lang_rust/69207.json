[This](https://github.com/silverweed/ecsde) is my project which has 3 crates: one static lib, one dynamic lib (cdylib) and an executable. \r\nThe dynamic lib (ecs_game) depends on the static lib (ecs_engine) and gets compiled into a single DLL. The executable (ecs_runner) then loads the DLL dynamically (I'm using the `libloading` crate for that).\r\nHere is what happens:\r\n- on Linux/Mac, the lib gets loaded just fine\r\n- on an old (pre-anniversary update) Windows, it gets loaded just fine\r\n- on newer Windows installations, it fails with error 126.\r\n\r\nI also tried to create a small C program that uses `LoadLibraryA` directly to load the library and it gives the same exact error.\r\nAm I doing something wrong here?\r\n\r\n(this is the C loader:)\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include <windows.h>\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n\tHMODULE lib = LoadLibraryA(\"ecsde/target/release/ecs_game.dll\");\r\n\tif (lib) {\r\n\t\tprintf(\"Hurray!\\n\");\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tDWORD last_err = GetLastError();\r\n\t\tprintf(\"Failed to load. Last err = %d\\n\", last_err);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that if I link the DLL at link-time, it works fine. It's just dynamic loading that gives problems.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "silverweed", "id": 7806878, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDY4Nzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7806878?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/silverweed", "html_url": "https://github.com/silverweed", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silverweed/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silverweed/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silverweed/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silverweed/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silverweed/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silverweed/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silverweed/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silverweed/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/silverweed/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69207/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69207/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
