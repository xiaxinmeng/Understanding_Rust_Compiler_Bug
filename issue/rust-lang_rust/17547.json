Some of these are cross-platform. But the crate also exports a large number of platform-specific APIs.\n\nIt was initially carefully organized according to various standards, but over time it has become a dumping ground for bindings.\n\nAs part of the [runtime removal RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/230) we would like to refactor the crate into smaller pieces:\n- liblibc should provide fully cross-platform C APIs. This should roughly correspond to the export list currently at the top of `liblibc/lib.rs`, and encompasses universal C bindings.\n- libunix should provide APIs that are available for any `#[cfg(unix)]` platform.\n- libwindows should provide APIs that are available for any `#[cfg(windows)]` platform.\n\nUltimately, we are likely to add additional crates like `liblinux` to provide even more specific sets of bindings.\n\nDue to the top-level exports in `liblibc`, it should be possible to do this refactoring without overly painful breakage.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/17547/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/17547/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
