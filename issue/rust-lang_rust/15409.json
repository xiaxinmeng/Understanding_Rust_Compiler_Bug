Generics, some example code is given:\n\n``` rust\nfn map<T, U>(vector: &[T], function: |v: &T| -> U) -> Vec<U> {\n    let mut accumulator = Vec::new();\n    for element in vector.iter() {\n        accumulator.push(function(element));\n    }\n    return accumulator;\n}\n\n/* [...]  */\n\nenum Option<T> {\n    Some(T),\n    None\n}\n```\n\nThis might cause problems for readers who are typing in and trying out code that the tutorial provides (which is alluded to as a way of reading the tutorial in the current introduction). The reason is that creating an enum with some constructor that is the same as one of the constructors of the `Option` type from the std module will create some weird shadowing-behaviour (see [this issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15392)). This kind of error is non-obvious, at least to a beginner, and the error message arises in the `for` loop instead of the enum declaration, making things more confusing. \n\nReplacing the `Option` example with some other artificial (not found in std module) example would mitigate this risk, but on the other hand it would not give an excuse to introduce the `Option` type and its role. \n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15409/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15409/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
