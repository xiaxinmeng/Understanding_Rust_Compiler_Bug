But it's a bit of a weird choice: why the `test` crate?\nMaybe because it's the last crate alphabetically?\n\nI think ideally it would go to `/std` instead.\n\n-----\n\nThis may be somewhat unrelated, but I also noticed that the compiler API docs\n(at `/nightly/nightly-rustc`) have a weird logo link target even when not on the\nsettings page: it goes to the `rustdoc` API docs. This one I really don't\nunderstand because the last crate alphabetically is `rustdoc_json_types`, not\n`rustdoc`.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/81986/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/81986/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
