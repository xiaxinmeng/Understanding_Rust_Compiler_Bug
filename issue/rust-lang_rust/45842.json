This would require adding (and subtracting) 1 internally to convert from the actual index into its internal representation, but it would have the bonus that we could `Option<I>` for some index type `I` would still be a single u32-sized value.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat hindered by the fact that at least one of these \"newtype'd index\" types has a public field. We should see if we can change that.\r\n\r\n(And , of course, what I *really* want is something like `Nonmax` that uses `u32::MAX` as the sentinel value, since that is not a useful index.)\r\n\r\ncc @arielb1, with whom I was discussing this general theme before. Think this could be a good idea? I'm not sure how much people really use `Option<I>`.", "closed_by": {"login": "cuviper", "id": 36186, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36186?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper", "html_url": "https://github.com/cuviper", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cuviper/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45842/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45842/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
