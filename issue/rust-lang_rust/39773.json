I've used nightlies to narrow it down to somewhere in 778988174..bf6d7b665. Specifically, the 2017-01-14 nightly is good, and 2017-01-15 is bad. The regression is independent of `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1`.\r\n\r\nIf you have a machine with a few cores, you can test it on a clone of https://github.com/mit-pdos/distributary/. Run with\r\n```console\r\n$ cargo run -v --release --bin vote -- --avg --articles=100000 --runtime=10 --migrate=3 soup:// | grep 'PUT+'\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn `-14`, the \"migration\" mentioned in the middle finishes quite quickly. On `-15`, it takes a long time, and so `PUT` never transitions to `PUT+`.\r\n\r\nI wanted to try a `git bisect` to narrow the problem down further, but compiling it takes *forever*. A cursory glance over the commit range doesn't reveal anything particularly suspect, and `#rust-internals` told me to post here to get some more eyes on the problem.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39773/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39773/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
