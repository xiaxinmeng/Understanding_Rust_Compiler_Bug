So the problem is, that we have a lot of smaller projects that are not in a workspace but still want a unified list of lints that are denied or allowed. Adding this list to every `lib.rs` or `main.rs` is not viable as this would require constant updating of all lint lists in case we can deny an allowed lint that is forbidden in a group after fixing the cause.\r\n\r\nWe're using protobuf in one of the projects and this allows me to test this bug with\r\n`RUSTFLAGS=\"--deny rust-2018-idioms --allow elided-lifetimes-in-paths\" cargo check`. The anonymous lifetime lint still pops up even though it should be allowed.\r\n\r\nHaving\r\n```\r\n#[deny(rust_2018_idioms)]\r\n#[allow(elided_lifetimes_in_paths)]\r\n```\r\nin the `lib.rs`/`main.rs` works as expected.\r\n\r\nIs this indeed a bug or expected behaviour?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Oh and I nearly forgot, here's my `rustc --version --verbose` output:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.32.0 (9fda7c223 2019-01-16)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 9fda7c2237db910e41d6a712e9a2139b352e558b\r\ncommit-date: 2019-01-16\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.32.0\r\nLLVM version: 8.0\r\n```", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58211/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58211/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
