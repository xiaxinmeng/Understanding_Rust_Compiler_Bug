It would be nice to at least have tests for basic forms of each item, as well as any known issues. A quick list of things not really tested (non-exhaustive):\r\n\r\n- [ ] Impls\r\n- [ ] Associated Items\r\n- [ ] Consts/Statics\r\n- [ ] Extern items (all forms)\r\n- [ ] Macros\r\n- [ ] Types\r\n\r\nIt also would be nice to know the desired layout of the tests. Currently, the directory holds the form\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n| structs\r\n- | plain\r\n  | tuple\r\n  | generic\r\n| traits\r\n- | has_body\r\n| unions\r\n- | plain\r\n| ...\r\n```\r\nThis is slightly different from how normal rustdoc ui tests are structured, but on the other hand HTML output is very different and serves a somewhat different goal. If we want to establish guidelines on the test directory layout, now is a good time to discuss it, before the directories fill up.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/81359/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/81359/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
