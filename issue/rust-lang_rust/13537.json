It's a shame having to import the traits just to make a simple server.\n- [ ] Does the layout make sense? `std::io::net::ip` is quite long. Possibly a top-level `net` module? Possibly shorten using reexports?\n- [x] What more needs to be exported? The current primitives implement the basic Reader/Writer traits, but not much beyond that. There are many methods provided by librustuv/libnative which are not exported. Need to make sure the signatures are correct.\n- [ ] \"Unix pipes\" are not unix pipes on windows (they are named pipes)\n\nWish list\n- [ ] `TcpStream::open(\"google.com:80\")` does not work\n- [x] I can clone a tcp stream, but I cannot close that duplicate tcp stream (from my owned stream)\n- [ ] Creating a server is quite wordy. There are a number of imports, lots of ip addr configuration, lots of listening/accepting, etc.\n\nNominating, I believe it is quite important to have a solid networking story.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13537/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13537/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
