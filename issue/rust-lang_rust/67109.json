While this seems incredibly large for a shared library, it's still only slightly larger than `librustc_driver` (63MB).\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunate, but things become much worse when `llvm.release-debuginfo=true` is set in `config.toml.` This makes `libLLVM-9-rust-1.41.0-dev-de1a7dbf6.so` take up **2.1 GB** of space.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, we currently copy `libLLVM.so` to a target directory when building the compiler: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/ae1b871cca56613b1af1a5121dd24ac810ff4b89/src/bootstrap/dist.rs#L2167\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67077, we may have to copy it into even *more* places. This represents a non-trivial amount of disk space.\r\n\r\nI don't think there's much we can directly do about the size of `libLLVM.so`, other than making sure upstream is aware of this. However, we might want to consider symlinking `libLLVM.so`, rather than copying it. I know this works for shared libraries on Linux, but I'm not sure about other platforms.\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/67109/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/67109/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "not_planned"}
