We should have a document somewhere that explains how they work internally.\r\n\r\nWe used to have a very short sketch of that in the dev-guide, but it was removed in https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/1483/commits/552de587a740d388a48726fe427b9c690927c79c because it wasn't clear that it was an implementation detail and not user-facing.\r\n\r\nMy short summary (I'll try and update this later):\r\n- Queries are defined in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b0f3940c35d565399dccf8c79f38147b40f2724a/compiler/rustc_middle/src/query/mod.rs#L1-L5 using the `rustc_queries` macro.\r\n- `rustc_queries` is defined in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b0f3940c35d565399dccf8c79f38147b40f2724a/compiler/rustc_macros/src/query.rs#L293 It outputs another `rustc_query_append` macro, as well as two modules: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b0f3940c35d565399dccf8c79f38147b40f2724a/compiler/rustc_macros/src/query.rs#L357-L374\r\n- `rustc_query_append` is called in various places around the compiler. It takes *another* macro as its input, then calls that macro with the token stream emitted by `rustc_queries`. This emulates eager expansion.\r\n- The primary callers of `rustc_query_append` are `rustc_middle::define_callbacks` https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/d933092dc507b11a7e5013616128161a76c6f113/compiler/rustc_middle/src/ty/query.rs#L177 and `rustc_query_impl::define_queries` https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/24ce4cfa205da0afc8500684465bf8158bd4adae/compiler/rustc_query_impl/src/plumbing.rs#L444\r\n\r\nThere are 3 main crates involved in defining queries, other than rustc_macros.\r\n1. `rustc_query_system` comes earliest in the dependency graph. It defines various traits along with some helper functions. It is very fast to compile. We may want to rename this to rustc_query_traits at some point.\r\n2. `rustc_middle` comes next and depends on query_system. It defines TyCtxt and various helper functions that are used elsewhere in the compiler; this is the first place we can invoke `rustc_queries`, since before this we don't have access to TyCtxt. This is slow to compile but not because of the query system, it's just big.\r\n3. `rustc_query_impl` depends on rustc_middle. It implements the traits in rustc_query_system for the queries declared in rustc_middle. It takes an extremely long time to compile.\r\n\r\nBecause query_impl takes so long to compile, we don't depend on it anywhere except for rustc_interface. In particular, we use function pointers and dynamic dispatch as necessary so that rustc_middle and later crates don't need to depend on query internals.\r\n\r\ncc @cjgillot @Nilstrieb", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/104011/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/104011/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
