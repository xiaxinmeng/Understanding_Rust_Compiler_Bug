I had expected `repr(C)` in rust do to the same (especially having read the part above from the reference) and was surprised it didn't. As I assume that some code somewhere relies on `u64` being aligned to 8 bytes on that target, should the documentation in the reference be changed to reflect this difference?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/reference/issues/1235/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/reference/issues/1235/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
