This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library API team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncomment period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Alternative: `#[must_use]` on an arbitrary block or expression?\r\n\r\n    ```rust\r\n    #[must_use]\r\n    {\r\n        some_expr\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    This feels more native, and might behave slightly better in some subtle edge cases&mdash;type inference may not always 'see through' the identity function in terms of whether unsize coercions occur before or after the call, whereas through a block that isn't an issue.\r\n\r\n    Blocked on #15701.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Alternative: `#[must_use]` integrated into macro_rules, perhaps on each arm, or on the whole macro, perhaps with a lint or error if the macro does not produce an expression.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94745/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94745/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
