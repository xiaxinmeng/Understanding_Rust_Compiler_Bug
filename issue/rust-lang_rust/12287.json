Generally, the only new language features added after this milestone must be backwards compatible, or to fix soundness holes, though we do expect to have some leeway to make small incompatible fixes that have low impact on existing code bases.\r\n\r\n* Library stability - We have a system of measuring and ensuring the stability of API's, and a significant portion of the standard library is declared stable. Stable API's will not change. Large portions of the standard library need to be stable for 1.0, including primitive types, vectors, strings, option, numerics, collections, some I/O and concurrency.\r\n\r\n* User experience - The system is polished and the presentation is complete and professional. New users have a clear path to using and learning the system. This encompasses the web site, documentation, installation, and tooling.\r\n", "creator": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 376, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2013-10-10T18:48:33Z", "updated_at": "2016-08-28T23:13:24Z", "due_on": "2015-05-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2015-05-21T20:59:13Z"}, "comments": 7, "created_at": "2014-02-15T09:09:34Z", "updated_at": "2014-03-25T23:15:35Z", "closed_at": "2014-03-25T23:15:35Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Simple example:\n\n``` rust\n// a.rs\n#[crate_type=\"lib\"];\n#[link(name=\"aaa\")] extern {}\n\n// b.rs\n#[crate_type=\"lib\"];\nextern mod a;\n#[link(name=\"bbb\")] extern {}\n\n// c.rs\nextern mod a; // not really relevant to this issue, does not change the behavior here\nextern mod b;\nfn main() {}\n```\n\nWhen compiled with `rustc a.rs && rustc -L. b.rs && rustc -L. c.rs`, this obviously results in the linker error, but multiple trials reveal the random order of `-laaa` and `-lbbb`. If `libbbb.a` depends on `libaaa.a` then `-laaa` should be put before `-lbbb`; the current behavior is not acceptable for the purpose of FFI.\n\nSome practical problem caused by this issue: If the external library (say, `-lsqlite3`) depends on libc (`-lc`) and the binding crate for that library is compiled as rlib, then the executable crate using those library and crate will randomly fail to link since we no longer implicitly link to `-lc` (#12205) and thus the order of `-lc` and `-lsqlite3` is random. (We do still have `-lc` since libstd depends on libc.)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12287/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12287/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
