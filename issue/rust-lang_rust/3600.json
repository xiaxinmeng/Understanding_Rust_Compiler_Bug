I am frankly unsure if these rules are good or bad but I do believe they are to some extent accidental.  We should decide when and if impls are visible.\n\nFor example, I could imagine any of the following rules:\n- the rule we have now;\n- impls of traits are always visible;\n- impls of traits are subject to the typical visibility rules, meaning that if the impl is public in module A, it can only be used from modules that could import A.\n\nSome related questions:\n- currently coherence is enforced at the crate level.  You can implement an impl for trait T and type X if it is T or X is defined in your crate.  Module-level visibility has nothing to do with it.\n- if we went with module-level visibility rules, does it interact with coherence at all?  I guess it cannot, we still do not want to allow multiple impls of a given trait for a given type.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pcwalton", "id": 157897, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton", "html_url": "https://github.com/pcwalton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3600/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3600/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
