So far it has been awesome!\r\n\r\nI was thinking that it would be great to see unmangled symbols in the wasm output on the playground.  From the wasm spec ([name section] and [name encoding]) symbol names are encoded in utf8.  Would it be possible to disable name mangling for wasm targets?  This is something I may be able to contribute if pointed in the right direction.\r\n\r\nAlso, what do you think it would take to enable local variable names in wasm output?\r\n\r\n[name section]: https://webassembly.github.io/spec/appendix/custom.html#name-section\r\n[name encoding]: https://webassembly.github.io/spec/binary/values.html#names\r\n\r\ncc @shepmaster ", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46389/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 1, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46389/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
