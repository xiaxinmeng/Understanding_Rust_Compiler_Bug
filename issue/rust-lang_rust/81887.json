I've noticed a strange behaviour where rust-analyzer and rustc would disagree what was wrong with my code. Turns out neither of them were right, I've had an \"ambiguous name\" problem however both rustc and rust-analyzer resolved the type anyway and they chose a different type to disambiguate into.\r\n\r\nI've managed to make [this](https://play.rust-lang.org/?mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=d54ca5e48494529b76ea69468085f29b&version=stable) minimal reproduction.\r\nI can either remove the derives or remove the indirection through the `c` module and the problem will go away.\r\n\r\nI expected to get a \"`Foo` is ambiguous\" error, instead i get an error for one of the usages of `Foo` which doesn't match the resolved type of `Foo`.\r\n\r\nAs a side-note, at least for rustc the resolved type seems to be dependent on the lexical order of the module/type definitions (not reexports), if that helps at all.\r\n\r\nI get the same result on both nightly and stable, locally and on the playground. I found these issues #56593 and #62769 which sound similar but the problem there seems to be the opposite - \"type doesn't resolve when it should\" (in the presence of derive) instead of here \"type resolves when it shouldn't\".\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "estebank", "id": 1606434, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY0MzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1606434?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank", "html_url": "https://github.com/estebank", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/81887/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/81887/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
