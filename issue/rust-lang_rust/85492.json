Perhaps even better would be to put horizontal bars between impls in the sidebar.\r\n\r\nIt would also be nice to have more context when you jump directly to one method of a struct that has multiple impls. The context should ideally indicate \"this is for impl X; there are N impls for this struct,\" but I'm not sure exactly how it should look.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85492/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85492/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
