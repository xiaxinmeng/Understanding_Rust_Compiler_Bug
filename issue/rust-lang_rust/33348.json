It also forces the trait's implementors to write lowering code (as can be seen in the current implementation of `json_dumper`).\n### Proposed solution\n1. Create a new module in `save-analysis` called `external_data` where the new `*Data` structs will live (they can be moved from `json_dumper`, along with the lowering code).\n2. Modify the `Dump` trait to operate on `save_analysis::external_data::*` instead of on `save_analysis::data::*`.\n### Some open problems\n\nWhen getting a `DefId` from a `NodeId`, what should we do when `tcx.map.opt_local_def_id(node_id)` returns `None`? What does that mean? If we call the function with a `NodeId` provided by the compiler, should it always succeed? The current code doesn't make that assumption (see [data.rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e1a575cb077d2070cc4527fa43bf9ef790f89f04/src/librustc_save_analysis/data.rs#L370))\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33348/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33348/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
