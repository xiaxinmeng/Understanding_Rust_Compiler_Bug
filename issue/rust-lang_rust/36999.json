In particular I'm referring to a long-ago comment from Huon that he was working on an overhaul of the rand lib, which has somewhat served to stall outside progress on the lib.\n\nI bring this up now because an old colleague of mine, @bhickey (who has already submitted several PRs to rand, e.g. https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand/pull/113 ), has expressed interest in taking stewardship of the rand crate, but our enthusiasm is dampened by rand's limbo-ness. Specifically it's uncertain whether someone on the libs team has already decided to take stewardship of the rand crate, or whether there is a consensus on whether the current rand crate ought to be moved to rust-lang-deprecated pending a total overhaul of the API (as some people seemed to almost imply last year).\n\nIf the libs team is receptive, I'm sure bhickey would be happy to discuss potential changes to the API with any interested parties. And if someone on the libs team has already decided to tackle this themselves, I can vouch that bhickey is about as close to an expert on random number generation as we are likely to find, and could provide valuable consultation on any future redesign.\n\n(As to the question of why not just work on an external rand crate for now, well, yes, that is what we intend to do, but IMO prospects for large-scale adoption are bleak when it comes to competing with pseudo-blessed libs (e.g. how much effort we continue to put into evangelizing Serde, which still seems to see less real-world use than rustc-serialize).)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36999/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36999/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
