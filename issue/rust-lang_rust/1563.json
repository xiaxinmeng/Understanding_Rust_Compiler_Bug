Debuggers will want to be able to bypass the abstraction barrier and see the hidden implementation.\n2. They are also likely to want to be able to see the vtable.\n   - I am not sure how flexible the debug format is for gdb, but newer versions of gdb do support printing the vtable for C++ objects (via `info vtbl` or perhaps `info vtable`).  It would be cool if we could massage our debug info so that gdb can just print out our vtables too, the same way.\n### Original description\n\nThere is none.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1563/reactions", "total_count": 8, "+1": 8, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1563/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
