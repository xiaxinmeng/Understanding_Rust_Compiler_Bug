This limits API design: a trait like `C` cannot retroactively have a base trait with associated type like `A` added, and in any case requiring all users to write `C<X = u32>` or equivalent is undesirable.\r\n\r\n*Possibly* such a change warrants an RFC, though since the extra type specification is redundant, not requiring it is not a breaking change. Making this change would however mean that an API cannot relax a constraint like `X = u32` without the change being breaking (if a library uses `trait C: A<X = u32>` in its API but envisages switching to `trait C: A` in the future \u2014 seems unlikely).", "closed_by": {"login": "dhardy", "id": 134893, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy", "html_url": "https://github.com/dhardy", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57218/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57218/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
