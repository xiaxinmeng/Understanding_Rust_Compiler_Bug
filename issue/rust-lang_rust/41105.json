the only reason I upgraded to 1.16 was that I wanted `cargo check` for development, but upstream projects using my crate use 1.15 for CI, recommended version, etc; consequently, when 1.16 was released I noted that there were no major compiler fixes in this cycle, or major issues in compatibility notes, etc., which would cause a difference between a client compiling on 1.15 versus 1.16, so it should be safe to develop on 1.16 stable for cargo check;
