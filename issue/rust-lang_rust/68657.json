I had an issue with some (admittedly poor) code that seemed to behave differently in release and debug builds.\r\n\r\nHere is a short repro of the offending code: https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=release&edition=2018&gist=744b3dd0e3a8171675a1f2969c370915\r\n\r\nIn a debug build, this code will work as expected. In a release build, this code will sleep for an uncertain amount of time (or more likely be killed by the playground).\r\n\r\nIf both arms of the match return a `&timespec`, the issue becomes clear, and the compiler catches it correctly: https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=b788f0170f6d876aae8fc856d562b34f\r\n\r\nIt looks like the `timespec` in my example doesn't live long enough, and so may be freed (or even optimized out) in a release build.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!", "closed_by": {"login": "worr", "id": 183837, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzgzNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183837?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/worr", "html_url": "https://github.com/worr", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/worr/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/worr/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/worr/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/worr/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/worr/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/worr/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/worr/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/worr/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/worr/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/68657/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/68657/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
