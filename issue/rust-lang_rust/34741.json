In case it matters, I have two Xcode toolchains installed and therefore two `clang` versions \u2013\u00a0the current stable Xcode 7.3 and the Xcode 8.0 beta. I tried each operation below once with each toolchain selected using `xcode-select`; there was no difference.\n\nI tried to get started with Rust this afternoon without much luck.\n\nFirst I tried to build it from source with `brew install rust` but after six hours of waiting for the compulation step to complete, with `rustc` using 100% CPU (on a current-model MacBook Pro, with `brew doctor` showing no issues other than the beta macOS warning), I decided that maybe I should download a binary package, so I downloaded the current 64-bit Mac OS X .pkg from rust-lang.org and installed this successfully.\n\nThen I tried to start my first project with `cargo new mylib --lib`. It has hung for 30 minutes so far (`top` shows `rustc` using 100% CPU) and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about to complete.\n\nIf I run `rustc --version` from the command line, I get:\n\n```\nmacbook-pro% rustc --version\nrustc(75943,0x7fffa5a1c3c0) malloc: *** malloc_zone_unregister() failed for 0x7fffa5a13548\n```\n\n\u2026 and it proceeds to use 100% CPU until I kill it.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34741/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34741/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
