You might want to read the other sections first and then come back to this one.\r\n\r\nOn the other, SGX is sort of abusing rustdoc here. Maybe we should suggest using modules to group the docs instead of impl blocks?\r\n\r\nThe other issue is that if rustdoc does this, it will look very strange for impls without a doc-comment.\r\n\r\ncc @jethrogb, git says you wrote those docs.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80713/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80713/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
