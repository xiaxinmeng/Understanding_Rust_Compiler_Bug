For example, look at how the Java documentation is structured (C++ docs on multiple mainstream sites are similar): http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html\n\nThere is a high level overview of the class, a list of methods with one line descriptions, followed by the same function list with more detailed descriptions. The list of methods links to the more detailed descriptions.\n\nThis structure allows a user who doesn't know the exact name of the method they're looking for quickly find the method. Contrast this with the current way rustdoc does things. Look at this page: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html\n\nI have to sift through all the functions and their descriptions as I look for the function I want. The functions aren't alphabetized either, so if I am looking for a function, I can't find it alphabetically.\n\nI don't know whether it would be good to show Traits methods in this list or not.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15642/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15642/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
