I thought that it was my fault until I switched back to the stable compiler and the produced binary never hangs. The CLOEXEC error would occur sometimes when spawning a `Child` with it's stdout and stderr piped, and the program would often hang as it would be stuck looping over 'Bad File Descriptor' when trying to read from the process's `ChildStdout`\n\n```\nthread '<unnamed>' panicked at 'the CLOEXEC pipe failed: Error { repr: Os { code: 9, message: \"Bad file descriptor\" } }', ../src/libstd/sys/unix/process.rs:269\n```\n\nYou can try it out on your end by compiling my [Parallel program](https://github.com/mmstick/parallel) and executing the following:\n\n``` sh\ntarget/debug/parallel echo ::: 0 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9\n```\n\nWith the stable compiler, no hanging.
