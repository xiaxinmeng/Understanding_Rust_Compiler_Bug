However, these are either platform specific (gcov/kcov are linux only), or incomplete (coverage for documentation tests is not collected).\n\nIt would be better if rustc would be able to instrument rust binaries and tests using [LLVM Coverage Instrumentation](http://llvm.org/docs/CoverageMappingFormat.html). This would allow code coverage information to work portably across the supported platforms, as well as produce reliable coverage information.\n\nIdeally, such support would be integrated in an easy to use `cargo coverage` subcommand and the Rust Language Server, such that IDEs can use this information to guide the user while writing tests.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "wesleywiser", "id": 831192, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjgzMTE5Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/831192?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser", "html_url": "https://github.com/wesleywiser", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34701/reactions", "total_count": 90, "+1": 65, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 19, "rocket": 6, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34701/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
