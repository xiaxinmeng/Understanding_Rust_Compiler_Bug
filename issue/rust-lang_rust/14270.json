Generally, the only new language features added after this milestone must be backwards compatible, or to fix soundness holes, though we do expect to have some leeway to make small incompatible fixes that have low impact on existing code bases.\r\n\r\n* Library stability - We have a system of measuring and ensuring the stability of API's, and a significant portion of the standard library is declared stable. Stable API's will not change. Large portions of the standard library need to be stable for 1.0, including primitive types, vectors, strings, option, numerics, collections, some I/O and concurrency.\r\n\r\n* User experience - The system is polished and the presentation is complete and professional. New users have a clear path to using and learning the system. This encompasses the web site, documentation, installation, and tooling.\r\n", "creator": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 376, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2013-10-10T18:48:33Z", "updated_at": "2016-08-28T23:13:24Z", "due_on": "2015-05-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2015-05-21T20:59:13Z"}, "comments": 33, "created_at": "2014-05-18T02:45:52Z", "updated_at": "2018-08-04T05:21:21Z", "closed_at": "2015-03-31T08:43:25Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "With `Box` built deeply into the compiler, one can currently write\n\n``` rust\nlet mut y = 1;\nlet x: Box<&mut int> = box &mut y;\n**x = 2;\n```\n\nThat is, one can mutate through a `&mut` stored in the `Box`, even if the `Box` itself is not in a mutable slot. This is (presumably) because the compiler currently understands a lot about `Box`s behaviour, in particular, that it can act like an immutable unaliased pointer (`&uniq`).\n\nThere's currently no way to get this behaviour for library types, e.g. `Vec<&mut int>` is theoretically identical to `Box` in terms of ownership/aliasability of its contents, but, as it is a library type, the following cannot be made to work:\n\n``` rust\nlet mut y = 1;\nlet x: Vec<&mut int> = vec![&mut y];\n// error: can't mutate a `& &mut int`\n**x.get(0) = 2;\n// error: can't borrow x as mutable\n**x.get_mut(0) = 2;\n```\n\nWe would need an immutable `&uniq` pointer for this behaviour to be possible for general simply-owned types like an in-library `Box`, `Vec`, `HashMap` etc.\n\nHaving this behaviour for `Box` represents a possible backwards compatibility hazard if we ever decide to move `Box` more into libraries. Specifically, moving `Box` into a library and preserving its current behaviour perfectly would require (at least) adding this new `&uniq` pointer type.\n\n(Thanks to /u/SteveMcQwark on reddit for prompting this.)\n\n(Nominating.)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/14270/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/14270/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
