Let\u2019s talk about `&str` first. These are called \u2018string slices\u2019. String literals are of the type `&'static str`...\n\nThe problem is that a beginner who reads these lines can make a false conclusion that  \"string slice\" and \"string literal\" mean the same thing, and string slices always has a static lifetime.\n\nComment from newcomer:\n\n> In fact, there is mention of the fact that the slices may has different lifetimes in the book. But from the point of view of a beginner there is no difference between \"string slice\" and \"string literal\", because these terms are used in the book **as if they are synonymous**. When I read these lines I always thought that these terms mean the same thing.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29823/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29823/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
