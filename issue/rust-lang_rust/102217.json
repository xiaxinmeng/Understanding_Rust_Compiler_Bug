This warning did not appear in the previous version of the Rust Compiler. This is not present in the changelog for 1.64, so I do not believe it to be an expected change.\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n\r\nI tried this code:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[pin_project(project = Merge2Proj)]\r\n#[derive(Debug)]\r\npub struct Merge2\r\n{\r\n\t// struct contents...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// impl that only makes use of Merge2Proj::project...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected to see this happen: I expected the code to compile without warnings, as was true for the previous compiler version.\r\n\r\nInstead, this happened: I get a `dead_code` warning from inside the `pin_project` macro expansion, telling me that `Merge2Proj::project_ref` is unused. This warning is impossible for me to remove, as I have no need for `project_ref` and there is no way to tell `pin_project` to not generate it.\r\n\r\n### Version it worked on\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nProvide the most recent version this worked on, for example:\r\n\r\nIt most recently worked on: Rust 1.47\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt most recently worked on: 1.63\r\n\r\n### Version with regression\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nProvide the version you are using that has the regression.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.64.0 (a55dd71d5 2022-09-19)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: a55dd71d5fb0ec5a6a3a9e8c27b2127ba491ce52\r\ncommit-date: 2022-09-19\r\nhost: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\r\nrelease: 1.64.0\r\nLLVM version: 14.0.6\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf you know when this regression occurred, please add a line like below, replacing `{channel}` with one of stable, beta, or nightly.\r\n\r\n@rustbot modify labels: +regression-from-stable-to-{channel} -regression-untriaged\r\n-->\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/102217/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/102217/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
