It then lists a bunch of structs that seem promising.  Things like `struct Matches` \"created with the method `.matches()`\"\n\nBut then I see no method list.  And the text \"created with the method `.matches()`\" does not have a hyperlink to that method.  Following the link to the page for `struct Matches` does not help.  (I can imagine reasons why we would not want to flood the embedded identifiers with hyperlinks; I'm just pointing out that one reasonable guess at how to find this method does not work out.)\n\nAnyway, perhaps a lot of this confusion would be reduced if, at the very beginning of the documentation for `mod str`, we included a prominent link to the primitive `str` documentation page, which _does_ have all of these methods.\n\n---\n\nBut, there is a twist (which perhaps should be a different bug).\n- `mod str`: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/index.html\n- note that this is distinct from primitive `str`: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html\n\nBoth of these pages start off with the exact same text.  Apart from the respective titles (\"Module std::str\" versus \"Primitive Type str\"), there is no visible difference in my web browser which is filling its vertical space on my laptop, because the differences only start after the \"Representation\" section, and I need to scroll to see that.\n\nThis is not great, because someone who is following links trying to find the right page after starting from the `mod str` docs might reasonably think that this link took them _back to_ the `mod str` docs.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28014/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28014/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
