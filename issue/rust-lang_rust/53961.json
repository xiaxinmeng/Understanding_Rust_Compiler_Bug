I have two ways in mind:\r\n\r\n- Use a right sidebar. Sidebar allows you to collapse things by group not per item. It also has a smaller font size, allowing more items to fit in the screen.\r\n- Make the brief link to everything available in the page. Rust pseudocode is easier to read for some people (including me).\r\n\r\nTo compare these two approaches, sidebar is more suitable for continuously navigating items without caring the backstack, while the brief is more like \"navigate, read, back, navigate, read, back\".\r\n\r\nRelated: #39952", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53961/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53961/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
