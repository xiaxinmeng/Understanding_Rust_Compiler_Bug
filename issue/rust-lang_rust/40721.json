(Yes, *you* can and should do this!).\r\n\r\n- Check [the PR queue](https://buildbot2.rust-lang.org/homu/queue/rust) for build failures, find the failed build, and extract out the information onto a comment on the PR.\r\n\r\n## Medium\r\n\r\n- ~~[Travis: add a tool to print timestamp for log messages](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/40577)~~\r\n\r\n- [Switch AppVeyor to use Docker](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/40711)\r\n\r\n- ~~[Set up CI testing for asm.js and wasm](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38801)~~\r\n\r\n## Hard\r\n\r\n- [Spurious build failures]. These are currently *extremely* difficult to track down, due to the inability to reproduce locally or to log into the build machines. They are thus also **very high value** bugs to close.

Oversees CI/releases and nagbox. Set up using Docker.\r\n  - Maintained by @alexcrichton\r\n\r\n- [homu]. The bot behind @bors. Hooks into the above CI infrastructure to actually land PRs.\r\n\r\n- [rfcbot]. A bot for managing the FCP process of RFCs and tracking issues.\r\n  - Maintained by @dikaiosune\r\n\r\n- [rusty-dash]. A dashboard tracking a number of metrics for Rust and its community.\r\n  - Maintained by @dikaiosune\r\n\r\n- [highfive]. A bot that welcomes new contributors and randomly assigns reviewing duties.\r\n  - Maintained by @nrc.\r\n\r\n- [nagbot].
