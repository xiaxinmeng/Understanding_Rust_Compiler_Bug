Currently the `Chain` struct has two private fields `a` and `b` for the two chained iterators. Any implementor of `FromIterator` has no access to this individual iterators and so can not optimise the chain into two separate loops - one using the `FromIterator` trait and the second utilizing `Extend` for example. The compiler seems to struggle optimising a `from_iter` call if the iterator is a `iterator::Chain`\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest a new trait called `ChainedIterator` that implements a split function. Implementors of `FromIterator` can then specialise on this trait to give the compiler more chance to optimise.\r\n\r\nWill this require a RFC or can I just submit a pull request?", "closed_by": {"login": "josephDunne", "id": 1827457, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mjc0NTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1827457?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephDunne", "html_url": "https://github.com/josephDunne", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephDunne/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephDunne/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephDunne/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephDunne/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephDunne/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephDunne/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephDunne/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephDunne/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josephDunne/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47491/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47491/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
