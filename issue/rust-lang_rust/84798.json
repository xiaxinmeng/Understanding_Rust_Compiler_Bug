I have this complicated crate with several impl blocks spread across several files, and previously the documentation would look like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32419308/116796211-763b0200-aaa0-11eb-82ae-22e6207b3d5f.png)\r\n\r\nbut now looks like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32419308/116796246-9965b180-aaa0-11eb-8348-c644c25cb96f.png)\r\n\r\nIf I want to quickly scan through all the sections, I have to click every single section and expand them every time I open up that documentation page. I think I could see a reason for changing the non-trait impls to also start contracted as default, but now there are no bold titles delimiting the different sections (`Miscellanious`, `Multiplication`, `Division`, etc). I think there needs to be some kind of attribute to make impls expanded by default and/or some way to hoist the impl titles on the different impls.", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84798/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84798/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
