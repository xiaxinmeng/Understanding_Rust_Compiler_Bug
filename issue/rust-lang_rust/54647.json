These runtime crates, however, sometimes also want to invoke the procedural macro itself (think `panic!` and libstd, which exports it for users and also defines it itself).\r\n\r\nLet's say our runtime crate is called `foo`. The macro today generally expands to paths that look like `::foo::MyType`. This doesn't work by default in the crate `foo` itself, so `foo` typically includes a module that looks like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nmod foo { pub use super::*; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the enables the crate `foo` to use its own macros internally.\r\n\r\nIn the 2018 edition, however, the `::foo::MyType` path unconditionally requires `foo` to be a crate, which isn't the case when we're compiling `foo`! As a result, these sorts of runtime crates don't have a great path forward when migrating to the 2018 edition.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54647/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54647/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
