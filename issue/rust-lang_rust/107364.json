Right now, `port_gone_concurrent` is failing:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[test]\r\nfn port_gone_concurrent() {\r\n    let (tx, rx) = channel::<i32>();\r\n    let _t = thread::spawn(move || {\r\n        rx.recv().unwrap();\r\n    });\r\n    while tx.send(1).is_ok() {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs expected, `rx.recv().unwrap()` executes, sees the channel has no data, and suspends. It does this by parking using the generic parker interface which involves waiting on a condvar. It successfully sends the request to `wait()`.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, `tx.send(1)` is executed. Because of the current quantum, this is allowed to execute quite a lot. In fact, it executes over two million times, which easily eats up the eight megabytes of RAM. The other thread does not execute because it is waiting on a condvar.\r\n\r\nWhat appears to happen is the `rx` thread registers itself as a `selector` using `self.receivers.register(oper, cx)`, but the `tx` thread seems to query the `observers`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the `observers` field never appears to actually be used.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n\r\nThis is based off Rust nightly 496928c274a438558fe165c110c57a7cb583b308", "closed_by": {"login": "xobs", "id": 238325, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzODMyNQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/238325?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/xobs", "html_url": "https://github.com/xobs", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xobs/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xobs/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xobs/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xobs/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xobs/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xobs/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xobs/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xobs/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xobs/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/107364/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/107364/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
