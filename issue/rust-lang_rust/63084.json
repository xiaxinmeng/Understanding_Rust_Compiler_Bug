It is not clear whether this is sound. Needs some T-lang discussion probably, too.\r\n\r\nSteps needed:\r\n\r\n* [x] Implementation (essentially add `const` and `#[rustc_const_unstable(feature = \"const_type_name\")` to the function and add tests showing that it works at compile-time.\r\n* [ ] fix https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/94187\r\n* [ ] check if https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/97156 replicates for `type_name`, too\r\n* [ ] Stabilization\r\n\t* Note that stabilization isn't happening any time soon. This function can change its output between rustc compilations and allows breaking referential transparency. Doing so at compile-time has not been discussed fully and has various points that are problematic.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63084/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63084/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
