This line:\n\n``` rust\nlet _:Option<~fn()> = Some(|| { });\n```\n\ngives this error message: \n\n``` text\nerror: mismatched types: expected `std::option::Option<~fn:Send()>` but found `std::option::Option<&fn<no-bounds>()>` (expected ~ closure, found & closure)\n```\n\nThe problem is that the function inside the `Some` is interpreted to be a &fn rather than a ~fn, and then the compiler complains about a type mismatch.  The only way to make it work is this to make it `Some::<~fn()>(|| { })` instead.  But when the function isn't just `~fn()` and has parameters and a return type, that becomes extremely annoying.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "MicahChalmer", "id": 698400, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY5ODQwMA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/698400?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/MicahChalmer", "html_url": "https://github.com/MicahChalmer", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MicahChalmer/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MicahChalmer/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MicahChalmer/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MicahChalmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MicahChalmer/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MicahChalmer/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MicahChalmer/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MicahChalmer/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MicahChalmer/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9409/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9409/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
