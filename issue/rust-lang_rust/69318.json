One crate in the workspace produces a `ruby` binary. Another crate has a build script that does a `std::process::Command` subprocess with the `ruby` binary (expected to be system Ruby). `target/debug/deps` is prepended to the PATH for build scripts on Windows.\r\n\r\nI expected to see this happen: On mac and linux, binaries produced by the workspace end up only in `target/debug`. `target/debug/deps` only contains `rlib`, `meta`, and debug symbols for dependent crates. I expect the subshell invoked in the build script to not see workspace artifacts on Windows as is the case on mac and linux.\r\n\r\nInstead, this happened: On Windows, the workspace built binaries end up in `target/debug/deps` in addition to `target/debug`. This resolves the workspace `ruby` first, which breaks the build script. This means that building more than once fails.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n<!--\r\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\r\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.41.0 (5e1a79984 2020-01-27)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 5e1a799842ba6ed4a57e91f7ab9435947482f7d8\r\ncommit-date: 2020-01-27\r\nhost: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\r\nrelease: 1.41.0\r\nLLVM version: 9.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a backtrace in the code block by setting `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` in your\r\nenvironment.
