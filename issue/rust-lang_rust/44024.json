Making the type's relationships more obvious in the above way would complement the doc comments.\r\n\r\nExample: This page for [DeviceHandle](https://dcuddeback.github.io/libusb-rs/libusb/struct.DeviceHandle.html) would have a link to [Context.html::open_device_with_vid_pid](https://dcuddeback.github.io/libusb-rs/libusb/struct.Context.html#method.open_device_with_vid_pid()) and [Device::open()](https://dcuddeback.github.io/libusb-rs/libusb/struct.Device.html#method.open) and the page for [Device](https://dcuddeback.github.io/libusb-rs/libusb/struct.Device.html) would have a link to the [Iterator impl for Devices](https://dcuddeback.github.io/libusb-rs/libusb/struct.Devices.html) and the page for Devices would have a link to [DeviceList::iter()](https://dcuddeback.github.io/libusb-rs/libusb/struct.DeviceList.html#method.iter) and DeviceList would have a link to [Context::devices()](https://dcuddeback.github.io/libusb-rs/libusb/struct.Context.html#method.devices)...\r\n\r\nAnother example: [PortSettings](https://docs.rs/serial-core/0.4.0/serial_core/struct.PortSettings.html) would have a link to [SerialPort::configure()](https://docs.rs/serial-core/0.4.0/serial_core/trait.SerialPort.html#tymethod.configure).\r\n\r\nThis would make it much easier to find out all the necessary info from reading the doc.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44024/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44024/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
