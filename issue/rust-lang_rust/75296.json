This means the hyperlinks only show up if the crate authors know about them and choose to use them. However, there are many more code snippets used in documentation without the explicit `[]` link. If rustdoc tries to render those links, it would have a much wider impact even for users that don't know about intra-doc links.\r\n\r\nSome pages that would be positively affected by this:\r\n- https://docs.rs/serde_json/1.0.57/serde_json/#operating-on-untyped-json-values (`io::Read`, `serde_json::Value`)\r\n- https://docs.rs/postgres/0.17.5/postgres/#implementation (basically everything)\r\n- https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.22/tokio/sync/index.html#oneshot-channel (various)\r\n\r\nI don't suggest that we warn if the links fail to resolve (since people use code blocks for other things like `1 + 2`). This is just a best-effort feature.\r\n\r\ncc @eddyb", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75296/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/75296/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
