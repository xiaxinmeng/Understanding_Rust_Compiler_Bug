For example:\r\n\r\n- [`_mm_loadl_epi64`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/arch/x86/fn._mm_loadl_epi64.html) supposedly performs a 128-bit load (given that we're passing a pointer to `__m128i`. This is not true, however. The load is 64-bit and there are no alignment requirements whatsoever, so passing a `*const c_void` would be probably the better option.\r\n- The same also applies to [`_mm_storel_epi64`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/arch/x86/fn._mm_storel_epi64.html).\r\n- The [`_mm_load_si128`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/arch/x86/fn._mm_load_si128.html) and [`_mm_loadu_si128`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/arch/x86/fn._mm_loadu_si128.html) types require the passing of a pointer to `__m128i`, but I believe requiring a `*const c_void` would be better here.\r\n- The same also applies to [`_mm_store_si128`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/arch/x86/fn._mm_store_si128.html) and [`_mm_storeu_si128`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/arch/x86/fn._mm_storeu_si128.html) (but a `*mut c_void` should be passed here instead).\r\n\r\nThese issues are not Rust-specific; the C intrinsics are also plagued with these issues. Since, however, it's impossible to change the signatures with respect to C (because that would be a breaking change), I believe fixing them on Rust side before they become stable will be worthwhile.\r\n\r\n(FYI: Some of these examples were taken from https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2016/04/03/sse-mind-the-gap/)", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/49688/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/49688/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
