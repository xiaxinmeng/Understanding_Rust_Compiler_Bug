Stable and nightly are both affected.\n\nThe `gl_generator` dependency is only used a build dependency to generate some Rust code that is then `include!`ed in glium. There are only three differences between the Rust code generated by gl_generator 0.0.27 (which overflows) and the code generated by gl_generator 0.0.25 (which works). Two `#[derive(Clone)]` lines added and one `#[allow(raw_pointer_derive)]`. \n\nOne of the two structs newly affected by `#[derive(Clone)]` is huge (around 2000 members). However the struct compiles just fine by itself. It is used as a field in [glium's `Context` struct](https://github.com/tomaka/glium/blob/master/src/context/mod.rs#L43) but `Context` itself doesn't derive `Clone`.\n\nBecause of this diagnostic I fear that this is a \"real\" stack overflow and not just a bug leading to an infinite recursion.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "tomaka", "id": 1412254, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTIyNTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1412254?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka", "html_url": "https://github.com/tomaka", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomaka/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/26467/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/26467/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
