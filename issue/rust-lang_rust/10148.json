My main reaction is: \"The whole pattern `~[b]` does look like a so-called ~-box pattern to me, which seems like it should fit the needs of a `~[int]`.\"\n\nAfter inspecting the source code for `_match.rs`, I _think_ the issue is that I need to explicitly borrow `a` and then match against `&[b]`, like so:\n\n``` rust\nfn f(a: ~[int]) {\n    match &a {\n        &[b] => { let b:int = b; println!(\"a: {:?} b: {:d}\", a, b); }\n        _ => { fail!(); }\n}\n```\n\nthough I do not understand why the above compiles, since I would have thought that borrowing a `~[int]` via `&a` would mean I should use match clauses of the form e.g. `&~[b]`, not `&[b]`.\n\nIn any case, we need a better error message here, preferably one that cross-references further discussion elsewhere, such as an appropriate (hypothetical) section of the rust.md manual.  Note that the current rust.md documentation on `match` does not suffice to explain what to do here.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10148/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10148/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
