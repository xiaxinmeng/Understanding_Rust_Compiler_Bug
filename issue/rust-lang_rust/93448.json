When the docs are expanded/updated as part of the stabilization the *likely* path forward is that they'll describe that a Termination returned from `main` will print any errors and then use `std::process::exit` to end the program.\n\nWhen the Termination docs are expanded, we should be sure to maintain clearly that what the standard library's runtime does is *not* a hard requirement on what other runtimes must do with the Termination data. Particularly, a no_std binary being run on an embedded system does not necessarily have anywhere to print, and it certainly can't call the specific function `std::process::exit`.\n\n* cc @yaahc\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"ZHANGWENTAI\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93448/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93448/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
