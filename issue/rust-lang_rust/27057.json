This requires a custom build, and therefore users need a way to detect whether a given build has that customization.\n\nFor Firefox I wrote a configure feature test. There's a school of autotools coding which asserts this is best because it's more robust to test the actual thing you need (linking rust to C++ targeting 10.6). However it is slow and wordy, and we'd like to be able to just ask rustc how it was built.\n\nTwo ideas:\n- Add a `--print cfg` switch which reports the various #[cfg] values on the command line. Driver scripts could call this and parse the output. This is a general mechanism which might be useful for other features.\n- The `--disable-elf-tls` option could append a build specifier like `+notls` to the semver, and driver scripts could look for that in the output of `rustc --version`. Could be a quick fix.\n\nNB we'd like to remove the need for `--disable-elf-tls` entirely (#26581) at which point we could require a minimum rustc version to assert this, but until that time I think it's helpful to address this.\n\ncc @alexcrichton \n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27057/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27057/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
