The [wiki](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Doc-using-rustdoc) makes some attempt at specifying conventions, but these need to be fleshed out and actually applied to the codebase.\n\nRight now, some doc-comments are written in the third-person indicative:\n\n``` rust\npub fn map<T, U>(opt: &Option<T>, f: fn(x: &T) -> U) -> Option<U> {\n    //! Maps a `some` value by reference from one type to another\n```\n\nand some are written in the imperative:\n\n``` rust\npub fn chain<T, U>(opt: Option<T>,\n                   f: fn(t: T) -> Option<U>) -> Option<U> {\n    /*!\n     * Update an optional value by optionally running its content through a\n     * function that returns an option.\n     */\n```\n\nThese two examples illustrate another inconsistency: Some summaries (the first line of the comment) have no terminal punctuation, while others end with a period.\n\nOne more thing that varies is the comment style itself. Some doc-comments look like\n\n``` rust\n/*!\n * foo...\n * bar...\n * baz...\n */\n```\n\nwhile others look like\n\n``` rust\n/*!\n foo...\n bar...\n baz...\n */\n```\n\nOnce these rules (and others) are codified, I'd be happy to start going through the doc-comments and updating them.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4361/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4361/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
