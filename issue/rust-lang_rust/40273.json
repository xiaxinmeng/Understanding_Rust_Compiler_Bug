Don't get me wrong, is perfectly fine and useful like it is now. But:\r\n\r\n- It would be better to have an \"index of methods\". Just compare [the java ArrayList doc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) to [the Rust Vec doc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html). In the case of the Java doc, an user looking for the method he wants is very fast because all is condensed in a little space. Nevertheless, the Rust Vec webpage is nice, but you have to scroll a lot to find the exact function you are looking for.\r\n\r\nI think there are 2 possible solutions to this:\r\n\r\n1) Condense the docs in a HTML \"list\" and show each method example and comments when you click on it.\r\n\r\n2) Create an index on the top of the page (or another page) with one-line description of what the function does and a link to the details in the same page (down).\r\n\r\nI'm here not just to ask for work. I can help on it if you guide me a little, even being a rust noob.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40273/reactions", "total_count": 10, "+1": 10, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40273/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
