As rustc allows only one source input file and only provides methods to link, not to add objects, there's currently no way to do this without extra work.\r\n\r\nI think this is probably a bug, as almost all other systems programming languages provide simple methods of doing this, and I don't imagine it would be difficult to implement. Perhaps an \"-io myobj.o\" type syntax?", "closed_by": {"login": "jonas-schievink", "id": 1786438, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY0Mzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786438?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonas-schievink", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79821/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79821/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
