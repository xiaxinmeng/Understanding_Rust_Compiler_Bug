First, it would be nice to give a cleaner error message, since this is an expected case. Second and more importantly, the panic halts the `cargo bench` or `cargo test` run without running other executables.\r\n\r\nI've attached an example project showing this. The fake benchmark harness in `benches/example.rs` checks for the argument `--example`. However, the `libtest` harness for the tests in the `src` directory is launched first and panics on seeing the same argument. This means that the naive `cargo bench -- --example` doesn't work as one would expect.\r\n\r\n[command-line-example.zip](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/files/1609277/command-line-example.zip)\r\n\r\nThis is a problem for me because it means I can't add command-line arguments to Criterion.rs benchmarks without an extra hassle for users unless `libtest` also accepts those same arguments.\r\n  ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47241/reactions", "total_count": 14, "+1": 14, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47241/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
