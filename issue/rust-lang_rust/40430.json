My understanding of the problem is that Tokio returns immediately (because some IO blocks), the buffer gets deallocated, but the borrow is still accessible from the closure on the next `poll()`.\r\n\r\nOn most smaller examples I've tried, Rust prevents me from doing this, but the error locations are (rightfully) in the closure.\r\n\r\nMy server then calls `debug!` on that buffer, and prints parts of the buffer, overwritten by subsequent writes.\r\n\r\nIn my case, this could not happen when I started threading the `Request` buffer through the closures, and have my server return `(Request, Response)` (I needed the `Request` anyway), instead of just `Response`.", "closed_by": {"login": "P-E-Meunier", "id": 17021304, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDIxMzA0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17021304?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/P-E-Meunier", "html_url": "https://github.com/P-E-Meunier", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/P-E-Meunier/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/P-E-Meunier/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/P-E-Meunier/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/P-E-Meunier/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/P-E-Meunier/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/P-E-Meunier/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/P-E-Meunier/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/P-E-Meunier/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/P-E-Meunier/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40430/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40430/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
