However, this suffers from two downsides; first, as @nikomatsakis said in his last comment in #8215, it is impossible to use re-exports to control accessibility and visibility of members and methods. Second, \"barrier modules\" doing re-exports requires tedious boilerplate code and reduces \"code locality\" (it is hard to tell where a function is accessible just by looking at it - one needs to also trace the re-exports, which are in other modules).\n\nAdding a module level `friend` keyword would help solving both problems. The idea is that in addition to the existing rules, if a module `foo` says `friend mod bar` then the code in the module `bar` can access any private code of the module `foo`.\n\nThis is different from the C++ `friend` keyword in that it works at the module level, keeping things simple and in line with the general spirit of the current rules.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pnkfelix", "id": 173127, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173127?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix", "html_url": "https://github.com/pnkfelix", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10383/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10383/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
