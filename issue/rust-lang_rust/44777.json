`impl Default for HashMap<K, V, S>` really only needs `S: Default`\r\n  - `impl Debug for HashMap<K, V, S>` really only needs `K: Debug` and `V: Debug`\r\n  - Many of the methods only require one out of `K: Eq + Hash` or `S: BuildHasher`, or sometimes neither.\r\n\r\nMost of this isn't a big deal, but for `Default` and `Debug` this is a nuisance because you can't use `#[derive(Debug, Default)]` on unconstrained types containing `HashMap`, e.g.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// won't compile\r\n#[derive(Debug, Default)]\r\nstruct MyStruct<K>(HashMap<K>);\r\n\r\n// your options are to either:\r\n//\r\n//   - needlessly constrain `K` directly on the struct itself,\r\n//     which then infects everything involving MyStruct\r\n//   - define Debug and Default manually with the redundant constraints;\r\n//     downstream types that contain MyStruct are still screwed\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne might argue that this would limit potential implementations, but for a lot them like `Default` or `.len()`, no sensible implementation should ever use `K: Eq + Hash` at all.\r\n\r\nThis also applies to `BTreeMap` to some extent (`Default` doesn't need `Ord`, for example).\r\n\r\nPatch: https://github.com/Rufflewind/rust/commit/a1587a17b5807b80b48a6f9b12932cd388af7804", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44777/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44777/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
