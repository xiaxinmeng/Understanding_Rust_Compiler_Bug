Instead every public symbol in every crate I used was visible, and no dead code was eliminated, resulting in a very bloated dylib.\n\nI was able to fix this by creating a linker version script with only the intended public symbols in the global section and passing linker arguments:\n-C link-args=\"-Wl,-version-script=version.script -Wl,-gc-sections\"\n\nThis works but it requires extra manual effort maintaining the version script and it is not cross-platform. It would be nice if Rust supported this natively.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mprobinson", "id": 2033019, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzMwMTk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2033019?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mprobinson", "html_url": "https://github.com/mprobinson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mprobinson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mprobinson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mprobinson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mprobinson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mprobinson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mprobinson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mprobinson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mprobinson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mprobinson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18541/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18541/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
