This is not consistent with generalized where clauses. Probably the right approach is to:\n1. Create a `ParameterEnvironment` that contains the bounds from the trait method, substituted appropriately so that they are in the namespace of the impl.\n2. Create a fresh inference and fulfillment context.\n3. Register each bound in the impl method in that fulfillment context and then run `select_all_or_error()`. If any errors result, that indicates a bound in the impl that does not appear in the trait.\n4. We have to remember to also run `resolve_regions_and_report_errors()` as well to check for region obligations that are not satisfiable.\n\nWe may want to take some care here with respect to error messages; we probably want to print something more helpful about how there is a mismatch between the trait and impl.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "flaper87", "id": 13816, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13816?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87", "html_url": "https://github.com/flaper87", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20020/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20020/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
