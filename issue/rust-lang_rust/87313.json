For example, it could convert to:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn f() {\r\n    if !(expr) { ::std::panic::panic_any(123); }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is pretty awful and probably has other downsides.  Trying to format with `{:?}` is also probably not a reliable option, since it would require the payload to impl Debug, and the user's code may be relying on catching the panic and inspecting the payload.\r\n\r\nI don't know what is really practical here.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n`rustc 1.55.0-nightly (014026d1a 2021-07-19)`", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87313/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87313/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
