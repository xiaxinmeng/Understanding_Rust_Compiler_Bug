While this is the easiest solution that will work in the most cases, it's usually rather slow.\r\n\r\nThere is a `rust.use-lld` option in `config.toml` which can significantly speed up incremental builds and should be on by default.\r\n\r\nThis will work fine on Linux and should also work fine on Windows, but LLD on MacOS isn't well maintained and has issues so it should not be used by default. A better option here would be [zld](https://github.com/michaeleisel/zld) (there are two zlds out there, this is the right one). On Linux (and on MacOS once it's released), we may also be able to use `mold`, which is even faster and could make another difference.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103541/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 2}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103541/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
