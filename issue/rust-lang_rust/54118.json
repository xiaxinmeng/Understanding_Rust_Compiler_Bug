[Here's](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libstd/sys/windows/fs.rs#L217) the relevant code in the Windows FS implementation. Based on [this MS doc page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/fileio/file-security-and-access-rights), my guess is that the Rust code is somehow interacting with the Windows `SYNCHRONIZE` flag in a way that's causing problems.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not a native Windows dev so this isn't my area of expertise, and it's a bit tricky for me to investigate this in detail. But I can't find any evidence on the internet that the error above is an expected behavior.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54118/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54118/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
