This includes almost all of the `std::os` module. This is all legacy code at this point and it needs to get all rebuilt on the new runtime's libuv implementation.\n\nMost file operations are exposed through `rt::io::file`, which I think is comprehensive enough, but this may involve adding more uv bindings where necessary.\n\nI'm not tagging this as E-easy because I don't think that it's a straightforward refactoring. This will involve understanding how to migrate functions and being sure to expose errors which occur at the underlying layer.\n\nThis may also be best held off until #6163 is dealt with, but it's going to be painful in either way from what I can tell.\n\nNominating for 1.0, we can never block a thread in a syscall.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10057/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10057/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
