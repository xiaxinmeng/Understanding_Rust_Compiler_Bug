It seems to me that currently the 30 minute intro tries to be both, and TRPL is already a good \"getting started\" guide, so the 30 minute intro should focus on being the overview.\n\nTo this end, the 30 minute intro should open with what is most unique about Rust, namely its ownership system. Many programming languages have tooling similar to Rust's Cargo, and putting Cargo at the top of the guide hides the most unique features below the fold. In my opinion, the tooling is the thing that is least impressive about Rust, and should be at the bottom of the page.\n\nCurrently the Tools section is at the top of the page, probably because if the user wanted to follow along with the 30 minute intro, that is where they would start. I believe the assumption that a user would want to follow along from the beginning to be flawed, however. The 30 minute intro should operate under the assumption that the user has not downloaded Rust and its goal should be to convince the user to do so. Once we have convinced the user, we can point him to TRPL for a \"follow along\" introduction.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22636/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22636/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
