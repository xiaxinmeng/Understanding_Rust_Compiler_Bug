The most common reason I find myself doing this is because I'm trying to learn the interface for some type that I want to use.\n\nComing from an algebraic datatype background, I often want to know the set of ways to introduce a type and the different functions that accept that type (roughly speaking, producers and consumers of a type).\n\nThe rustdocs as they are today do a good job of listing the `impl` functions for a type and enumerating traits for the type. So what more do I want? Let's say there is a module `foo` that defines the type `Foo`. Often times `foo`, and other modules within the same library, also define functions that operate on `Foo`. I would like a convenient way to see these functions together. Perhaps we could call it a type indexed index :)\n\nI apologize if this feature already exists and I've overlooked it.\n\nThanks in advance!\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37061/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37061/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
