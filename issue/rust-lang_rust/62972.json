The short reason why this is needed is because I am [writing a library](https://github.com/openSUSE/libpathrs) that uses `libc::openat` (which needs the actual flag arguments).\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add something like `OpenOptionsExt::mode` and `OpenOptionsExt::flags` to return the internal flag structure so that it can be used outside the stdlib? Otherwise it's simply not possible to have an ergonomic Rust library that uses interfaces other than `OpenOptions::open` which simply isn't sufficient for the security usecases I have.", "closed_by": {"login": "cyphar", "id": 2888411, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODg0MTE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2888411?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cyphar", "html_url": "https://github.com/cyphar", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cyphar/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cyphar/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cyphar/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cyphar/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cyphar/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cyphar/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cyphar/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cyphar/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cyphar/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62972/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62972/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
