disabling of all the deprecated stuff to it as well.\r\n\r\nThe amount of additional required changes will be negligible compared to changes already required for 2018 migration, especially if we are counting \"2018 idioms\" in.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, hardcoded warnings are bad, mkay, and audit is also necessary to turn them into configurable lints or errors. (Most of the warnings are very old and predate the deprecation lint system, and fire only in very rare cases.)\r\n\r\nHow to: add some kind of flag to `span_warn` and deprecation lint machinery that's false by default and \"false\" means it's a hard error on 2018 edition. Explicit opt-out can be applied so that a lint/warning continues being a lint/warning even on 2018 edition.\r\n\r\nKnown lints/warnings requiring opt-out:\r\n- Lint `private_in_public`, going to be removed when https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48054 is implemented\r\n- Hardcoded warning https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/942b384d61590c39eb635596de0370a823001817/src/libsyntax/parse/parser.rs#L2004-L2005, going to be removed when rustfmt is stable and packaged with rustc.\r\n- Maybe more... waiting on audit.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52593/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52593/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
