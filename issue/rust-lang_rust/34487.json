I do not know if its inherent functionality was removed or is just hidden... (it always struck me as a bit silly anyhow).\n\n``` rust\n// <'a: 'b, 'b> reads as lifetime 'a is at least as long as 'b.\n// Here, we take in an &'a i32 and return a &'b i32 as a result of coercion.\nfn choose_first<'a: 'b, 'b>(first: &'a i32, _: &'b i32) -> &'b i32\n{\n    first\n}\n\nfn main()\n{\n    let first = 2; // Longer lifetime\n    {\n        let second = 3; // Shorter lifetime\n        println!(\"{} is the first\", choose_first(&second, &first));\n    }\n    println!(\"{}\",first);\n}\n```\n\nBasically, what I read it as is that there would be an error message reporting that the lifetime of b was longer than a, thus invalidating the function signature.  However, no such error occurred despite the lifetime of 'first' being longer than that of 'second'.  Is this a misread or bad wording of the tutorial?\n\nP.S. If this is no longer valid syntax or a feature discarded, please feel free to close the issue.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34487/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34487/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
