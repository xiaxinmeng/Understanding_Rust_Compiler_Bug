Each of them has its use (that\u2019s why they exist), so it will probably be common to have more than one of them installed at the same time on the same machine (such as a developer\u2019s laptop).\n\nCurrently, this it is possible to install multiple rusts at different locations, and set up the `PATH` and (since the [rpath removal]) `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables to pick one of them. However this is error-prone and not very convenient.\n\nIt would be better if multiple versions could be installed in the same \"prefix\" (e.g. `/usr`, where the default environment variables Just Work<sup>\u00ae</sup>). Executables could have a suffix to distinguish them, for example `/usr/bin/rustc` (stable), `/usr/bin/rustc-beta` and `/usr/bin/rustc-nightly`. Other files would have to be namespaced somehow to avoid conflicts.\n\n(Corresponding Cargo issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/967)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19263/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19263/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
