My primary motivation is to try to group all the related issues together so they're easier to keep track of. If we can split them into sub-groups, all the better.\r\n\r\nMany of the issues in this list are cribbed from #92449, thanks to @compiler-errors for coming up with that list.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110338/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110338/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
