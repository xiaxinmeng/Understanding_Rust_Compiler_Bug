I would expect this to produce a build warning about using an unstable cfg gate, and produce no build error on all channels.\r\n\r\n(`target_feature=\"mmx\"` is currently gated behind `mmx_target_feature` as far as I can tell) https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/7bdb5dee7bac15458b10b148e9e24968e633053e/compiler/rustc_codegen_llvm/src/llvm_util.rs#L206\r\n\r\nInstead, this happened:\r\n\r\nOn stable, the gate was ignored as expected, but on the nightly channel the cfg check passed, causing the `compile_fail!` to be included in the source. The lack of a feature gate enabling `mmx_target_feature` was ignored, only considering the current release channel.\r\n\r\nI believe this is occurring due to the feature gate logic for the `target_feature` config flag not being checked within the compiler. This mismatch lead me to believe that an unstable `target_feature` flag was actually stable, and write code using it, before realizing it won't function outside of the nightly channel.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n<!--\r\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\r\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\nstable:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.46.0 (04488afe3 2020-08-24)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 04488afe34512aa4c33566eb16d8c912a3ae04f9\r\ncommit-date: 2020-08-24\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.46.0\r\nLLVM version: 10.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nnightly:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.47.0-nightly (bf4342114 2020-08-25)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: bf4342114e357f2934d59e12e31e94532ddb2adf\r\ncommit-date: 2020-08-25\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.47.0-nightly\r\nLLVM version: 11.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n(this also occurs on rust-playpen at time of filing: https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=4c58960ac6fc536a2da930d6c0b3d8e9)\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76842/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76842/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
