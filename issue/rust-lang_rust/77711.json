Their workflow up until now has been\r\n```\r\nx.py test --stage 0 library/std\r\n```\r\nThis is correct: it builds the standard library once and the compiler zero times. Any changes they make will be reflected in the tests.\r\nNow assume for some reason they have to run a UI test; maybe they change a `rustc_on_unimplemented` diagnostic so the .stderr files need to change. They've been using --stage 0 so far, and they _really_ don't want to build the compiler, so they try the same thing on the new test suite:\r\n```\r\nx.py test --stage 0 src/test/ui\r\n```\r\nThis is incorrect: it builds neither the standard library nor the compiler and runs tests on beta instead.\r\nUnfortunately, the errors this gives are incomprehensible: they say things like\r\n```\r\n-    LL | impl<T: Copy> Foo<T> {\r\n-       |       ^^^^^^\r\n+    LL | impl<T: std::marker::Copy> Foo<T> {\r\n+       |       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\nwhich give absolutely no indication that you're running the wrong version of the compiler (maybe you'd even think it's caused by your change!)\r\n\r\nInstead, x.py should give an error like this:\r\n```\r\n$ x.py test --stage 0 src/test/ui\r\nerror: `--stage 0` is not meaningful for compiletest test suites\r\nhelp: use `--stage 1` instead\r\nnote: if you're sure you want to do this, please open an issue as to why. In the meantime, you can override this with `COMPILETEST_FORCE_STAGE_0=1`.\r\n```", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77711/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77711/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
