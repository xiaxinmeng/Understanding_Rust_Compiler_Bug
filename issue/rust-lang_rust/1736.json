So if you have `map<T, U>` and you call it on `<int, int>`, the compiler can compile a version specifically for those types, and if you then call it on `<@int, (float, float)>`, it can generate another version.\n\nWe can reuse generated functions for similar types. For example, since generics can't look 'into' types, types like `int` and `uint` could be passed to the same version of a function without problems. We also store tydescs in boxes now, so a single version could be used for all `@` types, and simply look inside the box if it needs to call free or compare glue on them.\n\nThis is related to the project of cross-crate inlining. To monomorphize a function, you also need some representation of its code.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "marijnh", "id": 144427, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144427?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh", "html_url": "https://github.com/marijnh", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1736/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1736/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
