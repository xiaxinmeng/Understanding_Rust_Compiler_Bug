Make sure to include the relevant\r\nRFC for the feature if it has one. Otherwise provide a short summary of the\r\nfeature and link any relevant PRs or issues, and remove any sections that are\r\nnot relevant to the feature.\r\n\r\nRemember to add team labels to the tracking issue.\r\nFor a language team feature, this would e.g., be `T-lang`.\r\nSuch a feature should also be labeled with e.g., `F-my_feature`.\r\nThis label is used to associate issues (e.g., bugs and design questions) to the feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe feature gate for the issue is `#![feature(task_yield_now)]`.\r\n\r\n### About tracking issues\r\n\r\nTracking issues are used to record the overall progress of implementation.\r\nThey are also uses as hubs connecting to other relevant issues, e.g., bugs or open design questions.\r\nA tracking issue is however *not* meant for large scale discussion, questions, or bug reports about a feature.\r\nInstead, open a dedicated issue for the specific matter and add the relevant feature gate label.\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n<!--\r\nInclude each step required to complete the feature. Typically this is a PR\r\nimplementing a feature, followed by a PR that stabilises the feature. However\r\nfor larger features an implementation could be broken up into multiple PRs.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][doc-guide])\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][stabilization-guide])\r\n\r\n[stabilization-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr\r\n[doc-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#documentation-prs\r\n\r\n### Implementation history\r\n\r\n- Initial implementation https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74335\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a list of all the PRs that were involved in implementing the feature.\r\n-->\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "yoshuawuyts", "id": 2467194, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjcxOTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2467194?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts", "html_url": "https://github.com/yoshuawuyts", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74331/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74331/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
