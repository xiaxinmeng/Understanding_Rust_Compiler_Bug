One of the restrictions impls of this trait have is that the type has `Eq, PartialEq` recursively derived. This is also something that pattern matching is interested so we should find some way of sharing the impl between `ConstParamTy` and the trait used for allowing constants to be used as patterns.\r\n\r\nThe current `ConstParamTy` trait should be split out into `trait ConstParamTy: StructuralMatch` and `trait StructuralMatch: PartialEq + StructuralPartialEq` with `StructuralMatch` also having a builtin check that all its fields are `StructuralMatch`.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that the requirements for const parameter types may end up being stricter than the requirements to use a constant as a pattern so we should have two separate traits rather than renaming `ConstParamTy` to something that makes sense in the context of pattern matching.\r\n\r\ncc @oli-obk ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/112221/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/112221/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
