Adding support for this would make it much simpler to call a C function and provide an appropriate callback inline.\r\n\r\n\r\n(I'm also curious what it would take to make a *capturing* closure work as an extern function pointer, but that's a separate issue.)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44291/reactions", "total_count": 11, "+1": 11, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44291/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
