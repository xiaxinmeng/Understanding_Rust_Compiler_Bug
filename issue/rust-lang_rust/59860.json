A review of rustdoc for accessibility, especially for dyslexia and attention disorders, finds that there are a number of visually distracting elements in rustdoc which can draw attention away from the main content. This should be considered along with the other issues mentioned in #59829 about the overall effect of a number of distracting elements on the page.\r\n\r\nThere are several heavyweight UI elements.\r\n\r\n* The headings for the item in question, and the parent item, are enclosed in a black-bordered, white background box, contrasting with the background\r\n* The crate name is bold in the parent item box\r\n* There are high contrast horizontal rules on both sides delimiting the headings in the current page\r\n* There are large, bold headings, with a lot of whitespace and low-contrast horizontal rules below in the parent item section\r\n* Headings are centered, while items are left justified\r\n\r\nIn addition, the two sections have quite inconsistent styling.\r\n\r\n* Headings in the top section are same size as individual items, but centered and delimited by heavy horizontal rules\r\n* Headings in the bottom section are a large, bold font, with a lot of space and very light horizontal rules\r\n\r\n<img width=\"200\" alt=\"Screenshot of current item section of sidebar\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37398/55911876-8c22b500-5baf-11e9-8ef1-8ca156cfde3f.png\"><img width=\"201\" alt=\"Screenshot of parent item section of sidebar\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37398/55911418-9ee8ba00-5bae-11e9-8392-a286751d87a0.png\">\r\n\r\nWe can compare that with the sidebar in mdBook; while they serve different purposes, it is useful to look at them together.\r\n\r\nmdBook simply uses an outline view for nesting, without larger or bolder headings. It does have bold chapter/section numbers, which is slightly attention grabbing, but otherwise is both a simpler style and fits more content into the sidebar with less decoration.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"303\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-04-10 at 4 42 17 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37398/55911985-bc6a5380-5baf-11e9-8e67-e26c79cb2efd.png\">\r\n\r\nSpecific recommendations:\r\n\r\n* [x] Drop the black bordered white boxes in the sidebar\r\n* [x] Drop the black horizontal rules in the sidebar\r\n* [x] Use at most two attributes to distinguish levels of headings and individual items. Those could include:\r\n  - Indentation, as in an outline view like mdBook\r\n  - Font size\r\n  - Font boldness\r\n  - Extra whitespace\r\n  - Single light horizontal rule\r\n* [x] Prefer left-aligned text to centered", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/59860/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/59860/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
