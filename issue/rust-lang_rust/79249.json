Currently I think the best option is to using `missing-tools = true` and check the output for warnings about skipped tools in the dist step. This is a bit fragile though, so it would be nice if this was built in.\r\n\r\n@Mark-Simulacrum mentionned this would also be desirable for `miri` on stable/beta?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79249/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79249/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
