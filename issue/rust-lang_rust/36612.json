While one of\nthe LLD devs was looking over one of the object files that was used one of the bug reports, they\nfound out something that seemed irregular:\n\nQuoting @rui314's [comment](https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=30435#c1) from the LLVM bug tracker:\n\n> I sent out https://reviews.llvm.org/D24789 to fix the issue.\n> But I'm not completely sure if the object file created by rustc is valid. At least it seems to be causing a unnecessary trouble by choosing an irregular value for sh_entsize.\n> hello.o's .debug_gdb_scripts is a mergeable section with sh_entsize = 0. Usually the field is 1 for a section containing mergeable strings.\n> Jorge, I think you want to change rustc so that it sets 1 instead of 0. \n\nThe object mentioned in the comment can be generated with:\n\n```\n$ rustup default nightly-2016-09-15\n\n$ echo 'fn main() { println!(\"Hello, world!\"); }' > hello.rs\n\n$ rustc -g hello.rs\n```\n\nThis issue is to discuss if we should change the value of sh_entsize for this particular section.\n\nThis is above my paygrade so I'm going to cc @michaelwoerister who knows our debuginfo very well.\n\nP.S. This particular bug has already been fixed in lld by, AIUI, relaxing one of their checks so our\nobject files are accepted.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "wesleywiser", "id": 831192, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjgzMTE5Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/831192?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser", "html_url": "https://github.com/wesleywiser", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36612/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36612/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
