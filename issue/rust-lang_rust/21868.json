Graphviz should also have the ability to read a dot file into memory, preserving the attributes of nodes and edges. This is probably one among many features that could be added to GraphWalk, but it would be immediately useful for parsing and manipulating dot files (a task I'm attempting right now).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "kmcallister", "id": 444997, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDk5Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/444997?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister", "html_url": "https://github.com/kmcallister", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21868/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21868/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
