We also should have a num_fields, as even in that schema, you can't tell the difference between\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nenum Foo {\r\n  A(#[doc(hidden)] i32),\r\n  B(#[doc(hidden)]i32, #[doc(hidden)]i32)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis also effects struct AFAIKT.\r\n\r\nI don't think this needs to be done now. I'll file an issue for it.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @aDotInTheVoid in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/100582#issuecomment-1215087326_\r\n\r\n@rustbot modify labels: +A-rustdoc-json +T-rustdoc", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100587/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100587/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
