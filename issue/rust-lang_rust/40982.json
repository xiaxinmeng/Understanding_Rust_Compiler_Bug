I was working on implementing mathematical operations in my language, but the entirely wrong branch of an if statement is being executed, including when the condition is true.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of moving parts in the interpreter so I couldn't get it trimmed down, but the [full repository lives on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/cheezgi/juggle/tree/master/src). The if statement in question is in [this match arm](https://gitlab.com/cheezgi/juggle/blob/master/src/main.rs#L122).\r\n\r\nI have a call to `unreachable!()` in the else body, which is getting triggered.\r\n\r\n**I expected this to happen:** Well, I think we can all see what the problem here is. The body of the if, rather than the else, should have been executed.\r\n\r\n**Instead, this happened:** The body of the else was executed rather than the body of the if.\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`\r\n\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.17.0-nightly (ccce2c6eb 2017-03-27)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: ccce2c6eb914a66571f60fa0afe8a46faa9fb3bd\r\ncommit-date: 2017-03-27\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.17.0-nightly\r\nLLVM version: 3.9\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis bug affects stable, beta, and nightly.
