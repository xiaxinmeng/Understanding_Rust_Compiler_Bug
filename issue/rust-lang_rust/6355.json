The offending line is:\n\n```\n        let next = str::char_range_at(*rdr.src, current_byte_offset);\n```\n\nWith `rdr` being of type `&mut StringReader` and `rdr.src` being `@~str`. `str::char_range_at` expects a `&str` as its first argument.\n\nWhat happens now is that the compiler generates code that copies the whole `src` string, which is obviously bad.\n\nThe copy is triggered by the `rdr` being mutable. Without the `mut`, the compiler doesn't generate a copy. A benchmark to demonstrate that behaviour can be found here: https://gist.github.com/dotdash/5546866\n\n@nikomatsakis said he wants to look into this.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6355/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6355/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
