What I originally intended was something like \"people building from source once and installing it locally\", like Gentoo users or something. I think \"dist\" is a much better name for this profile: it makes it more clear why CI uses the profile and it hopefully will make it easier for distros to find and understand.\n\ncc @cuviper - you said in https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/233931-t-compiler.2Fmajor-changes/topic/Redesign.20bootstrap.20stages.20compiler-team.23619/near/351408631 this would be helpful, do you still think that? The only other name I can think of is something like `install` but I'm not sure that's a good description of what CI is doing with the profile.\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"AnakinSkywalkeer\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/112074/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/112074/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "reopened"}
