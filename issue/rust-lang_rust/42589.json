For example, in [`core::ops::Deref`][deref] documentation, there is a link to the '`Deref` coercions' page of the first edition, with older URL structure.\r\n\r\n[deref]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ops/trait.Deref.html\r\n\r\nThis makes kind of \"broken link\" in the documentation, though it's not a real broken link, because the pages under the older URL suggest that we try with the namespace added. However, it does add additional link that visitors should follow, which probably isn't what they want.\r\n\r\nI think the solution is simple; adding `first-edition` namespace if the link pointing to the Book does not have any namespace.
