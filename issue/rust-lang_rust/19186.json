This list serves two purposes:\n- It should signal which parts of the standard library become actionable. For example, after #19126 gets fixed, the `Option`/`Result` API can be updated to use unboxed closures.\n- As a list of high priority FIXMEs.\n# Unboxed closures\n\n-> Move library code away from boxed closures (part of #14798)\n## In function arguments\n\n`Option`, `Result`, etc\n\n``` rust\n// from\nfn map<U>(self,  f: |T| -> U) -> Option<U>;\n// to\nfn map<U, F: FnOnce(T) -> U>(self,  f: F) -> Option<U>;\n```\n### Blockers\n- [x] the trait `Fn<(&_,), &_>` is not implemented for the type `fn(&'a u8) -> &'a u8` #19126 (AFAIK, this will be a compiler change, and will need a snapshot)\n## In structs fields\n\n`core::iter::Map`\n\n``` rust\nstruct Map<A, B, I, F> where I: Iterator<A>, F: FnMut(A) -> B {\n    iter: I,\n    f: F,\n}\n```\n\nMain issue here is that closures have anonymous types, so they can't be part of the signature of functions, structs, etc. See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/19186#issuecomment-64425312\nand/or https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18101#issuecomment-61416554 for more details.\n### Use bare functions instead of closures that capture nothing\n\n`core::str::Bytes`, `core::str::AnyLines`\n`collections::btree::Keys`, `collections::hash_map::Values`\n\nAs pointed by @sfackler: If the closure captures nothing, we can use a bare function instead.\n\n``` rust\ntype Bytes<'a> = Map<&'a u8, u8, slice::Items<'a, u8>, fn(&u8) -> u8>;\n\n// Self = str\nfn bytes(&self) -> Bytes {\n    fn deref(&b: &u8) -> u8 { b }\n    self.as_bytes().iter().map(deref)\n}\n```\n#### Blockers\n- the trait `Fn<(&_,), &_>` is not implemented for the type `fn(&'a u8) -> &'a u8` #19126\n### Use boxed closures otherwise\n\n_Add examples here_\n#### Blockers\n- [x]  `Box<Fn(int) -> int + 'static>` is not accepted: \"explicit lifetime bound required\" #18772 (Fixed in #19298, but needs to get snaptshot-ed)\n# Associated types\n\n-> Update library code for associated output types #17826\n\nThere are several issues in this area, so I'll list the blockers in increasing complexity order:\n## Extension traits with only output types\n\n`AdditiveIterator`, `MultiplicativeIterator`, etc\n### Blockers\n- [ ] ICE: When cross-crate importing trait with associated output types https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18048#issuecomment-63867112 (this one blocks any work with associated types)\n- [x]  rustdoc panics when dealing with associated types #18594 (this one also blocks any work with associated types)\n- [x]  Associated types Order can cause ICE #18611 (can be worked around by shuffling the code around, but fixing it should reduce the amount of code churn)\n## Traits with only output types that are used for GP\n\n`AsSlice`, `Hasher`, etc\n### Blockers\n- [x]  ICE: When using an associated type as the type parameter of a bound #19081\n- [x]  Support the `Trait<Output=Type>` syntax #18432 \n## Traits with input and output types\n\n`Add`, `Mul`,  `Sub`, etc\n### Blockers\n- [x] ICE: When implementing trait with a generic parameter and an associated output type #19129 \n\n---\n\nIt's likely that we'll find more blockers as we progress, so I'll try to keep this list up to date.\n\ncc @alexcrichton @aturon @nick29581 @nikomatsakis\n", "closed_by": {"login": "japaric", "id": 5018213, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTgyMTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5018213?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric", "html_url": "https://github.com/japaric", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19186/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19186/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
