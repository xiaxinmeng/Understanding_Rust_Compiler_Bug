This means that Rng in question will start generating the same sequence values when [generator is passed by value](https://gist.github.com/nagisa/0490886497c15a0eeaef).\n\nThese generators should not implement Copy (implicit) and implement Clone (explicit) instead in case copying generators is intended (which is almost never a case), like `XorShiftRng` does.
