The reasons are discussed on the updated [manpage](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/readdir_r.3.html).\n\nIt states that `readdir` is already thread-safe in \"modern\" implementations, including glibc.  We should see if all platforms targeted by `unix/fs.rs` satisfy this.  Note that the Solaris (Illumos) port is already using plain `readdir`.\n\nIt requires external synchronization if a particular directory stream may be shared among threads, but I believe we avoid that naturally from the lack of `&mut` aliasing.  `Dir` is `Sync`,  but only `ReadDir` accesses it, and only from its mutable `Iterator` implementation.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34668/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34668/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
