It is still under discussion.**\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nRight now in the standard library documentation, when a piece of inline code has part of it linked, the code is split into multiple `<code>` blocks, which renders poorly. For example the [`Arc` thread safety section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/sync/struct.Arc.html#thread-safety) contains\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18604588/114037935-b6340e00-9881-11eb-9739-0b5b62b03158.png)\r\n\r\nHere, between `Arc<` and `RefCell`, and between `<T>` and `>`, there is extra spacing. This is because the doc comment contains\r\n```rust\r\n/// `Arc<`[`RefCell<T>`]`>`\r\n```\r\nwhich is rendered using three `<code>` blocks as\r\n```html\r\n<code>Arc&lt;</code><a href=\"../../std/cell/struct.RefCell.html\"><code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code></a><code>&gt;</code>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think better would be\r\n```rust\r\n/// <code>Arc&lt;[RefCell&lt;T&gt;][RefCell]&gt;</code>\r\n```\r\nwhich presumably is rendered in one block as\r\n```html\r\n<code>Arc&lt;<a href=\"../../std/cell/struct.RefCell.html\">RefCell&lt;T&gt;</a>&gt;</code>\r\n```\r\n(I'm not sure if the link to `RefCell` gets a `title` attribute as well).\r\n\r\nThe downside is that now the doc comment markdown is a bit hairy with explicit `<code>`, `&lt;` and `&gt;` spread throughout.\r\n\r\nIs this substitution considered an improvement? If so I can grep through the code, make some substitutions, and open a PR.\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution would be to change rustdoc itself to combine consecutive code blocks, some of which could be wrapped inside `<a>`/`</a>`, into a single block, though I do not have the know-how to open such a PR. I don't even know if there is some downside to this that I am missing, where `<code>` blocks are meant to be separate, maybe for some markdown compliance or something.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/83997/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/83997/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
