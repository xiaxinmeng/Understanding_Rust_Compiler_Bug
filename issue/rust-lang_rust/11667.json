However, when using the `-c` or `--emit-llvm` flags, along with `--out-dir`, the generated info doesn't have the correct names for the output files. When `-c` is used to compile `foo.rs`, it's output as `foo.o`, and when `--emit-llvm` is used, as `foo.bc`. On both cases the dependency info lists the full library name as it would've been output if none of the option were given. For example:\n\n```\nrustc --emit-llvm --staticlib --out-dir obj/ -L obj/ --dep-info obj/main.d src/main.rs\n```\n\nOutputs `obj/main.bc`, but `obj/main.d` has the following contents:\n\n```\nobj/libmain-66af34bf-0.0.a: src/main.rs src/efi.rs\n```\n\nThe dependency info should be change to reflect the name of the files actually being output by the compiler for the given command.\n\n**EDIT:** Realized it also doesn't track any external modules used by the crate as dependencies. (In this case `libcore-2e829c2f-0.0.rlib` and `libextensions-d5bbcef2-0.0.so`.) This might be on purpose, but doesn't seem ideal to me.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11667/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11667/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
