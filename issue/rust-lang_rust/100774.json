objects, each created by rust using a `cdylib` crate, and they are both invoked from an external (non-rust) executable, it's unusual that both of these libraries will implement and export a `rust_eh_personality` symbol.\r\n\r\nIf, for whatever reason, the external executable tries to invoke `rust_eh_personality`, which library's function call will be invoked?\r\n\r\nIf the two dylibs are built by different versions of rust, or with different options, presumably the `rust_eh_personality` function will differ.\r\n\r\n(even worse would be if any internal code in either shared object invoked `rust_eh_personality` by the process's symbol table, but i'm assuming that internal code references its own `rust_eh_personality` internally)\r\n\r\nUnless there is a clear reason to export the `rust_eh_personality` symbol, it ought to be non-exported by default so that multiple `cdylib` objects can be loaded without colliding symbols.\r\n\r\nI note #92102 raises the same concern, but it seems to be resolved without having stopped exporting `rust_eh_personality`.\r\n\r\nhttps://users.rust-lang.org/t/hiding-rust-eh-personality-symbol-in-cdylib/60490 also discusses the matter, but i don't see how it is resolved in the general case.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100774/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,
