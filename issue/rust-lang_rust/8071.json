Sometimes it seems to be regarded as partial ordering. (cf. @cmr's comment at #7765.)\n\nHowever, some sort algorithms assume that `x ~ z` if `x ~ y` and `y ~ z`. (`a ~ b` here means `!(a < b) && !(a > b)`. this relation is called equivalent or incomparable.) Without the assumption, in worst case O(N^2) comparison is needed to sort N elements. Strict partial ordering with this assumption is called strict weak ordering.\n\nI think it is necessary to clarify what we require to impls for `Ord`: partial ordering (probably minimum requirement), weak ordering, or something else.\n\nSee also: #8360\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8071/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8071/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
