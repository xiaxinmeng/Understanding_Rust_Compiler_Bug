method, or enum variant is not found, similar-named items will be shown as hints. However, when a type, module, or macro is misspelled, the same kind of hints are not shown. I particularly think mistakes involving capitalisation should be considered. This issue came about with a friend I was introducing to rust, and I was hoping the compiler would suggest correcting `string` to `String`.\n\n<!--\nIf dramatically different output is caused by small changes, consider also\nadding them here.\n\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions.
