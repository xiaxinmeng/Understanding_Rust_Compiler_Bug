Note that you'll need to explicitly specify Release, because I can't link to Release code for some reason.\r\n\r\nNote this bit here:\r\n>\tmovl $400, %edx\r\n>\tmovq %rbx, %rsi\r\n>\tcallq memcpy@PLT\r\n\r\nThat looks like a very unnecessary and large copy.\r\n\r\nI ran into this working on rust-selectors for stylo. In the parser, we have a very large stack-allocated SmallVec, under the assumption that it is never moved. I added some inline functions that take the buffer as |self|, and parsing got several percent slower. I rewrote the code to pass things as &mut, and the overhead went away.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, doing:\r\n\r\nfor x in some_small_vec.into_iter() {\r\n...\r\n}\r\n\r\nDoesn't have any memcpy in the disassembly, despite the fact that into_iter() takes self. Presumably some iterator optimization going on.\r\n\r\nCC @SimonSapin @mbrubeck @Manishearth @Gankro @jonathandturner ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42763/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42763/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
