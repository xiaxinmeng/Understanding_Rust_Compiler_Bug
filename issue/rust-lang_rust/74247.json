This is the only target which sets the family without the os. This can make it a little confusing/awkward when writing `cfg` expressions to properly cover targets such as these (sometimes the check for os=\"none\" needs to appear before the family).\r\n\r\nIn practice today this isn't an issue because libcore, liballoc, and compiler_builtins do not ever check the family. AFAIK, the family doesn't have any other effects other than the `cfg` settings.\r\n\r\nThis issue came up during #74033 where I was adjusting some `cfg` expressions for building std for Cargo. I do not know if Cargo's build-std will ever support `x86_64-linux-kernel`, but I'd like to try to cover as many targets as possible and avoid special cases if they are not necessary.\r\n\r\n@eddyb had some [suggestions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74033#discussion_r453144971) which I'll copy here:\r\n\r\n> Does the Linux kernel even have an UNIX API inside of itself? That doesn't sound right but maybe I just haven't seen it before.\r\n> \r\n> (To be clear, I'm thinking that family=\"unix\" is as valid for inside an OS kernel as os=\"thatosname\" - if os=\"none\" is used then surely there should also not be a family? Maybe we should enforce that the family is derived from the OS name and therefore means \"OS family\")\r\n\r\ncc @joshtriplett who I think might know a little about the `x86_64-linux-kernel` target, and @alex who introduced the target.  Perhaps they can shed some light why \"unix\" was chosen.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74247/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74247/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
