Ideally, the assembly would have only one (V)PCMPESTRM instruction.\r\n\r\nThe situation is the same for the following combinations:\r\n\r\n * \\_mm_cmpestrc() followed by an \\_mm_cmpestri() generates two (V)PCMPESTRI instructions\r\n * \\_mm_cmpistrc() followed by an \\_mm_cmpistrm() generates a (V)PCMPISTRI instruction and a (V)PCMPISTRM instruction\r\n * \\_mm_cmpistrc() followed by an \\_mm_cmpistri() generates two (V)PCMPISTRI instructions\r\n\r\nOver at shepmaster/jetscii#24, I prepared a Rust test case and a functionally equivalent C++ test case: https://github.com/shepmaster/jetscii/pull/24#issuecomment-411861393\r\n\r\nI found that GCC 8.2.0 is able to coalesce the (V)PCMPxSTRx instructions. However, LLVM 6.0.1 is not. This appears to be a known issue in LLVM: https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37246\r\n\r\nThis issue particularly impacts efficient use of the \"mask\" variants (explicit and implicit length); the \"index\" variants can simply check whether the index is 16, which indicates no match.\r\n\r\nI am posting this issue here so that people can more easily find this information, but I am not sure what stdsimd can do. Perhaps, though, one possibility is to provide \"mask\" variant combination intrinsics, say cmpestrm() and cmpistrm(), which return the CFlag *and* mask XMM register.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53232/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53232/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
