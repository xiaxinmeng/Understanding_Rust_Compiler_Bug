That will make sure the test actually does something and hasn't *always* passed.\r\n\r\nIt will be too expensive to run all those versions on each bors run, so we could instead only run it every 6 weeks before a release (perhaps we can fold this into crater how? at least the automation if not the same codebase.)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/104939/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/104939/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
