In that\r\ncase, you can use use `issue = \"none\"` in your initial implementation PR. The\r\nreviewer will ask you to open a tracking issue if they agree your feature can be\r\nadded without an RFC.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFeature gate: `#![feature(box_into_inner)]`\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for consuming a `Box` and returning its wrapped value.\r\n\r\nThe language actually supports `*x` as a special case. However it can't be generalized to other types easily. It also doesn't consume the `Box` value immediately if `T` is `Copy`, which is quite a footgun.\r\n\r\nAn explicit version is added here to make the API more consistent with `Pin`, `Cell`, `RefCell` etc.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a short description of the feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor most library features, it'd be useful to include a summarized version of the public API.\r\n(E.g. just the public function signatures without their doc comments or implementation.)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl<T, A: Allocator> Box<T, A> {\r\n     pub fn into_inner(boxed: Self) -> T;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn the simplest case, this is a PR implementing the feature followed by a PR\r\nthat stabilises the feature. However it's not uncommon for the feature to be\r\nchanged before stabilization. For larger features, the implementation could be\r\nsplit up in multiple steps.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation: #80438\r\n- [ ] Final commenting period (FCP)\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- None yet.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80437/reactions", "total_count": 44, "+1": 44, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80437/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
