I chose `E0313` and for my erroneous code example, I used the example from #42574. I quickly realized, through running the example and other code that would also raise `E0313` and through the CI failure message, that `E0313` was not being raised. I went back to consult the issue I received the original code example from and noticed comments about `E0313` not occurring anymore with `NLL`. The issue was eventually labeled with `NLL-fixed-by-NLL`. But, looking at the current contents of the `note.rs` file, `E0313` can still be emitted even while it isn't:\n\n```rs\ninfer::ReborrowUpvar(span, ref upvar_id) => {\n    let var_name = self.tcx.hir().name(upvar_id.var_path.hir_id);\n    let mut err = struct_span_err!(\n        self.tcx.sess,\n        span,\n        E0313,\n        \"lifetime of borrowed pointer outlives lifetime of captured variable `\u200b{}`\u200b...\",\n        var_name\n    );\n```\n\n`E0313` also doesn't have any UI tests as it is part of the error codes in `EXEMPTED_FROM_TEST`.\n\n# Reasoning\nSince `E0313`, is no longer actually emitted (although it is in code that it could) thanks to `NLL`, I believe it should be deprecated.\n\n I would be happy to help deprecate the error code, if it is decided that it should happen. I would just need to know the proper steps to take to deprecate an error code. If there are reasons for why it is still an error code, I would love to be enlightened.\n\n@rustbot claim\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"akabinds\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103742/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103742/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
