This makes it really easy to see what the latest downloads are and find things.\r\n\r\nIn the [top-level of the Node.js `dist`](https://nodejs.org/dist/) page there is also an [`index.json`](https://nodejs.org/dist/index.json) and an [`index.tab`](https://nodejs.org/dist/index.tab), the former easiest for Node.js tooling, the latter easiest for shell scripts. I seem to recall from when I starred this issue and was looking at this that there's a `toml` file with the relevant info in `rustup/dist`, but I don't remember exactly, and can't easily browse to check.\r\n\r\nI was trying to work out what files were available at what URLs, and ended up having to look at the rustup source to find out. Docs would be nice, but browsable directories would be even nicer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> Our dist trees are s3 buckets which don't produce indices by default I believe. However it'd be part of the rust build process which would have to generate those indices since rustup only consumes that content and isn't in charge of it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFrom a quick search online ([Amazon docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/IndexDocumentSupport.html), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27899/is-there-a-way-to-have-index-html-functionality-with-content-hosted-on-s3)), it seems like S3 now supports Index Documents, so this should be relatively straightforward to configure.", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66474/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66474/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
