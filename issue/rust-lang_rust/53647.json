Unfortunately, `proc_macro` keeps private a bunch of functions that would be necessary to use it outside of the context of a macro. It is as simple as creating a `Span`, but also more complex as keeping track and managing source files.\r\n\r\nCompiler developers have only few alternatives:\r\n\r\n* Relying on library such as `syntex` that makes these modules and functions public (but it is not maintained anymore...).\r\n* Build an in-house error reporting system (what a waste of time).\r\n* Design the language as an EDSL in Rust to be able to use `proc_macro` (what if the host language is not Rust).\r\n\r\nA solution might be to provide factory functions guarded behind an option, so the user needs to opt-in, as it would clearly not be the mainstream usage.\r\n\r\nLong-term arguments in favor to make more `proc_macro` functions public:\r\n* A first step towards a real toolbox for compiler programmers who wants to use Rust for prototyping. This is extremely common in research for example. Besides, researchers who would use Rust could also teach it.\r\n* Obtaining a first-rate compiler with good error messages without spending too much time on the infrastructure.\r\n\r\nExamples: two of my projects [bonsai](https://github.com/ptal/bonsai) and [oak](https://github.com/ptal/oak) rely on `syntex` for error reporting, and thus cannot be compiled on Rust stable.", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53647/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53647/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
