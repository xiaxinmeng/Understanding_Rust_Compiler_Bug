For instance, this is in [tonic 0.4.3](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/issues/672)\n\nFixing this would likely be a harsh breaking change (as I mentioned, it's already in at least 1 crate, possibly many more). So it would probably have to live across an edition change. It's possibly too late to get a fix in for Rust 2021.\n\nFor now, I've suggested it as a [possible lint in clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/7301)\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85883/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85883/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
