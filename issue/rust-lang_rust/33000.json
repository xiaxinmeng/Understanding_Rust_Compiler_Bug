This means we could potentially have regressions in terms of readability that we don't immediately catch.  It also means that possibly future improvements, like #32756, don't have a way to thoroughly catch where tweaks to formatting one one kind of error impact other errors in unintended ways.\n\nA possible additional aspect of this kind of UI testing is that it allows us to not only test formatting but optionally we could also add the ability to test the highlighting to ensure that the errors are using the expected coloring.\n\nAdditionally, we currently have hacks in the unit test suite that check for column offsets (like compile-fail/symbol-names/issue-32709.rs).  Having a more structured UI test allows tests to do specific formatting checks like column numbers.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33000/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33000/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
