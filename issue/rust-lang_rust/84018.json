For example:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nif false {\r\n    println!(\"never executed\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally the second line would show a coverage execution count of `0`, but, assuming this snippet is executed, it would instead show something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1   if false {\r\n        println!(\"never executed\");\r\n1   }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe coverage percentage for this block would be computed as 100%, but should be about 66% (by lines covered).\r\n\r\nThe MIR `InstrumentCoverage` pass is performed before MIR optimizations, so the coverage instrumentation is available in MIR for line 2. However, subsequent optimizations drop the MIR block, including the coverage `Statement` before the codegen phase. The coverage map is generated during codegen, and can use `tcx` queries to extract data from the `optimized_mir()`, but that version of the MIR has already been purged of the unreachable blocks.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, `tcx` queries for intermediate MIR representations (for example, `tcx.mir_promoted()`) are not available at codegen (they have already been \"stolen\" by the optimization passes).\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, I believe I need to cache at least the coverage statements (or their data at least) for the pre-optimized MIR, before those statements are potentially dropped by subsequent MIR passes.\r\n\r\ncc: @tmandry @wesleywiser ", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84018/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84018/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
