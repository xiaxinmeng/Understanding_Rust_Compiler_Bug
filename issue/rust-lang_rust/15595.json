This should take a similar approach to `TcpStream` and friends by supporting a `close_accept()` method which will force all accept loops to return.\n\nThis will notably allow for accept() on the same socket concurrently, which needs to be accounted for. Unlike concurrent reads/writes this should be pretty easy to deal with.\n\n|  | libuv | native unix | native windows |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| TcpAcceptor::clone | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 |\n| TcpAcceptor::close_accept | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 |\n| UnixAcceptor::clone | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 |\n| UnixAcceptor::close_accept | \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 |\n\nWIP: https://github.com/alexcrichton/rust/tree/issue-15595\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15595/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15595/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
