Similarly for the mut versions (AsMut, DerefMut, etc), and a few similar methods I tried (Borrow::borrow for example).\r\n\r\nThere are probably some other similar issues too (it seems a lot of our library code is optimized for `-Copt-level=3` rather than with size optimizations...).\r\n\r\nNote that this can end up with a lot of copies of these functions, since you get at least one for each `T` you use `Vec<T>::deref` with, which is basically one for each `T` you put in a `Vec`.\r\n\r\nAlso note that these get fully optimized away on both `-Copt-level=3` and `-Copt-level=2`.\r\n\r\nOne way to fix this is probably to make these `#[inline(always)]`, but it seems weird that these would show up at all, so perhaps there's a better way which can fix the issue more broadly.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/89389/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/89389/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
