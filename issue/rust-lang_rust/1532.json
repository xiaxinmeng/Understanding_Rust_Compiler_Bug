Looking at the code, it's fairly clear that `ast_util::uint_ty_to_str()` is wrong:\n\n```\nfn uint_ty_to_str(t: uint_ty) -> str {\n    alt t {\n      ty_u. { \"\" } ty_u8. { \"u8\" } ty_u16. { \"u16\" }\n      ty_u32. { \"u32\" } ty_u64. { \"u64\" }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI was just going to fix this function... but then I found that almost every other example of printing `10u` which I have tried works!  I cannot for the life of me figure out why.  I _believe_ I've even seen the output vary from run to run.  So I'm wondering if there is a deeper bug: I've been digging into it but haven't found it yet.  I'm getting a bit bored of this bug though and want to get hacking on other things, so I'm filing an issue.  Anyhow, maybe someone else has some idea what's going on?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "marijnh", "id": 144427, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144427?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh", "html_url": "https://github.com/marijnh", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1532/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1532/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
