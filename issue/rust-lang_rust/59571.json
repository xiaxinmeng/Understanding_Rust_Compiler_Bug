One idea to do this would be to implement a custom allocator which could record statistics for memory allocated and deallocated. This allocator could also be integrated with rustc's arenas so that we could see exactly how much memory is used by each arena at any given instant. \r\n\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/59571/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/59571/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
