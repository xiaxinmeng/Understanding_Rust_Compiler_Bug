I can get the ICE with just `RUST_LOG=rustc::traits::select` (IIRC), but not when I include other modules.\r\n\r\nThe cycle error comes from the pretty printer, in particular [this line](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/ty/print/pretty.rs#L547). I managed to resolve the issue, [here's the diff that fixed it](https://gist.github.com/davidtwco/2ad19e572b568bc3464563c4a13bb208) - when the pretty printer calls `predicates_of` for existential types then it ends up calling code with debug logs that print the same type, causing a cycle.\r\n\r\nThe diff above only bypasses the cycle error when `RUST_LOG=rustc::ty::subst,rustc::ty::context,rustc_typeck`, I assume it won't when you add more modules.
