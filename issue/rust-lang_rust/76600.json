Some of these things have manifested themselves in run-time problems observed on NetBSD: (detected) deadlocks in ld.elf_so (resulting in abort), deadlocks related to malloc() manifesting as hangs etc.  In NetBSD, the fork() man page contains this passage:\r\n\r\n```\r\n     Child processes of a threaded program have additional restrictions, a\r\n     child must only call functions that are async-signal-safe.  Very few\r\n     functions are asynchronously safe (the list may be found in sigaction(2))\r\n     and applications should make sure they call exec(3) as soon as possible.\r\n```\r\n\r\nA Linux/Debian man  page for fork(2) also contains a similar passage:\r\n\r\n```\r\n       *  After a fork() in a multithreaded program, the child can safely call\r\n          only async-signal-safe functions (see signal-safety(7))  until  such\r\n          time as it calls execve(2).\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though I don't point to offending code here, I have it on good authority that this is the root cause of the issues we have been observing on NetBSD.  Is there any chance that the rust code could have a make-over so as to not rely on undefined behavior in this aspect?\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76600/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76600/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
