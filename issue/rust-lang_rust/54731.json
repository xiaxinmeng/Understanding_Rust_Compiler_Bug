(The crate contains a SIMD implementation, but this benchmark is testing the non-SIMD one, defined in `src/portable.rs`.)\r\n\r\nWhen I run the commands above, my laptop (i5-8250U) shows 165 ns/iter pretty consistently. However, if I set `RUSTFLAGS=\"-C target-cpu=native\"` or `RUSTFLAGS=\"-C target-cpu=skylake\"` and rerun it, then performance drops 30% to 214 ns/iter. You can see the result of autovectorization here (with the relevant code tweaked to avoid depending on external crates): https://godbolt.org/z/Mg86_h. Are perf issues like this expected, or does it indicate some kind of bug in the optimizer?\r\n\r\nNotably, if I target the modern processor but suppress vectorization, with something like `RUSTFLAGS=\"-C target-cpu=skylake -C target-feature=-avx2\"`, performance is great. I get 155 ns/iter. So it seems like the vectorizer is specifically at fault here, and not something else about targeting the modern CPU.", "closed_by": {"login": "workingjubilee", "id": 46493976, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDkzOTc2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46493976?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee", "html_url": "https://github.com/workingjubilee", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54731/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54731/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
