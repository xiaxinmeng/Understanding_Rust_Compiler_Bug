The following calling to `push` will then allocate to reserve additional memory for the null-terminating character.\n\nThis could be resolved in two ways:\n\n1) Call `Vec::with_capacity(EncodeWide::size_hint + 1)` beforehand and then call `Vec::extend` on EncodeWide.\n2) Make a wrapper around `EncodeWide` that increases `iter::size_hint` by one. Incorporating the final null byte into `iter::next` would add a performance penalty, therefore it would probably be desirable to just adjust the size_hint by one and adding the null-terminator manually.\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"AronParker\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": {"login": "AronParker", "id": 2510861, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTA4NjE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2510861?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/AronParker", "html_url": "https://github.com/AronParker", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AronParker/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AronParker/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AronParker/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AronParker/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AronParker/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AronParker/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AronParker/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AronParker/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AronParker/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/96297/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/96297/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
