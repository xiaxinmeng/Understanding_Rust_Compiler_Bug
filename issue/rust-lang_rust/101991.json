improving error/diagnostic quality for macros I'd like to try and get some of the `proc_macro_span` feature stabilized. \r\n\r\nWhile some of these APIs don't seem to have consensus on their effect on IDE/language server support, the `source_text` API seems both well-tested and to have consensus that its result only being invalidated by edits to the contents of the macro makes it a non-issue for IDE support (as [noted by niko](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54725) in #54725).\r\n\r\n#### API\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl Span {\r\n    pub fn source_text(&self) ->
