I received [an error message](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1220307#c9) about incompatible versions.  But AFAICT, the Android standard libraries and the Rust I was using were built from the same revision (c30b771ad), so they ought to have been compatible...?\n\n@alexcrichton [said](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1220307#c12)\n\n> Oh hm it looks like it's actually just doing a string comparison of the CFG_VERSION values at build-time. This I think includes the version information like 1.6.0 vs nightly. That means that if the android library is configured as built from a nightly compiler at a specific revision it's incompatible with a stable compiler at the same revision (as the version numbers are different). That... may be a bug in our compiler!\n\nIt's possible I'm mistaken about how things are supposed to work; filing this as a place to discuss.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31393/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31393/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
