IEEE 754-2008 (section 8.2.1 in the [latest draft](http://754r.ucbtest.org/web-2008/drafts/archive/2006-10-04.pdf)) specifies quiet NaNs to have their first bit of the trailing significand field set to 1, for signaling NaNs it should be set to 0. Some MIPS based platforms have it reversed. Should they be cfg'd out?", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40470/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40470/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
