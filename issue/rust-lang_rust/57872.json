I then tried to test this by using this iterator in a for loop. I got the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n     for (i, j) in foo\r\n         ^^^^^^ expected struct `MyIter`, found tuple\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis left me confused, because I had assumed that foo's type was MyIter. Why was the iterator returning itself, instead of the item type I had specified? I began to suspect my implementation of IntoIterator before I realized that foo was actually `Option<MyIter>`. As it turns out, Option also implements IntoIterator (#27996), so the compiler thought I was trying to iterate over the Option instead of the enclosed type!\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice if there were a note associated with the compiler error in cases where the iterator is type `Option<T : IntoIterator>`. Something like this, maybe?\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"Note: `iter` is `Option<MyIter>`. Did you forget to unwrap?\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimple reproduction of the compiler error:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=4432a78517e24ea649a31c7246b34edd", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57872/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57872/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
