I think we should forbid functions with signature `fn (&str) -> &str` that actually return `&'static str`. Instead of `quux`, programmers should use `baz`.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "japaric", "id": 5018213, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTgyMTM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5018213?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric", "html_url": "https://github.com/japaric", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/japaric/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16083/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16083/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
