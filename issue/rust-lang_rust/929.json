I see a way to do the first option, by making pprust::print_maybe_parens_discrim recurse right. I could write that patch, along with tests, if you think it's the right thing to do.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "catamorphism", "id": 427212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzIxMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/427212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism", "html_url": "https://github.com/catamorphism", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/929/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/929/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
