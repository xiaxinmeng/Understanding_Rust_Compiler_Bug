The main reason for this is that it was impossible to have a static library build dependency because the link arguments would always be propagated (and the library is only available during the build process).\n\nNow that we have a proper linkage system set up (after #10528), we may want to consider re-propagating these dependencies. I have seen many failed compilations due to this not occurring (one is in issue #10543), and it seems reasonable to do this.\n\nBecause we would only do this for native _dynamic_ dependencies, the dependency must already be in place to use the upstream crate, so why not just link it to the downstream crate?\n\nI'm personally in favor of this (due to having a distinction between dynamic/static native libraries now), and I believe that this should be done.\n\nNominating for discussion.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10743/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10743/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
