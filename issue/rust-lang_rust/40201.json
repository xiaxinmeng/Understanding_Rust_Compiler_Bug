This poses problems in portability and accuracy. For example, the bottom of the backtrace is not cleaned when the panic is in a test or an other thread.\r\n\r\nI propose that just before calling the user main/test/closure, the calling code would capture a backtrace. Then, on panic, the frames present is the backtrace pre and post panic would be removed. That way, no need to have a big whitelist. Some small post-processing may be needed to remove some additional frames.\r\n\r\nA few questions:\r\n- Is `__rust_maybe_catch_panic` used on all the platforms? If so, it could be used as a basis for this technique, since it's used for tests, the main thread and the secondary threads.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40201/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40201/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
