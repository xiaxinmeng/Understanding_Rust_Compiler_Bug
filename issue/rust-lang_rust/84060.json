Otherwise provide a short summary of the\r\nfeature and link any relevant PRs or issues, and remove any sections that are\r\nnot relevant to the feature.\r\n\r\nRemember to add team labels to the tracking issue.\r\nFor a language team feature, this would e.g., be `T-lang`.\r\nSuch a feature should also be labeled with e.g., `F-my_feature`.\r\nThis label is used to associate issues (e.g., bugs and design questions) to the feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for the `rustc_main` internal attribute, which is not intended for stablization.\r\nThe feature gate for the issue is `#![feature(rustc_main)]`.\r\n\r\nThe intention of this attribute is to finish the migration and removal of `#[main]` attribute and to support implementing\r\nRFC 1260 on top of this.\r\n\r\n### About tracking issues\r\n\r\nTracking issues are used to record the overall progress of implementation.\r\nThey are also used as hubs connecting to other relevant issues, e.g., bugs or open design questions.\r\nA tracking issue is however *not* meant for large scale discussion, questions, or bug reports about a feature.\r\nInstead, open a dedicated issue for the specific matter and add the relevant feature gate label.\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Implementation history\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a list of all the PRs that were involved in implementing the feature.\r\n-->\r\n- Initial implementation: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84062", "closed_by": {"login": "crlf0710", "id": 451806, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTgwNg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/451806?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710", "html_url": "https://github.com/crlf0710", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crlf0710/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84060/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84060/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
