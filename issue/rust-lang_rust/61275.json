The function has the layout MKL_LONG DftiSetValue(DFTI_DESCRIPTOR_HANDLE, enum DFTI_CONFIG_PARAM, ...), the first is an 8 byte pointer (windows 64 bit), the second is an enum which is 4 bytes long, and the last parameter is a floating point number.\r\n\r\nI can call this function from c++ just fine as a float or double, but cannot call this from rust without making it a double.  This is with the enum being treated as 32 bit int, and I get an error if I try to call it with a u4 from the ux package.  According to the documentation this function should be a float because I am using floating point fft precision.\r\n\r\nI have attached some code that shows the fft being called with some sample values and you can see that one time it is called and returns all zeros which is incorrect and the second time it is called it comes back correctly with non-zero values.\r\n\r\n[Example.zip](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/files/3228689/Example.zip)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/61275/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/61275/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
