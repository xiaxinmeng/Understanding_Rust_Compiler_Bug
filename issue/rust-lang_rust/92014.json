Most queries only cache results for local `DefIds`, so this can usually open happen when macros are involved (e.g. a `mir::Body` containing identifiers expanded from a foreign macro). Since macros executions occur before the incremental cache is set up, we should always have the necessary foreign `SourceFile`s loaded before we try to decode any foreign `Span`s from the incremental cache.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I don't think it's actually possible to hit this in practice. However, trying to cache a query result for a foreign `DefId` can easily hit this - the foreign files associated with the spans we encode need not be loaded by any of the macros that we invoke. We should either make this a requirement of query caching (`cache_on_disk_if { key.is_local() }` must always be used when the result can contain foreign `Span`, or adjust the incremental cache to correctly load foreign files when decoding `Span`s.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/92014/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/92014/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
