Our submodules, however, are much larger and unfortunately cannot be cloned with a `--depth` argument due to how the branches work. This typically means that cloning the LLVM repo takes quite a long time! Unfortunately this also [increases our chances](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/40474) to network problems by requiring a lot of data to move over the network.\r\n\r\nWhen playing around with CircleCI recently I found that they automatically cached git repository data which greatly sped up cloning the repository and checking out submodules. Overall it felt quite nifty! We should investigate to see if a similar strategy can apply to Travis and/or AppVeyor. I'm not personally familiar with how CircleCI's git caching works, so some investigation there would be needed (and comments if you're familiar with it would be most welcome!)\r\n\r\nOverall I would expec this change to:\r\n\r\n* Reduce timeouts when cloning LLVM because very little data would transfer over the network\r\n* Speed up builds (slightly). It'd save ~10 minutes on AppVeyor and ~2 minutes on Travis from the look of today's timings.\r\n\r\nAny help to implement this would be very much appreciated!", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40772/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40772/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
