However `Self` is concrete. `Self` may not be sized, but `&Self` certainly is. `mem::size_of` is a const fn, so [this code](https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=ba7372f0d844c49ea3f4b338180f67d3&version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2015) proves that the size is known at compile time! Well, it maybe a matter of precisely when in the compile time. Anyways, that code should totally compile.\r\n\r\n## Workaround 1\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Blah {\r\n    fn as_blah(&self) -> &Blah;\r\n    \u2026\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Workaround 2\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Blah {\r\n    fn test(&self, this: &Blah) {\r\n        \u2026\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Workaround 3\r\nManually construct the reference, somehow.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54998/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54998/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
