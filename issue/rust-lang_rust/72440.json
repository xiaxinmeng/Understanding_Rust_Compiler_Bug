Make sure to include the relevant\r\nRFC for the feature if it has one. Otherwise provide a short summary of the\r\nfeature and link any relevant PRs or issues, and remove any sections that are\r\nnot relevant to the feature.\r\n\r\nRemember to add team labels to the tracking issue.\r\nFor a language team feature, this would e.g., be `T-lang`.\r\nSuch a feature should also be labeled with e.g., `F-my_feature`.\r\nThis label is used to associate issues (e.g., bugs and design questions) to the feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for constify-ing non-trait `Duration` methods\r\n\r\nThe feature gates for the issue are `#![feature(duration_consts_2)]` (stabilized in rust 1.58.0) and `#![feature(duration_consts_float)]` (still unstable).\r\n\r\nThe following methods will effectively be made const under the `duration_consts_2` feature:\r\n* `Duration::new` [stable since 1.58.0]\r\n* `Duration::checked_add` [stable since 1.58.0]\r\n* `Duration::saturating_add` [stable since 1.58.0]\r\n* `Duration::checked_sub` [stable since 1.58.0]\r\n* `Duration::saturating_sub` [stable since 1.58.0]\r\n* `Duration::checked_mul` [stable since 1.58.0]\r\n* `Duration::saturating_mul` [stable since 1.58.0]\r\n* `Duration::checked_div` [stable since 1.58.0]\r\n\r\nThe following methods will effectively be made const under the `duration_consts_float` feature:\r\n* `Duration::as_secs_f64` [stabilization blocked by #57241]\r\n* `Duration::as_secs_f32`[stabilization blocked by #57241]\r\n* `Duration::div_duration_f64` [stabilization blocked by #57241]\r\n* `Duration::div_duration_f32` [stabilization blocked by #57241]\r\n* `Duration::from_secs_f64` [stabilization blocked by #57241]\r\n* `Duration::from_secs_f32` [stabilization blocked by #57241]\r\n* `Duration::mul_f64` [stabilization blocked by #57241]\r\n* `Duration::mul_f32` [stabilization blocked by #57241]\r\n* `Duration::div_f64` [stabilization blocked by #57241]\r\n* `Duration::div_f32` [stabilization blocked by #57241]\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n<!--\r\nInclude each step required to complete the feature.
