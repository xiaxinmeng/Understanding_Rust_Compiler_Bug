This is never going to settle down, because new features are going to be added to Rust for as long as it is an actively developed project. Since crates can not have cyclic dependencies, there is not a lot of flexibility to work with.\n\nFor example, one of the map implementations may be used in the standard library in the future. It could continue to be export as a public API in the collections module to maintain backwards compatibility. However, if it is public in the standard library too, then it cannot ever move out of the standard library if the dependency is dropped.\n\nThere should be support in the compiler and a policy for library development to provide a well-designed, stable API where types are exported where users will expect them (e.g. by re-exporting types where the actual definition happens in another crate). For example, `UnsafeArc` would be expected to exist in the `libsync` module as a basis for new concurrent data structures like a concurrent hash table or LRU cache. It's immaterial whether the standard library makes use of it internally (or `Arc`/`MutexArc`/`RWArc`) when it comes to API design.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12876/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12876/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
