What is the intended way to do this? And if there's not really a way to do it, then maybe this change should be reverted so there isn't any break.\r\n\r\nI thought of `#[cfg_attr(doctest, macro_export)]`, which does make even older Rust try to test it, but that still can't reach the macro because it's still using the non-`doctest` build of the crate.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPS: I ended up making unit tests for that rayon macro, which is probably better in that case, but that doesn't answer how non-exported macro tests should work.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97030/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97030/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
