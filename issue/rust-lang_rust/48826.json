The suspected cause here is the fact that the run-pass test suite takes >1hr to run and the suspected cause there is that we're effectively compiling every test with LTO which can take quite some time.\r\n\r\nThis issue is intended to track possible solutions to bring the builder back under control. Today in a discussion a few possible avenues arose:\r\n\r\n* Shard the asm.js builder into two builders, each running half the run-pass tests\r\n* Stop running the full test suite for asm.js altogether, we seem to regress this *very* rarely\r\n* Stop optimizing tests, debug mode may be much faster.\r\n\r\ncc @kennytm \r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48826/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48826/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
