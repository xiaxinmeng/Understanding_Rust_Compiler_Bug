My hypothesis at first was that on OS X, this was effectively extending the environment instead of overwriting the entire environment. However, I think there might be something more that's wrong. Code:\n\n```\nuse std::{io, run, str};\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut outp = run::Process::new(\"/bin/echo\", [~\"monkeybutts\"],\n            run::ProcessOptions {\n            env: Some(&[(~\"QUUX\", ~\"blat\")]),\n            dir: None,\n            in_fd: None,\n            out_fd: None,\n            err_fd: None\n        });\n    let rs = outp.finish_with_output();\n    io::println(fmt!(\"output: %s\", str::from_bytes(rs.output)));\n\n```\n\nThe resulting executable sometimes prints out \"output: monkeybutts\" but sometimes prints out just \"output:\". So the process I'm spawning doesn't use the environment at all, but adding an environment variable still makes it non-deterministically print the wrong result. This doesn't happen if I change the `env` field to `None`.\n\nI'm investigating more, just wanted to write this down.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "catamorphism", "id": 427212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzIxMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/427212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism", "html_url": "https://github.com/catamorphism", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8482/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8482/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
