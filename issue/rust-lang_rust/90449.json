The detail is ``this `CString` is deallocated at the end of the statement, bind it to a variable to extend its lifetime`` which is expected :ok: .\r\nIf you run the code, a \"random\" character will be printed and that's of course unexpected. A solution is an assignment of the string into a standalone variable as explained [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ffi/struct.CString.html#method.as_ptr).\r\n\r\n---\r\nHave the same code, but this time it uses `String` instead of `CString`:\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let pointer = String::from(\"Hello world!\").as_ptr();\r\n\r\n    unsafe {\r\n        println!(\"{:?}\", *pointer as char);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**I expected to see this happen:**\r\n* I should get similar kind of warning as in case of `CString`, because also in this case the pointer is dangling and if you run the code, a random character will be printed. A solution is the same as for `CString`\r\n\r\n**Instead, this happened:**\r\n* Rust doesn't warn\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n<!--\r\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\r\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.58.0-nightly (e249ce6b2 2021-10-30)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: e249ce6b2345587d6e11052779c86adbad626dff\r\ncommit-date: 2021-10-30\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.58.0-nightly\r\nLLVM version: 13.0.0\r\n```\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90449/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90449/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
