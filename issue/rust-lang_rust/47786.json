This is important for error messages that are comparable with rustc's errors, explained further in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38356#issuecomment-354526418.\r\n- [ ] **https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48188** The naming of TokenTree::kind is confusing. I would expect either `kind: TokenKind` or `node: TokenNode`, not `kind: TokenNode`.\r\n- [ ] **https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48189** Doc comments should be parsed as a sequence of tokens `#` `[` `doc` `=` ... `]` rather than as a TokenNode::Literal. I believe this approach has worked well for macros-by-example. Nobody considers doc comments to be a type of \"literal\" and it can be surprising when they pop up this way.", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47786/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47786/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
