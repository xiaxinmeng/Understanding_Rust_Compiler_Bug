For now people simply have to remember not to use it with re-exports, but it would be nice if it either 1) worked as expected, or at least 2) caused a compiler error so that it couldn't pass silently.\r\n\r\nOpen question: should the chosen behavior extend to the stable `#[deprecated]` attribute as well? If made to work on re-exports this will be a slight increase to the API surface area, but if made into an error it could potentially be a breaking change (although easily understood and justified as a bugfix).\r\n\r\nTest case for `#[deprecated]`:\r\n```rust\r\nmod foo {\r\n    #[deprecated]\r\n    pub use crate::bar::Bar;\r\n}\r\n\r\nmod bar {\r\n    pub struct Bar;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let _ = foo::Bar; // should warn\r\n    let _ = bar::Bar; // should not warn\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce (if) this is fixed, then we should go through the stdlib and use this to replace all of the wrapper functions/type aliases that are currently used to trigger deprecated lints (e.g. the items in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82122 ). Better to have a deprecated path than a full-fledged item and symbol.", "closed_by": {"login": "bstrie", "id": 865233, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTIzMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/865233?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie", "html_url": "https://github.com/bstrie", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82123/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82123/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
