If you focus the search box and type \"StructOptions\", you will end up with \"tructOptions\" in the search field. I believe this is because rustdoc uses the \"s\" character to focus the search box, but doesn't register that the search box is already focused. \r\n\r\nIt seems to only appear when the search box is first focused. If the search box already contains text, the issue does not appear, as you saw me type \"Some\" without effort. However with the search term \"StructOptions\", \"star\" and \"secret-sauce\", you can see that the first character gets ignored. \r\n\r\nThis doesn't happen on documentation that was using the current stable build of rustc, only the nightly version. In the GIF I built the current webrender library using `cargo doc --open` on rustc nightly. It's simply highly annoying that my \"s\" key is eemingly broken (:wink:).
