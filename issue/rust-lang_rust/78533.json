The unstable [`cargo -Zbuild-std` feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std) was introduced to address this issue, allowing you to ask cargo to rebuild std with your current RUSTFLAGS.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is a bit messy to work with, and produces a lot of redundant work. Especially in the context of [CI with vendored environments](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1671691). It would be nice if prebuilt stds were provided for some configurations. \r\n\r\nSanitizers that merit consideration:\r\n* [ ] ThreadSanitizer (tsan) -- requires an instrumented build to work right\r\n* [ ] MemorySanitizer (msan) -- requires an instrumented built to work right\r\n* [ ] AddressSanitizer (asan) -- can produce more accurate results with an instrumented built\r\n\r\nFor reference, Firefox is currently only using the -Zsanitizer flag for its \"linux64\" tsan builds, which I believe are currently debian8-amd64 machines. We have [asan tasks in many different configurations](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/search?q=-asan&path=&case=false&regexp=false), but evidently we haven't yet bothered to use -Zsanitizer for them (presumably because it's not required).\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested to provide builds for all the tier1 platforms, but I don't personally have an opinion on that.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/78533/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/78533/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
