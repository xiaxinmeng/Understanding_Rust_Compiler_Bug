What follows is @jsha's summary of the idea:\r\n\r\nWhen markdown like `# Examples` is processed, it usually turns into something like `<a href=\"#examples\" id=\"examples\">`. This is useful so you can click on the heading and get a link that will take someone else to that precise part of the docs.\r\n\r\nSince the markdown in rustdoc is user-generated, those anchor ids may conflict with Rustdoc's own anchor ids. They may also conflict with other markdown sections within the same doc page. For instance, see:\r\n\r\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/string/struct.String.html#examples\r\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/string/struct.String.html#examples-1\r\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/string/struct.String.html#examples-2\r\n\r\nRight now we disambiguate these ids by added a number at the end. However, it would be better to disambiguate them by namespacing. Specifically, each time we render markdown we should provide a \"prefix\", and all IDs in the generated HTML should start with that prefix. In general a convenient and sensible choice for this prefix would be the id of the immediately preceding heading. So the examples linked above might become `#top.examples`, `#method.new.examples`, and `#method.from_utf8.examples`.\r\n\r\nThis has three advantages:\r\n - It systematically removes most of the cases of id conflict.\r\n - It makes anchor links more meaningful when someone reads the URL.\r\n - It makes anchor links stable across revisions.\r\n\r\nThis is a 99% solution, not a 100% one. Users can author HTML directly in their markdown, for instance `<div id=\"foo\">`. But we are okay with letting the conflicts happen in those rare cases.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/91759/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/91759/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
