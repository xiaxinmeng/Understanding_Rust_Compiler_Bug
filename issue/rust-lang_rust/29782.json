That means we have to keep the (big) tables around longer than is nice and means we are open to hygiene bugs where people forget to do mtwt resolution.\n\nA better solution is to eagerly do mtwt resolution as part of the HIR lowering step. This also means no more `Ident`s in the HIR, only `Name`s, which is a plus.\n\nHappy to mentor this, it's probably better as a second or third bug than a first though since its not super easy.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nrc", "id": 762626, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjYyNg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/762626?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc", "html_url": "https://github.com/nrc", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29782/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29782/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
