It was even stranger when I found that it would work in a Fedora chroot on my tablet (Android kernel), but failed under a full Fedora system.  I finally realized that Fedora's kernel is using 64k pages, and Rust's jemalloc is built for 4k.\n\nI filed jemalloc/jemalloc#467 for compiled-in page sizes.  The result is that most `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)` calls are failing due to alignment, which wouldn't be a big deal, but a few happen to align correctly.  However, the kernel _rounds up_ the requested length to a full 64k page, so it actually clears a lot more memory than intended.  It doesn't take long for a nulled pointer to get dereferenced and crash.\n\nSo on the Rust side, this might be more fuel for switching the default allocator, cc #36963.  Or perhaps Rust's jemalloc tree can be patched the same as Firefox's mozjemalloc to read the page size at runtime.\n\nIn the meantime, those `madvise` calls can be disabled by the environment:\n    `export MALLOC_CONF=lg_dirty_mult:-1`\nSo far, that works for me, and I'll try a full build soon.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36994/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36994/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
