I recently came across a case where the two types had identifiers of the same length with no type arguments, but that were not local so the path was quite long. It took me some time to realize that the two types were actually different and not caused by different crate versions. It'd be nice if for the following, only the parts of the path that differ were highlighted/bolded in the CLI output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexpected: foo::bar::Baz\r\n   found: foo::bar::Bar\r\n                    ^^^ should highlight only this area\r\n```\r\n\r\nCC #43354", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57413/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57413/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
