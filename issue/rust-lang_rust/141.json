This can be noticed in the parse_carg function, it begins by matching (peek ps) against IDENT _, the IDENT token doesn't include stars (that is what the STAR token is for). Note that parse_carg_base seems to be able to handle stars (it matches against STAR). \n\nAn example of non-working code for this is:\n// -_\\- rust -_-\n\ntype list = tag(cons(int,@list), nil());\ntype bubu = rec(int x, int y);\n\nfn less_than(int x, int y) -> bool { ret x < y; }\n\ntype ordered_range = rec(int low, int high) : less_than(*.low, *.high);\n\nfn main() {\n  cons(10, @cons(11, @cons(12, @nil())));\n}\n\nThis code returns with an error saying that \\* is unexpected.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/141/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/141/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
