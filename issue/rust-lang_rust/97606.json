On LP64, these fields will have unequal sizes.  But its `PartialEq` and `Hash` implementations only check the smallest field.  So the following code should fail (untested, because I don't have access to a Mac):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse libc::semun;\r\n\r\n#[test]\r\nfn semun_eq() {\r\n    let x = semun{ val: 0x44556677 };\r\n    let y = semun{ array: 0x0011223344556677 };\r\n    assert!(x != y);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA similar situation holds on Linux for `__c_anonymous_ptrace_syscall_info_data`.  That union has three members of different sizes, and its `PartialEq` implementation will return turn as long as *any* pair of fields compare equal.  Effectively, that means it's only comparing the smallest field.\r\n\r\nThere are other unions in libc, but I haven't audited them all.", "closed_by": {"login": "asomers", "id": 129721, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTcyMQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129721?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/asomers", "html_url": "https://github.com/asomers", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asomers/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asomers/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asomers/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asomers/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asomers/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asomers/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asomers/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asomers/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asomers/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97606/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97606/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
