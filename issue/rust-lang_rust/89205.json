This case of the error can be fixed by additionally requiring `T: for<'a> Foo<'a>` when implementing `Bar`, however this will just shift the problem to whoever tries to use `Bar`. \r\n\r\nAnyway the help message is just wrong because `T` can't be restrained by `'a`, and trying `for<'a> T: 'a` just generates another identical error (which again suggest to bound `T` by `'a`). \r\n\r\nThe suggestion also led me to write something like this ([playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=328332f623d0aa0a9d42c84a6f1fdeb6)):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Foo where for<'a> Self: 'a {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn nightly and stable 1.54 (and older) the error message is pretty much the same the one already posted, the only difference with the other snippet is that I haven't found any workaround to make this compile.\r\n\r\nInterestingly on stable 1.55 and beta it ICE, so it's technically a regression from stable to stable, however it's already fixed, so I don't think it's a big deal.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/89205/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/89205/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
