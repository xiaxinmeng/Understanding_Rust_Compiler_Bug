However, as @apoelstra notes in #16559 it may be more natural for sets to be ordered by _inclusion_. That is, `a<=b` if `a subseteq b`. \n\nHowever, there is no total ordering over set inclusion. It instead forms a diamond-shaped DAG. Thus, Sets would not implement Ord under this scheme. In fact, almost all pairs of sets would have `cmp` yield `None`, which makes it a not-very-useful operator for generic comparison. Further, inclusion relationships are already provided by the actual Set api. \n", "closed_by": {"login": "Gankra", "id": 1136864, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjExMzY4NjQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1136864?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra", "html_url": "https://github.com/Gankra", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16570/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16570/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
