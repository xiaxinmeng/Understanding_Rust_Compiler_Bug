So it's basically a stress test for proc macro expansion.\r\n\r\n#59476 helped a tiny bit. #59507 helped more. The major remaining source of inefficiency is `libproc_macro`'s buffer for communicating between client and server. `Buffer::write_all` is called more than a million times, almost always for a single byte, mostly due to uleb128 encoding of integers. @eddyb said they would try to improve that code.
