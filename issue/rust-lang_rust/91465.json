One of the few (small) pain points it gives me is when a bracket is missing (or a stray one is added), this sometimes happens when I translate some Python code to Rust, or when I add some calls to macros that need brackets (like foo!{...}).\r\n\r\nIn the last of such cases I got an error message like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nerror: unexpected closing delimiter: `}`\r\n   --> ...\\some_program.rs:636:1\r\n    |\r\n12  | fn main() {\r\n    |           - this opening brace...\r\n...\r\n619 |     }\r\n    |     - ...matches this closing brace\r\n...\r\n636 | }\r\n    | ^ unexpected closing delimiter\r\n\r\nerror: aborting due to previous error\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem was at line 361 and to find it I have had to comment-out chunks of code in some kind of binary search :-( Similar situations have happened to me several times in the last years of coding in Rust.\r\n\r\nAssuming my Rust code is indented well enough, the question is: it's possible to improve the parser heuristics to give some hints were the brackets problem could be?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/91465/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/91465/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
