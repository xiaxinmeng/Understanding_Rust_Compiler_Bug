As far as I know the only difference between the two is how they interact with tuple-struct constructors:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub struct MyStruct(u32);\r\n\r\npub use self::MyStruct as PubUse;\r\npub type PubType = MyStruct;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let _ = PubUse(5); // OK\r\n    // let _ = PubType(5); // Doesn't work\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens because tuple struct constructors are just free functions with the same ident as the type they're constructing. `use` statements bring in items from all 3 namespaces that match the given ident but `type` items only alias the type itself.\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by making it so that the compiler generates a constructor for the alias when it sees that the `RHS` of the type alias is a tuple-struct. This would be a breaking change because users can already define a free function with the same name as the type alias, which people do currently do to add the necessary constructor to work around this very issue.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this @joshtriplett has recommended the following steps:\r\n\r\n- [ ] implement the alias constructor fix as a feature gated PR\r\n- [ ] add an allow by default lint to detect free functions that would conflict with the newly generated constructors\r\n  - [ ] do a crater run with the above lint set to deny to measure the impact of this change\r\n  - [ ] add this lint to the future-compatibility lint group", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73191/reactions", "total_count": 17, "+1": 14, "-1": 3, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73191/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
