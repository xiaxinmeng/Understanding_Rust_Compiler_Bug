An override of initializer() would skip this, or I suppose there could be some extra special casing so that the read_to_end state isn't lost during poll, but that seems like more work.\r\n\r\nI think windows avoids this entirely, but the commented-out select-based read2 impl in redox would also want this for redox's FileDesc.", "closed_by": {"login": "sfackler", "id": 1455697, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTU2OTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1455697?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler", "html_url": "https://github.com/sfackler", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53980/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53980/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
