Perhaps these `ByRef` wrappers could be removed altogether in favour of an implementation of `Iterator` for `&mut I` where `I: Iterator`, and similar implementations for `Reader` and `Writer`. That would mean that `foo.by_ref()` could be replaced by the simpler `&mut foo`.\n\nI tried to do this myself, but strangely ran into errors whenever `.take()` or `.map()` got called on something that wasn\u2019t an iterator.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "ftxqxd", "id": 2055302, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTUzMDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2055302?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd", "html_url": "https://github.com/ftxqxd", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19373/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19373/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
