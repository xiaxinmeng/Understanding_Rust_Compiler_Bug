The `issue-42552` test originally covered this case, but seems like that's not the case anymore. Instead, when attempting a try run the `hyper-0.14.18` benchmark in rustc-perf failed to build.\r\n\r\nThis issue is basically a call to minimize that failure and add a test to the test suite so we properly capture that bug path.\r\n\r\nTo do this, you will need to make a local change like the above, calling `bug!()` instead of returning `Err(NoSolution)`. Then, you can minimize the `hyper-0.14.18` benchmark.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/101694/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/101694/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
