This one has already been fixed in May (https://github.com/llvm-mirror/lldb/commit/e7e7a509827e7b555522c9cef7993e919f54824f) but it still exists in a lot of LLDB binaries out there.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the bug occurs when a number of object files are stored in an archive and the last one ends at an uneven byte offset. This often seems to be the case for compressed byte-code archives in rlibs (maybe regular object files are always padded to an even size?).\n\nI'm currently compiling a possible workaround (pad the bytecode objects to an even size). It would be good if we could allow for rust code to be debugged with older LLDB versions too.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15950/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15950/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
