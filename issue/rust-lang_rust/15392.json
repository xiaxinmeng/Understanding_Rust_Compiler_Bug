Generally, the only new language features added after this milestone must be backwards compatible, or to fix soundness holes, though we do expect to have some leeway to make small incompatible fixes that have low impact on existing code bases.\r\n\r\n* Library stability - We have a system of measuring and ensuring the stability of API's, and a significant portion of the standard library is declared stable. Stable API's will not change. Large portions of the standard library need to be stable for 1.0, including primitive types, vectors, strings, option, numerics, collections, some I/O and concurrency.\r\n\r\n* User experience - The system is polished and the presentation is complete and professional. New users have a clear path to using and learning the system. This encompasses the web site, documentation, installation, and tooling.\r\n", "creator": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 376, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2013-10-10T18:48:33Z", "updated_at": "2016-08-28T23:13:24Z", "due_on": "2015-05-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2015-05-21T20:59:13Z"}, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2014-07-04T00:34:38Z", "updated_at": "2014-07-25T04:01:14Z", "closed_at": "2014-07-25T04:01:14Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Using a constant in an enum with the same name as another constant from another enum in the std module - namely Option in this case - causes an error in a (seemingly) unrelated for-loop. \"Mangling\" the name of this constant - say from None to NoneN - makes the code compile. \n\nCompiler used:\n\n```\nrustc 0.11.0-pre-nightly (eda75bcf42ad99e3e4c99585d39705fccac606ee 2014-07-03 16:56:51 +0000)\n```\n\nCode:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    enum Test { None }\n    for i in range(0, 10u) {\n        println!(\"{}\", i)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n$ rustc debug_2.rs\ndebug_2.rs:3:5: 6:2 error: mismatched types: expected `core::option::Option<uint>` but found `main::Test` (expected enum core::option::Option but found enum main::Test)\ndebug_2.rs:3     for i in range(0, 10u) {\ndebug_2.rs:4         println!(\"{}\", i)\ndebug_2.rs:5     }\ndebug_2.rs:6 }\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15392/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15392/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
