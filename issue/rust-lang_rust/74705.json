This is supported in LLVM 10.~~ Fixed by https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67759.\r\n- [x] NewPM does not support MergeFunctions in LLVM 9. While it's supported in LLVM 10, it's not exposed as a PassBuilder option. We'll have to manually schedule the pass, or add that option upstream.\r\n- [x] `-C passes`. NewPM requires an entirely different way of specifying custom pass pipelines. We should probably expose that functionality, but it doesn't directly map to what `-C passes` does.\r\n- [ ] NewPM has no support for custom inline parameters right now. We'd have to add upstream support for that first.\r\n\r\n### About tracking issues\r\n\r\nTracking issues are used to record the overall progress of implementation. They are also uses as hubs connecting to other relevant issues, e.g., bugs or open design questions. A tracking issue is however *not* meant for large scale discussion, questions, or bug reports about a feature. Instead, open a dedicated issue for the specific matter and add the relevant feature gate label.\r\n\r\n### Implementation history\r\n\r\n- Implemented in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/67954", "closed_by": {"login": "pnkfelix", "id": 173127, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173127?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix", "html_url": "https://github.com/pnkfelix", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74705/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74705/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
