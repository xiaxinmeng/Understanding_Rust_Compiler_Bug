At the very least, it would be nice to tell `rustc` if your planning on targeting 32 or 64 bit in case your building against a library that is currently only available as one or the other. Currently, I think the only way of doing this is to specify a host triple at compile time and build the entire system as one or the other. It would be nice to be able to build universally on OS X and support targeting a specific architecture. The gcc and clang both support  `-m32` or `-m64` as a simple solution to specifying the architecture, as well as `-arch` flags. \n\nWith clang and gcc `-arch` can be used to specify which architectures you want to build for, for example `clang foo.c -o foo.o -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc` will tell the compiler to build a binary that supports 3 different architectures. \n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2024/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2024/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
