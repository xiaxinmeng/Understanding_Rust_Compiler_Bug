This causes problems for Windows users who run on a fresh mingw installation: #5878, #5712.\n\nThere had been several LLVM upgrades since then and apparently the incompatibility issue got fixed somewhere along the way:  I was able to build Rust with GCC 4.7.2 on 64-bit Windows machine without apparent problems. Well, I had to copy old libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll  and libstdc++-6.dll into stage0\\bin to make stage1 compilation work, but other than that everything had worked fine.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "vadimcn", "id": 3203809, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDM4MDk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3203809?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn", "html_url": "https://github.com/vadimcn", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vadimcn/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8598/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8598/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
