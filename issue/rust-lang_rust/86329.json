I expect that an array is not a closure, but I would expect it to be a pattern (Thus, telling me it isn't a closure isn't helpful to me). The second is the actual issue that references to arrays aren't Patterns.\r\nAccording to the `.split` docs, it's valid to pass a slice of `char` to `split` as the pattern. It should follow that you can pass a reference to an array to `.split`, because references to arrays coerce to references to slices. \r\n\r\nBoth issues could be fixed with `impl<const N: usize> Pattern for &[char;N]{...}` in the stdlib. It may also be useful (and was brought up in discussion on the Rust Community Discord), for a non-reference impl `impl<const N: usize> Pattern for [char;N]{...}`. In the former case, it should be achievable by delegating to the slice impl. I am unfamiliar with the implementation in particular, but the same may also be reasonable for the by-value array case.
