It seems that some LLVM optimization pass is producing an irreducible control flow graph, and LLVM's LoopSimplify pass isn't sophisticated enough to undo the damage.\n\nAs a temporary workaround, 43867bf6f333049ede4611c9eace092bfc2b9696 xfails the two tests which break the liveness pass. But we should figure out what LLVM pass is causing the trouble and try to resolve that and un-xfail those tests.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "elliottslaughter", "id": 3129, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3129?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/elliottslaughter", "html_url": "https://github.com/elliottslaughter", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elliottslaughter/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elliottslaughter/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elliottslaughter/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elliottslaughter/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elliottslaughter/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elliottslaughter/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elliottslaughter/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elliottslaughter/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elliottslaughter/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3022/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3022/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
