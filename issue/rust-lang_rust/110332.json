triggered at all for inherent associated types.\nPR #110277 was just merged which started visiting more associated items exposing this bug.\nThe `dead_code` pass never considers IATs as *live symbols* (`live_symbols`) even in cases where they should be.\n\nThis feels like a regression but technically speaking it is not:\nWe switched from one extreme to the other.
