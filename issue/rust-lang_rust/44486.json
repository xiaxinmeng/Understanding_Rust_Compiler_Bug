For better integration with red/green tracking this functionality should be moved into a pair of queries:\r\n* The first query does all of translation item collection *and* partitioning and returns `(set of all trans-items, set of all partitions)`. It can have a query key of `()` as it only takes other queries as input.\r\n* The second query has query-key `cgu_name: &str` and returns the single `CodegenUnit` with that name. It just reads from the result of the first query. It's purpose is to provide a \"firewall\" so codegen units can be re-used if they don't change.\r\n\r\nDoing this refactoring will involve moving `TransItem` and `CodegenUnit` to `librustc`, so they can be used in query results. One will also have to provide a `HashStable` implementation for the results of the two queries. The implementation for `CodegenUnit` should do something like [CodegenUnit::compute_symbol_name_hash()](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/a0b34199ba6f7c922e7832160328c2a4e90b6ac6/src/librustc_trans/partitioning.rs#L176). For translation items one could maybe just hash the symbol name. \r\n\r\ncc @nikomatsakis @alexcrichton ", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44486/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44486/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
