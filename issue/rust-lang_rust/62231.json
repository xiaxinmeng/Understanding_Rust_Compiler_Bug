"active_lock_reason": null, "body": "As suggested by @Centril, this issue is for getting @rust-lang/lang approval for https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/reference/pull/607 (Note: will update that patch to explicitly talk about overflow behavior, once approved here)\r\n\r\ncc #62175\r\n\r\n## Detailed proposal\r\n\r\nThe following casts:\r\n\r\n- `(expr: iM) as fN`\r\n- `(expr: uM) as fN`\r\n- `(expr: f64) as f32`\r\n\r\nall can see values that cannot be represented losslessly in the destination type, e.g.:\r\n- `i32::MAX` is not exactly representable as f32 (though it is less than `f32::MAX`, so it can be rounded to a finite float)\r\n- `u128::MAX` is larger than `f32::MAX`, so it cannot even be rounded to a nearby finite float (it \"overflows\")\r\n- `f64` obviously has more precision than `f32`, so this cast has to round (infinities and NaNs can be carried over to f32, so this is only about finite numbers)\r\n\r\nThese cases are not unsound any more (see #15536), but currently the rounding mode is explicitly \"unspecified\" in the reference. What happens on overflow (e.g. `u128::MAX as f32`) is also not specified explicitly anywhere AFAICT. I proposed to define these casts as follows:\r\n\r\n- rounding mode: to nearest, ties to even (see IEEE 754-2008 \u00a74.3.1)\r\n- on overflow: return infinity (with the sign of the source)\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nLeaving the behavior of this core part of the language unspecified only hinders Rust programmers in using them and causes uncertainty and (de jure) non-portability. They should be defined as *something*, and I argue (round to nearest, overflow to infinity) is the most obvious, most consistent, and most useful choice:\r\n\r\n- IEEE 754-2008 prescribes round-to-nearest as the default rounding mode and returning (+/-) infinity as the default behavior on overflow (see \u00a74.3.3, \u00a77.4 in IEEE 754-2008).\r\n- This rounding mode and overflow behavior gives the closest possible result (which is of course why IEEE 754 makes it the default).\r\n- Other operations in Rust (e.g., string parsing) and conversions in other languages (e.g., [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.3)) also default to these behaviors.\r\n- LLVM and hardware support this rounding mode and overflow handling natively, so it is also efficient.", "closed_by": {"login": "Centril", "id": 855702, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTcwMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/855702?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril", "html_url": "https://github.com/Centril", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62231/reactions", "total_count": 10, "+1": 10, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62231/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
