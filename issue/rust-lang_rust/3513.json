This is not news.  One place we take advantage of this is `vec::push()`, which has the type\n\n```\nfn push<T>(&vec: ~[const T], +val: T) { ... }\n```\n\nThis is unsound because we accept any sort of vector for the argument `vec`, but the type system only guarantees that we'll write back a `const` vector.  I thought this was basically harmless, since vectors are uniques, but I forgot that it also implies that we will be covariant with respect to `T`.  When combined with regions, this leads to bugs like #3501.  However you can create problems without regions too.  Any place where we have subtyping.\n\nAnyway, we had always planned to remove by-mut-ref mode as part of the general \"de-moding\", but I think we should up the priority for this particular mode.  It is not that widely used in any case, though `vec::push()` is certainly frequent.  I am checking out how hard it will be to just purge it altogether.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "catamorphism", "id": 427212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzIxMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/427212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism", "html_url": "https://github.com/catamorphism", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3513/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3513/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
