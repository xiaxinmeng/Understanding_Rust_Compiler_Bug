I figure I'll start with a mutable 256-element array initialised to zeroes and increment the correct field as I go along.\n\nReading the \"Vectors\" section of the Rust Guide, it tells me how to create a literal array:\n\n```\nlet nums = [1i, 2i, 3i];\n```\n\n...and even mentions the abbreviated syntax for the _type_ of such an array:\n\n```\nlet nums: [int, ..3] = [1i, 2i, 3i];\n```\n\n...but it doesn't mention that there's an abbreviated syntax for initialising an array.\n\nIt's possible the Guide is not the right place for this information, but it also wasn't mentioned in Rust By Example. It _is_ mentioned in the language Reference Manual, but that document isn't necessarily aimed at beginners, and I didn't find it until I'd asked in `#rust`, found out the answer, and then searched for it specifically.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16696/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16696/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
