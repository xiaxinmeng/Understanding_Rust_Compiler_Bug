The semantics, however, should remain the same. What this means is that the following steps need to happen:\n1. A new kernel thread is started, probably via `rt::thread::Thread`.\n2. This thread allocates `~Task` and moves it into the appropriate thread-local-storage slot\n3. Invoke the equivalent of `rt::task::Task.run`. This will set up the C++ try/catch block, as well as cleaning up unconditionally after the task runs. (things like deallocating task-local storage, cleaning up GC, clearing out the stdout/logger handles, etc).\n4. Run the input closure.\n\nIn addition, to these steps, the current semantics of `task::spawn` is that nothing is immediately returned, meaning that just using `Thread::start` will not work (because it returns a handle). I believe this will involve adding a `detach` function to the `Thread` struct which would do something along the lines of `pthread_detach` on unix and `CloseHandle` on windows.\n\nWith this in place, I should be able to invoke `task::spawn` with and without the runtime. It is OK to require that a one-time runtime initialization function is run before any of this spawning code to run, but it is not OK for this one-time initialization function to require all future code to be run in a closure (i.e. what happens today).\n\nHence, a program like this should run successfully:\n\n``` rust\nfn start(argc: int, argv: **u8) -> int {\n  rt::init(argc, argv); // may optional, maybe not, depends on implementation\n  do spawn {\n    println!(\"hello from a new rust task running on a different thread!\");\n  }\n  3\n}\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10647/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10647/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
