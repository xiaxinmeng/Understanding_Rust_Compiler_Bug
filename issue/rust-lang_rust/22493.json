List items not separated by blank lines use only _li_ tags (\"tight\" list).  Links in loose lists are displayed in blue and are easily distinguishable as links.  Links in tight lists are normal text colored and do not appear as links (although clicking them still works).  Examples of both list types follow:\n\n```\nLoose List (links are formatted as expected)\n/// * [The Rust Programming Language](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)\n///\n/// * [The Rust Reference](http://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html)\n\nTight List (links are not formatted)\n/// * [The Rust Programming Language](http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)\n/// * [The Rust Reference](http://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html)\n```\n\nAdding the missing formatting to loose lists is difference appears to be straight-forward CSS change.  In `src/librustdoc/html/static/main.css`, two rules control link appearance in loose lists (lines 377 & 378 in the  dfc5c0f1e8799f47f9033bdcc8a7cd8a217620a5 commit):\n\n```\np a { color: #4e8bca; }\np a:hover { text-decoration: underline; }\n```\n\nAdding a second selector to each rule colors the links:\n\n```\np a, li a { color: #4e8bca; }\np a:hover, li a:hover { text-decoration: underline; }\n```\n\nThere are only two other _li_ rules and these do not affect color.  So, the change above may be all that is needed to fix this issue.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22493/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22493/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
