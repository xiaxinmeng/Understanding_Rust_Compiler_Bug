Basically, we take the source distro, apply a few patches, and run x.py with a custom config.toml.\r\n\r\nI am working on 2 things, which are related:\r\n\r\n* We want to build a Rust toolchain that runs on Windows (MinGW). For various reasons, we'd prefer to do this by cross-compiling (i.e. build a Windows rustc on a Linux machine).\r\n\r\n* We want to test our toolchain in our CI pipeline. For example, run `x.py test tests/ui`\r\n\r\nSo, I had the following \"clever\" idea:\r\n\r\n1. Cross-compile a windows toolchain on Linux.\r\n1. Copy it to a Windows machine.\r\n1. In Windows, `x.py --stage 0 test tests/ui` with the stage 0 / bootstrap configured to use my new toolchain.\r\n\r\nI got a very helpful warning that I probably shouldn't be doing this, and inviting me to file this issue. When I proceeded anyway, with `COMPILETEST_FORCE_STAGE0=1`, I got a number of test failures (~200 out of ~13,000). (For comparison, when I ran `x.py test tests/ui` the \"right\" way, the tests all passed, so I'm pretty confident the failures weren't due to our patches and custom configuration.)\r\n\r\nIs there a correct, supported way to do this? That is, run tests \"after-the-fact\" on a toolchain you just built, possibly on a different machine? If not, I am willing to add support for it, if there is interest.\r\n\r\nI found several things that seemed related, but not quite right:\r\n\r\n* According to the [docs](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/tests/intro.html#dist-check), `./x.py test distcheck` applies to a source tarball, not a compiled toolchain.\r\n* The [remote test server](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/tests/running.html#running-tests-on-a-remote-machine) seems to be for testing different **targets**, not for when the toolchain itself is cross-compiled. It also seems like it would be very difficult to use in our CI pipeline. It also seems like it poses security issues in a production environment (opening a port allowing arbitrary code execution).", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108914/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108914/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
