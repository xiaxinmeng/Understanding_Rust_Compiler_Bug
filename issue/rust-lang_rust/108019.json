 let \ud83d\udc31 = ();\n  |         ^^\n```\nPerhaps with a `=help` \"did you mean to use a character literal?\" when applicable\n\n\n\n### Rationale and extra context\n\nI feel the rationale is self-explanatory, however, if it ends up not being such, I can provide one upon request.\n\n### Other cases\n\n\nsmall aside: I originally wrote this all for `\ud83e\udd7a`, but that is bizarrely not recognized in idents at all (it gives a `error: unknown start of token: \\u{1f97a}`), and after realizing that some emotes are handled better, I decided to use to use `\ud83d\udc31`. I specifically avoided `\ud83e\udd80` because it has extra-special handling (\"Ferris cannot be used as an identifier\")\n\nAnother case is, as mentioned prior, in lifetime names (as far as I'm aware, this is the same underlying cause: the emoji causes the token to be a character literal):\n\n```Rust\nfn foo<'\ud83d\udc31>() -> &'\ud83d\udc31 () {\n   &()\n}\n```\nwhich gives 2 errors:\n```\nerror: character literal may only contain one codepoint\n --> src/lib.rs:1:8\n  |\n1 | fn foo<'\ud83d\udc31>() -> &'\ud83d\udc31 () {\n  |        ^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  |\nhelp: if you meant to write a `str` literal, use double quotes\n  |\n1 | fn foo<\"\ud83d\udc31>() -> &\"\ud83d\udc31 () {\n  |        ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nerror: expected one of `#`, `>`, `const`, identifier, or lifetime, found `'\ud83d\udc31>() -> &'`\n --> src/lib.rs:1:8\n  |\n1 | fn foo<'\ud83d\udc31>() -> &'\ud83d\udc31 () {\n  |        ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected one of `#`, `>`, `const`, identifier, or lifetime\n```\nThe following sample also has very different output (and probably closer to the expected output, although it's not without its own weirdness):\n```\nfn bar() {\n    'a\ud83d\udc31: loop {}\n}\n```\n```\nerror: malformed loop label\n --> src/lib.rs:6:7\n  |\n6 |     'a\ud83d\udc31: loop {}\n  |       ^^ help: use the correct loop label format: `'\ud83d\udc31`\n\nerror: expected `while`, `for`, `loop` or `{` after a label\n --> src/lib.rs:6:7\n  |\n6 |     'a\ud83d\udc31: loop {}\n  |       ^^ expected `while`, `for`, `loop` or `{` after a label\n  |\nhelp: consider removing the label\n  |\n6 -     'a\ud83d\udc31: loop {}\n6 +     \ud83d\udc31: loop {}\n  |\n\nerror: labeled expression must be followed by `:`\n --> src/lib.rs:6:7\n  |\n6 |     'a\ud83d\udc31: loop {}\n  |     ---^^^^^^^^^^\n  |     | |\n  |     | help: add `:` after the label\n  |     the label\n  |\n  = note: labels are used before loops and blocks, allowing e.g., `break 'label` to them\n\nerror: identifiers cannot contain emoji: `\ud83d\udc31`\n --> src/lib.rs:6:7\n  |\n6 |     'a\ud83d\udc31: loop {}\n  |       ^^\n\nwarning: unused label\n --> src/lib.rs:6:7\n  |\n6 |     'a\ud83d\udc31: loop {}\n  |       ^^\n  |\n  = note: `#[warn(unused_labels)]` on by default\n\nwarning: `playground` (lib) generated 1 warning\nerror: could not compile `playground` due to 4 previous errors; 1 warning emitted\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"jieyouxu\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108019/reactions", "total_count": 9, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 8, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108019/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
