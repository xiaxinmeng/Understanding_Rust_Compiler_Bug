It was partially inspired by previous issues brought up in this repo, including https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/19221 and\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/956#issuecomment-78504506.\n\nOur project is currently focusing on rewriting and documenting Grailsort, with the hopes of making the algorithm much more readable and intuitive.\n\nI was curious if there's still interest in implementing an in-place sort like this for Rust, especially because one of our contributors is maintaining a WIP Rust version of said rewrite in our repo.\n\nhttps://github.com/MusicTheorist/Rewritten-Grailsort\n\nFeel free to let us know what your thoughts are.
