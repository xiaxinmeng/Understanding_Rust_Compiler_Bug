This blocks our goals to [migrate entirely over to unit tests](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44844). We should fix it!\r\n\r\nI imagine it working like this:\r\n\r\n- For each test T with revisions R1..Rn, we would expect N stderr files:\r\n  - `T.Ri.stderr`, where `Ri` is the current revision\r\n- Comments on lines work as normal (`//[Ri]~ ERROR`)\r\n\r\nHowever, it might be useful to permit tests to have a \"fallback\" `T.stderr` file, in which case the output is supposed to be the same for all revisions.  I am of mixed minds about this though: I don't know how often it would be useful, and I fear \"dead stderr files\" that are not used.
