Presumably the same thing would occur for a user who has sensibly disabled cookies in their web browser, resulting in the same horrible \"stupid popup\" user experience.\r\n\r\nGiven that without web local storage it is not possible to make a thing that is shown to each user once, it would be better not to show this popup at all when local storage is not available.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it is possible to determine easily whether local storage is available.  I think there may be browsers which silently discard local storage writes rather than explicitly saying it's not available.  Until we know the answer to this question, I suggest that the new popup should be disabled :-(.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79960/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79960/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
