We can probably live with warnings not being surfaced if there's some bigger picture around the change. I may also be totally off in the weeds on this.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** The change was somewhere between 12ed235ad and 6a1c0637c", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53209/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53209/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
