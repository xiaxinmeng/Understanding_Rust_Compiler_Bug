In particular, I don't like the idea of the compiler magically inserting code around block calls to handle non-local returns.  Therefore, I am throwing out this half-way scheme to see what people think.  It does not allow `ret` within blocks but it does allow `break` and `cont` and involves relatively little magic.\n\nThe idea is to create a \"well-known\" enum in the core library:\n\n```\nenum loop_ctl {\n    lc_break,\n    lc_cont\n}\n```\n\nWithin a sugared closure, `break` and `cont` would be equivalent to `ret lc_break` and `ret lc_cont`.  Next, if there is no existing tail expression in the sugared closure _and_ the expected return type is `loop_ctl`, the tail expression `lc_cont` is added by default.  Finally, we disallow explicit use of `ret` within sugared closures all together, because it is potentially confusing and (besides) hurts our current type inference.\n\nThe final condition is not needed.  We could keep `ret` with the current meaning of \"return from the closure early\" and just fix up the type inference algorithm.  I am somewhat indifferent but I do think it's mildly confusing, particularly if `break` and `cont` start to work.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1619/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1619/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
