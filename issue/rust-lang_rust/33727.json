It might be a good idea to treat them just like HIR or Metadata nodes and thus make them part of the regular dep-graph.\n\n`cfg` settings are a special case. Since they will affect the HIR being generated, they need not be considered for incr. comp. However, it might make sense to have separate caches for different sets of `cfg` flags, iff we want to support these being changed frequently without having to recompile a lot. Although that might be a negligible use case.\n\nA first step to implementing this is probably taking a survey of all command line options and seeing what they might affect.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "michaelwoerister", "id": 1825894, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjU4OTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1825894?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister", "html_url": "https://github.com/michaelwoerister", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33727/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33727/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
