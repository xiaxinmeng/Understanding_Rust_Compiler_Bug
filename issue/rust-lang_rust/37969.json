This regression in required libraries was introduced by https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/3272 and was later fixed by https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/3311 and https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/3315.\r\n\r\nBeta's Cargo date is 2016-11-16, corresponding to rust-lang/cargo@a9c23dd and includes rust-lang/cargo#3272. The previous nightly, 2016-11-15, corresponds to rust-lang/cargo@9f1beaf which also includes rust-lang/cargo#3272. The previous *successful* nightly was 2016-11-09 which corresponds to rust-lang/cargo@5b5684e. Unfortunately that nightly does not contain https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/3280 which is required for beta to bootstrap with rustbuild.\r\n\r\nSo we've got a few options:\r\n\r\n* Fast forward the Cargo nightly by a few weeks. We'd have to fixup version numbers with new commits.\r\n* Start release branches of Cargo *now* with the support from https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/3239\r\n* Prepare a custom branch of Cargo and upload a new nightly for some previous date manually (somehow).\r\n\r\nMy preference is to go with https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/3239. @brson what do you think?", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37969/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37969/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
