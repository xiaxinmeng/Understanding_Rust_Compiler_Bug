But some situations (like \"name is not defined or in scope\") can't possibly know how to correctly fix the issue. I suggest to add another diagnostic called \"guess\" (the bikeshed may be of any colour).\n\nThe regular text-report won't be changed (so `guess` shows up as `help` like it does right now). But the json output would contain the guesses for processing by IDEs and tools like [rustfix](https://github.com/killercup/rustfix).\n\nThis way, suggestions can be automatically applied and guesses require user interaction to apply them.\n\nThe [json diagnostic structs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/91f34c0c70746f5c938d25d02a8a66b41240b2f0/src/libsyntax/json.rs#L93) will be extended this way:\n\n``` rust\n    /// A list of code snippets that could be used to replace the span,\n    /// but may contain wrong suggestions. The user needs to take care\n    /// to select the correct one or even ignore all of them.\n    guesses: Vec<String>,\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "oli-obk", "id": 332036, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAzNg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332036?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk", "html_url": "https://github.com/oli-obk", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37085/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37085/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
