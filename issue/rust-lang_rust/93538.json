There's a similar issue where the browser will break `&[T]` between the `&` and the `[`. We should use the same trick there to prevent breaking.\r\n\r\nAlso, the browser will _never_ consider a parenthesis wedged between two words to be a word break opportunity. For instance, in `fn foo(bar: Baz)`, the browser will never break between `(` and `bar`. That's actually one of our optimal break locations; it's where rustfmt would break the word. We can tell the browser that's an available option by inserting a `<wbr>` tag.\r\n\r\nAlso, when we do have to break up a signature, we'd prefer to keep each parameter name on the same line as its type if possible (again, mimicking rustfmt style). We can achieve this by inserting an `&nbsp;` between parameter names and types. For instance `bar:&nbsp;Baz`. We should also use `&nbsp;` as the space between `mut` and `Bar` in `&mut Bar`. Note that this may be a little hard because that space is added by print_with_space, and the output of print_with_space is used in both HTML and non-HTML contexts.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93538/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93538/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
