I tried looking to see if there was already an open issue related to this, but I couldn't find anything.\r\n\r\nBeing a long-time C# programmer, I have a lot of code written in C# that I've transcribed to Rust. Attributes are a language feature that C# and Rust share in common, yet I've always found Rust's syntax for declaring attributes to be clunky and limiting.\r\n\r\nConsider the following Rust code:\r\n```Rust\r\n#[repr(C)]\r\n#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]\r\npub struct Point2D {\r\n  pub x: f32,\r\n  pub y: f32\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I were to write that same code in C# syntax, it would look somewhat like this pseudocode:\r\n```Csharp\r\n[Repr(C)]\r\n[Derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]\r\npublic struct Point2D\r\n{\r\n    public float X;\r\n    public float Y;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, C# allows you to condense attributes into a single pair of square brackets, like so:\r\n```Csharp\r\n[Repr(C), Derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows us to save a line of text, and removes some noise from the screen. I wrote this issue because I wanted to propose that Rust should implement a similar setup for attribute declaration, making both of the following be valid syntax and having the same effect on code:\r\n```Rust\r\n#[repr(C)]\r\n#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]\r\npub struct A;\r\n\r\n#[repr(C), derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]\r\npub struct A;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this was brought up in the past and declined, I apologize. Thank you for taking the time to check this out.", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53061/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53061/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
