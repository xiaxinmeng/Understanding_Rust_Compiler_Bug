We ought to ensure that the tools are not forgotten at least on all tier-1 platforms.\r\n\r\nThe simplest fix right now is to add a check that if a tool failed to build, the whole dist job should be aborted. Currently we *allowed* tool dist to fail because of this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e7b5ba8661aa844a06c37f22d7af0afb1807d347/src/bootstrap/dist.rs#L1166-L1169\r\n\r\nsimilar for Clippy:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e7b5ba8661aa844a06c37f22d7af0afb1807d347/src/bootstrap/dist.rs#L1245-L1252\r\n\r\nand rustfmt:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e7b5ba8661aa844a06c37f22d7af0afb1807d347/src/bootstrap/dist.rs#L1323-L1331\r\n\r\nWhat we should do is modify the `or_else` branch to `panic!` unless we are configured to allow omitting these tools (i.e. in the nightly channel). (Consider refactor this into the same function to avoid writing the same thing 5 times.)\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to check the release channel directly inside rustbuild, I consider this a bad coupling. It is better to add a configuration variable `--enable-missing-tools`, and modify `src/ci/run.sh` to pass this into `$RUST_CONFIGURE_ARGS` when \r\n\r\n1. `$RUST_RELEASE_CHANNEL = \"nightly\"`, or\r\n2. the env var `$DIST_REQUIRE_ALL_TOOLS` is undefined\r\n\r\nYou may see #39824 for how to add a config to rustbuild.\r\n\r\nAfter this issue is fixed, we'll ensure RLS/Clippy/Rustfmt will be present on all tier-1 platforms on beta/stable. In the future we should record and alert the tool developers when they fail to build on nightly or lower-tier platforms, but let's get the immediate issue fixed first...", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54483/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54483/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
