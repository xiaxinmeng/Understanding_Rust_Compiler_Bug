That is, given a function `fn(T)`, it can infer the type of T based on its usage. Const-generics also has limited support for inference, such as for arrays, we can infer `N: usize` in some usages `[T; N]`. In order to expand inference for consts, it's necessary to lift the current specialized type `Ty::Infer` into `GenericArg::Infer`, as `GenericArg` covers both consts and types, whereas `Ty::Infer` can only be used in the place of types. This will eventually allow for consts to be inferred in all the same locations as types.\r\n\r\n### About tracking issues\r\n\r\nTracking issues are used to record the overall progress of implementation.\r\nThey are also used as hubs connecting to other relevant issues, e.g., bugs or open design questions.\r\nA tracking issue is however *not* meant for large scale discussion, questions, or bug reports about a feature.\r\nInstead, open a dedicated issue for the specific matter and add the relevant feature gate label.\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n<!--\r\nInclude each step required to complete the feature. Typically this is a PR\r\nimplementing a feature, followed by a PR that stabilises the feature. However\r\nfor larger features an implementation could be broken up into multiple PRs.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implement the RFC (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83484)\r\n- [ ] Solve #112110\r\n- [ ] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][doc-guide])\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][stabilization-guide])\r\n\r\n[stabilization-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr\r\n[doc-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#documentation-prs\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nShould `hir::Ty::Infer` be removed?\r\n\r\n### Implementation history\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a list of all the PRs that were involved in implementing the feature.\r\n-->\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85077/reactions", "total_count": 27, "+1": 23, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 4, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85077/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
