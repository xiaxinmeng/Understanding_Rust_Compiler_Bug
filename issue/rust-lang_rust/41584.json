The message however only comes up when stack frames are omitted [See here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/9f2abadca2d065bf81772cb84981d0a22d8e98b3/src/libstd/sys_common/backtrace.rs#L74). This used to be the case for the shortened backtrace, but since the frame pruning logic got reverted by #41364, this message is now dead code until frame pruning is implemented again (#40264). However it might also make sense to just always show this message for a short backtrace instead of counting the amount of omitted frames.", "closed_by": {"login": "CryZe", "id": 1451630, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTE2MzA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1451630?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/CryZe", "html_url": "https://github.com/CryZe", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CryZe/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CryZe/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CryZe/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CryZe/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CryZe/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CryZe/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CryZe/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CryZe/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CryZe/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/41584/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/41584/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
