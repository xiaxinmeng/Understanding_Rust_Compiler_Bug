This makes it difficult to select the right CRT for certain builds. This matters particularly when integrating Rust alongside existing C/C++ build systems. The same CRT must be used in all cases.\r\n\r\nI would propose that `rustc` should behave more like `cl` (the MSVC compiler) in this case. We should use [`/DEFAULTLIB:`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/defaultlib-specify-default-library?view=msvc-170) to link the CRT so the library is overridable rather than hard coded. This also means it can work with existing tools rather than needing anything custom for `rustc`.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/107570/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/107570/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
