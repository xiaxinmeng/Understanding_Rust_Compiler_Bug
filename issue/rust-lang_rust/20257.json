I am _pretty confident_ that this reasoning no longer applies, especially now that we have `Sync`.  The reason this is safe is that `Arc<T>` will not be `Send` unless `T` is, and if you try to pass `Arc<T>` into `spawn()` without `Send` it won't work anyway.\n\n(Making `Arc<T>` only `Send` sometimes may not have been doable prior to unsafe traits, so this issue may have depended on #20119 being resolved.  But I think the way `Arc` is defined this isn't true).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "aturon", "id": 709807, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTgwNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/709807?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon", "html_url": "https://github.com/aturon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20257/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20257/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
