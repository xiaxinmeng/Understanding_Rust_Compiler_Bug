Today we require exactly one non-ZST field in a `repr(transparent)` struct\r\n * It would replace the predicate \"ZST/non-ZST\" with \"occupies/does-not-occupy memory\" -- the distinction there being that a ZST with alignment > 1 can cause padding to be injected, and thus memory to be allocated.\r\n\r\nHat tip to @RalfJung for pointing this oddity out as part of PR #99972", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100954/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100954/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
