Searching rustdoc for \"replace\" did not yield any result. After 5 minutes of looking around I finally found it after using the \"[src]\" link of the `std::str` docs and employing `Ctrl+F` to search the source. Only when I noticed that the method was defined on the primitive str type, did I remember that primitives are documented separately.\n\nI already have experience in navigating rustdoc, but it still took me a considerable amount of time to find what I was looking for. The topic of hard to find documentation on strings was already the subject #22902, which resulted in two tiny links being added to the docs of `std::str`.\n\nI think at the very least `std::str` should **prominently** link to the str primitive, mentioning specifically that _additional methods are documented there_.\n\nEven better in my opinion would be if primitives and their methods could be found using rustdoc's search, maybe under a pseudo module (ie. `primitive::str::replace`).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "TimNN", "id": 1178249, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjExNzgyNDk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1178249?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/TimNN", "html_url": "https://github.com/TimNN", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TimNN/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TimNN/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TimNN/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TimNN/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TimNN/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TimNN/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TimNN/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TimNN/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TimNN/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/23709/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/23709/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
