Expected a file with either of these names to be created and it's contents to be \"test\". Or, to receive an error if the write or flush fail.\r\n\r\nInstead, this happened: A file named \"ok\" was created. It was empty even though neither of the unwraps failed.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n<!--\r\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\r\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.65.0 (897e37553 2022-11-02)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 897e37553bba8b42751c67658967889d11ecd120\r\ncommit-date: 2022-11-02\r\nhost: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\r\nrelease: 1.65.0\r\nLLVM version: 15.0.0\r\n```\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108409/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108409/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
