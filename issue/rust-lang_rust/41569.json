Over time though it's unfortunately really showing its age as it's become more and more difficult to maintain over time. With rustbuild nowadays let's take this opportunity to rewrite it into Rust!\r\n\r\nThis transition would most likely look like:\r\n\r\n* Add a new tool, `src/tools/installer`\r\n* Add appropriate crates.io dependencies to `src/tools/installer/Cargo.toml`\r\n* Reimplement the installer in Rust, including various commands and scripts.\r\n* Replace all calls in [`dist.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/036983201d4e9aeb5c5e56e47c305971972b2569/src/bootstrap/dist.rs) to `rust-installer/*.sh` to calls into this new project. For an example of invoking a tool written in Rust, you can see how we [call `cargotest`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/036983201d4e9aeb5c5e56e47c305971972b2569/src/bootstrap/check.rs#L88-L93)\r\n\r\nThis'd be a great opportunity for anyone looking to get their feet wet with Rust's distribution infrastructure and build system! It's also a relatively meaty project to boot :)", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/41569/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/41569/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
