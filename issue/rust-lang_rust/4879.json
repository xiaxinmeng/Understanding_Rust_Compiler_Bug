These types of casts don't happen for things like function parameters, however.\n\nIs there a reason for these implicit casts to not work in other use cases and only work in the method-call `self` use case? An example is:\n\n```\nstruct Foo { f: int }\n\nimpl Foo {\n  fn bar(&self) {}\n}\n\nfn foo(_: &Foo) {\n}\n\nfn main() {\n  let s : &~Foo = &~Foo{ f: 2 };\n  s.bar(); // ok, cast to '&Foo' happens\n  foo(s);  // error: mismatched types: expected `&Foo` but found `&~Foo`\n}\n```\n\nPersonally, I think that this would make code more readable in that you wouldn't need as many explicit `*` operators all over the place. This mainly comes up when there's an owned pointer in an enum variant, and I'm just iterating over the enum to do some processing. I have a function which takes `&Enum`, and then each variant captures via `ref var`, creating `&~` pointers which then must be recursed on with `*var`.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "catamorphism", "id": 427212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzIxMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/427212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism", "html_url": "https://github.com/catamorphism", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4879/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4879/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
