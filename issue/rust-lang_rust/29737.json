But one of the strategies means that code files can't be moved around without touching it inside the files. And the other one, putting the crate imports in the root, means that besides putting things in the cargo.toml and at the site of use, we are putting things in a file that should not know so much about so many things.\n\nmain.rs does need to \"point to\" xml_usecase.rs but it isn't very fluid to have to have xml_usecase.rs contain so much modification to its boiler-plate compared to how it looked when it cohabited with main.rs.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "emberian", "id": 704250, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDI1MA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/704250?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian", "html_url": "https://github.com/emberian", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29737/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29737/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
