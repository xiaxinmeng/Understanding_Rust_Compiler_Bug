Make sure that the file wasn't corrupted in transit by accident with something like a faulty proxy.\n2. Make sure the file itself wasn't tampered with.\n\nTo accomplish this let's do two things:\n- Check into the compiler Rust source the sha256 of what we _should_ be downloading.\n- Check the sha256 of what we just downloaded against this value.\n\nUnfortunately we can't do this in Rust just yet, we'll have to do it in Python or shell out to some system utility. If you've got some Python chops or would like to write a little python, should be a pretty easy bug to get started! \n\nAll downloads currently happen in `src/bootstrap/bootstrap.py`, so this'll just be modifying the relevant pieces there.
