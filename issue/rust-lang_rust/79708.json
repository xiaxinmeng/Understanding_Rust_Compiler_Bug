There was no unsafe code anywhere near the calling site, so this was unexpected. When analyzed it turned out to be an invalid stack access in the generated code. Unfortunately we could not reduce this to a compact reproducer. So far as we know there's only one instance of this bug affecting generated code in our codebase, but we haven't yet eliminated the possibility of a non-faulting manifestation.  Using new-pass-manager eliminates the problem in this case.\r\n\r\nIt turned out to be a bug with llvm's alias analysis. Upstream proposed fix and discsussion: https://reviews.llvm.org/D91576\r\n\r\nI'm filing this mostly as a heads up to wg-llvm to make sure that once the fix has landed in llvm it gets picked up in the next Rust release.\r\n\r\ncc @mjhostet, @dtolnay \r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n<!--\r\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\r\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.47.0-dev\r\nLLVM Version: 9.0\r\n```\r\nWe are building this against an in-house version of llvm 9.0 with some local modifications.
