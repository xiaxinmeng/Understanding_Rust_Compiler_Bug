Thank you!\r\n\r\nSo, here I am, although this may very well be a layer 8 problem.\r\n\r\nWhat I did: I checked out conrod and first migrated `conrod_derive` via \r\n\r\n`cargo fix --edition`\r\n\r\nBut it turned out to be quite tedious until I found out about:\r\n\r\n`cargo fix --prepare-for 2018` (any reason this is not more prominently mentioned in the guide?)\r\n\r\nThen all the low hanging fruits were done automagically - great! (My compliments/gratitude here!)\r\n\r\nI then proceeded enabling `edition = 2018` in the `Cargo.toml` file and then the nightmare started:\r\n\r\n> error[E0412]: cannot find type `Theme` in the crate root                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \r\n  --> src/widget/toggle.rs:38:50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \r\n   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \r\n38 | #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Default, PartialEq, WidgetStyle_)]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \r\n   |                                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^ not found in the crate root                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\nhelp: possible candidate is found in another module, you can import it into scope                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \r\n   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \r\n3  | use crate::theme::Theme;        \r\n\r\nAppears a few dozen times for different files!
