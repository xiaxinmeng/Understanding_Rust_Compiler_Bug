It's hard to motivate why Boxes are useful and a good abstraction without having a clear picture of ownership and movement. I think it would make sense to move the section on Boxes from Pointers into Ownership.\n\nRelatedly, I think my mental model on ownership, movement, and borrowing became a lot clearer when I started with ownership, Boxes, and movement, then motivated why borrowing was useful and how to borrow safely\u2014aka, explain buying from a store, then borrowing from a library, rather than starting with borrowing and going backwards to ownership. I can see why it makes sense to introduce references first as they're lighter weight.\n\nJust my two cents!\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24019/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24019/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
