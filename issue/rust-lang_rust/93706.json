The feature gate for the issue is `#![feature(const_fn_trait_bound)]`. This is not to be confused with the \"trait impl must be `const` in const contexts\" syntax, `~const Trait`, which is a part of `const_trait_impl` and is tracked in #67792.\r\n\r\n### About tracking issues\r\n\r\nTracking issues are used to record the overall progress of implementation.\r\nThey are also used as hubs connecting to other relevant issues, e.g., bugs or open design questions.\r\nA tracking issue is however *not* meant for large scale discussion, questions, or bug reports about a feature.\r\nInstead, open a dedicated issue for the specific matter and add the relevant feature gate label.\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n<!--\r\nInclude each step required to complete the feature. Typically this is a PR\r\nimplementing a feature, followed by a PR that stabilises the feature. However\r\nfor larger features an implementation could be broken up into multiple PRs.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [X] Implement the feature (couldn't find the implementation PR; `const_fn_trait_bound` was split from `const_fn` in #84310)\r\n- [x] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][doc-guide]) rust-lang/reference#1166\r\n- [x] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][stabilization-guide]) #93827\r\n\r\n[stabilization-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr\r\n[doc-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#documentation-prs\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n * https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/90912\r\n\r\n### Implementation history\r\n* #????? - Implementation\r\n* #84310 - Split `const_fn_trait_bound` into its own feature gate\r\n\r\n@rustbot modify labels +A-const-fn +A-traits", "closed_by": {"login": "oli-obk", "id": 332036, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAzNg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332036?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk", "html_url": "https://github.com/oli-obk", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93706/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93706/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
