I would like to propose something a bit different, so please hear me out.\r\n\r\nI propose that instead of aliasing `var` to `let mut`, we instead just make `mut` expand into `let mut` when in the context of a variable declaration. For example:\r\n```Rust\r\nlet mut foo = 12;\r\n// is identical to\r\nmut foo = 12;\r\n```\r\nThis solves the problems (readability, more concise) that people have with `let mut`, whilst not causing the issues that people have (pattern matching and consistancy).\r\n\r\nThe most common issue people have with aliasing `var` to `let mut` is that it doesn't fit well with patterns, like `let (x, mut y) = ...`. However, `mut` gets rid of this problem, because you wouldn't write `let mut (x, mut y)` if you were trying to pattern match, so why would someone want to write `mut (x, mut y)`? You wouldn't do that, and it wouldn't compile.\r\n\r\nThis would be optional, of course. `let mut x = 1` would still work fine, and people would just have to option of removing the `let` to let it be implied.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of other abbreviations used in rust (`fn`, `mod`, `pub`) that all serve the purpose of writing less. It just doesn't feel right that one of the most commonly used keywords is so long.\r\n\r\n:heart::crab:\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"chocol4te\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/65257/reactions", "total_count": 36, "+1": 3, "-1": 32, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/65257/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
