This way, it become possible to share variable between multiple blocks. It think it would be useful when:\r\n\r\n- you have something long (and boring) to set-up, like a small graph, and want re-use it.\r\n\r\n``` rust\r\n/// Common setup:\r\n/// ```\r\n/// use ...\r\n/// let graph = create_graph();\r\n/// let a = graph.add_node();\r\n/// let b = graph.add_node();\r\n/// let c = graph.add_node();\r\n/// ```\r\n/// First use-case:\r\n/// ```\r\n/// foo(graph, a, true);\r\n/// ```\r\n/// Second use-case:\r\n/// ```\r\n/// foo(graph, b, false);\r\n/// ```\r\npub fn foo(graph: G, node: G::node, b: bool);\r\n```\r\n\r\n- you have a multi-part algorithm, and you want to use regular text instead of comments to explain it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n//// First create a foo\r\n/// ```\r\n/// let foo = create_foo()\r\n/// ```\r\n/// Then pass it to bar, with a frob transformation:\r\n/// ```\r\n/// bar(foo, add_frob())\r\n/// ```\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI see two possible solution.\r\n\r\n- Either all snippet documenting a single item would share the same scope automatically. It requires no modification from the user (and would be the easier to use. But I don't know if it can break existing tests (due to the `?` operator most probably).\r\n- Or manually, with an annotation after the ` ``` `, For example ` ```extend_scope`.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\nI am not fully certain that this feature request should be done here, or in rustc itself.
