Anyways, consequently, we've had a bunch of regressions, one of which was performance-related and I was bisecting it. The first thing I did was to compare each rust release, and it turned out the regression started between 1.44 and 1.45. So I went to the 1.45 release notes suspecting LLVM could have been involved and saw nothing there.\r\nNow, several hours later bisecting through nightlies (because PGO and LTO being involved, testing one version takes a while), the regression appears to have started between\r\n  rustc 1.45.0-nightly (9310e3bd4 2020-05-21)\r\nand\r\n  rustc 1.45.0-nightly (0aa6751c1 2020-05-20)\r\n\r\nSo I take my git, type `git log 0aa6751c1..9310e3bd4 --author=bors --oneline` and lo and behold, there it is:\r\n```\r\n9310e3bd4f4 Auto merge of #71930 - Nadrieril:exhaustiveness-remove-tyerr, r=varkor\r\n148c125b1bf Auto merge of #71718 - NeoRaider:ffi_const_pure, r=Amanieu\r\n06c9fef822b Auto merge of #72422 - RalfJung:rollup-u81z4mw, r=RalfJung\r\n7f79e98c035 Auto merge of #72205 - ecstatic-morse:nrvo, r=oli-obk\r\n963bf528292 Auto merge of #70705 - lcnr:generic_discriminant, r=nikomatsakis\r\n82911b3bba7 Auto merge of #67759 - nikic:llvm-10, r=Mark-Simulacrum\r\n```\r\nI'm still waiting on the results actually confirming LLVM is involved (it likely is), but it would have saved me a lot of time if the LLVM upgrade had been mentioned (which it is for LLVM 11 in 1.47, BTW, but OTOH, now that I look, it appears the last upgrade mentioned is to LLVM 6 in 1.25...)", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/78464/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/78464/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
