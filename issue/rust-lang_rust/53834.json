"body": "We intend for `await` to be a keyword in the 2018 edition, this causes a tricky problem: currently, `await!` is a macro, not using \"normal\" control flow syntax, because we haven't decided exactly how the syntax should work (see the RFC unresolved questions for more context). But macros are not supposed to be able to have keywords as names.\r\n\r\nIt's now the case that not only does std have an `await!` macro, but other libraries are defining them also to handle compatibility between different versions of futures, specifically [tokio-async-await](https://crates.io/crates/tokio-async-await).\r\n\r\nI propose this solution to the problem:\r\n\r\n1. On 2018, `await` is a true keyword - a macro named `await` would be invalid.\r\n2. Under the `await_macro` feature, the `await` keyword is disabled, allowing users (including std) to use `await` as a macro name.\r\n3. Before we stabilize async/await, we resolve the syntactic question for `await` and make `await` a keyword again. This will break anyone using `await` as a macro name, but they were already on nightly, and expected this breakage.\r\n\r\nThis avoids special casing std `await!`, making the behavior on stable for 2018 simple and allowing tokio-async-await to keep its `await!` macro.\r\n\r\ncc @carllerche @centril @cramertj", "closed_by": {"login": "pnkfelix", "id": 173127, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173127?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix", "html_url": "https://github.com/pnkfelix", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53834/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53834/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
