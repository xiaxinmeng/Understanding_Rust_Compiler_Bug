E.g. a sample of the code in visit.rs:\n\n``` rust\n    fn visit_item(&mut self, i:@item, e:E) { walk_item(self, i, e) }\n    fn visit_local(&mut self, l:@Local, e:E) { walk_local(self, l, e) }\n    fn visit_block(&mut self, b:&Block, e:E) { walk_block(self, b, e) }\n```\n\nbut there are exceptions, and one of them is `visit_ty`:\n\n``` rust\n    fn visit_ty(&mut self, _t:&Ty, _e:E) { }\n```\n\nI deliberately made that function a no-op when I introduced the Visitor refactoring (#7081), because I was attempting to do a pure refactoring of the existing record-of-closures syntax visitor, which _also_ skipped traversing types by default, see e.g. [oldvisit.rs](../blob/ef854c9b04cf916241587ea1764b86027e380e8f/src/libsyntax/oldvisit.rs#L111).\n\n@jbclements recently asked why we do this, and I do not have an answer.  At first I thought \"well maybe we want to force people to opt-into traversing over type structure, since in the common case you'll only want to look at value-producing expressions in many visitors.\"  The problem with that logic is that we do allow some expressions within a type expression (namely const expressions, such as within the bounds of a fixed-length vector type), and thus if you want to traverse _all_ of the subexpressions, you still need to traverse the types.\n\nOne tricky side of this is that I think in my early attempts at the visit.rs refactoring, I did attempt to include ty-traversal as the visit_ty default, and this led to some sort of errors.  (i don't recall what sort of errors; all I remember is eventually narrowing the problem down to the visit_ty implementation, and at that point I threw my hands up.)\n\nBut even so, we can easily change all of the existing visitor implementations that don't override the default visit_ty to now override it with a no-op.  That would trivially lead the way to making visit_ty call walk_ty, which might be a better default behavior for future visitor code.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10108/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10108/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
