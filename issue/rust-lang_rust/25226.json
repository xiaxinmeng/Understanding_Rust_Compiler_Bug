It would be better if, instead of generating `std/collections/struct.HashMap.html`, rustdoc generated `std/collections/HashMap`. This would enable anyone who knows the website at which the documentation for their library is stored and the namespace object they wish to look up to navigate to this page with ease.  Similarly, methods should probably drop the `method.` prefix, and be found such as `std/collections/HashMap#contains_key`.\n\nThe `.html` affix conveys no useful information at all, and the `struct.` prefix conveys information which is not helpful for disambiguating this page from other pages in the documentation hierarchy.\n\nThe exception to this seems to be the strange `std/primitive.char.html` pages. I don't exactly know how these are generated, and they are difficult to locate already in the documentation generated by rustdoc; at very least these should be at `std/primitive.char`, without the `.html`.\n\nIf this change is considered valuable, it seems somewhat high priority to limit the number of links that will exist to current page schemes as Rust continues to gain momentum post-1.0\n\nAs an addendum, I want to say that rustdoc is the best doc system of any language I've used and an incredible, bountiful asset to Rust.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nrc", "id": 762626, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjYyNg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/762626?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc", "html_url": "https://github.com/nrc", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nrc/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25226/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25226/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
