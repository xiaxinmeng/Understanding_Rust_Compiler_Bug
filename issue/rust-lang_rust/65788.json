So, here it is.  This is not a terribly *minimal* reproduction, unfortunately, but hopefully it's still useful for someone.\r\n\r\nBasically, the flame graph produced from the results of `measureme`'s `stack_collapse` seem to have a big pile of missing stuff, and so look like this: https://alopex.li/data/images/ggraphics_flame.svg with nearly 50% of the time unaccounted for.  The thing I was building was this project:  https://github.com/ggez/ggraphics/ commit aacc2ac152c42c4289559076066f2ffe4745f775 .  This *seems* like an output bug of some kind or another, since the chart produced by `summarize` has more like 90+% of the time listed in the first few rows, which I didn't realize at the time.\r\n\r\nJust let me know if you need anything else!", "closed_by": {"login": "wesleywiser", "id": 831192, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjgzMTE5Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/831192?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser", "html_url": "https://github.com/wesleywiser", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wesleywiser/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/65788/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/65788/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
