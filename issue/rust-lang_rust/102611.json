If so, I still think the failure coulld use a better error message.\n\nIn short, the following code fails to compile:\n```rust\npub struct Foo<'a, A>(&'a A);\n\nimpl<'a, A> Foo<'a, A> {\n    pub fn foo() {}\n    \n    pub fn call_foo() {\n        Self::foo();\n    }\n}\n```\n([playground link](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=8c6adca96101697aaee5c75621a35eb4))\n\nError message:\n```\nerror[E0309]: the parameter type `A` may not live long enough\n --> src/lib.rs:7:9\n  |\n7 |         Self::foo();\n  |         ^^^^^^^^^ ...so that the type `A` will meet its required lifetime bounds\n  |\nhelp: consider adding an explicit lifetime bound...\n  |\n3 | impl<'a, A: 'a> Foo<'a, A> {\n  |           ++++\n```\n\nIn `call_foo`, the compiler (correctly) requires that `A: 'a`, but fails to realize that this bound is already satisfied (because this is also required for callers of `call_foo`).\n\nTo me, this seems like a bug. However, this behavior seems to have been present in stable for long enough that it seems highly unlikely it hasn't already been discussed at length - I couldn't find any issues referencing it though. (closest seems to be #84021).\n\nHappy to help where I can (would need some direction).\n\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"lcnr\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/102611/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/102611/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
