This is true.\r\n\r\nIt then points you to the [compiler_builtins_lib](https://doc.rust-lang.org/unstable-book/library-features/compiler-builtins-lib.html) feature as the way to access that crate. This is apparently wrong, because `rustc 1.42.0-nightly (9ed29b6ff 2020-01-29)` claims that there is no such feature at all.\r\n\r\nHowever, the readme for the `compiler_builtins` crate [tells you how and when to use the crate](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-builtins#when-and-how-to-use-this-crate). It says to just add the git link and an `extern crate compiler_builtins;` and no lang feature. On Linux x86_64 GNU (but not MUSL) this seems to work, though it's easy to also then get [multiple definition errors](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-builtins/issues/336), and that seems to be fixed by setting `codegen-units=1`.\r\n\r\nAnyway there's no `compiler_builtins_lib` feature so that page should probably go away.", "closed_by": {"login": "Lokathor", "id": 5456384, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTYzODQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5456384?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Lokathor", "html_url": "https://github.com/Lokathor", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Lokathor/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Lokathor/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Lokathor/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Lokathor/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Lokathor/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Lokathor/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Lokathor/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Lokathor/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Lokathor/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69177/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69177/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
