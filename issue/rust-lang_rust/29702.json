What is the behavior of `transmute::<T, T>(foo)` when `T` is not `repr(C)`? A strict reading of the current text indicates that it is undefined.\n2. If a struct (tuple or otherwise) contains only a single field and that field is `repr(C)`, is it safe to transmute to and from it? I assume the answer is no, for simplicity and future compiler optimizations and security features.\n3. If a struct is declared `repr(C)` but contains fields that are not `repr(C)`, what is the behavior of transmuting to and from it? I assume it is undefined, which means that the proposed lint needs to recursively examine fields for their `repr(C)`-ness.\n\nCC @Gankro.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29702/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29702/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
