The current code is no as smart as it could be: for example, if we test and find that a value equals 'c', we ought to be able to rule out that the character also equals 'd'. But, because the test tells us nothing if we find that the character is NOT equal to 'c', we take the simple path right now and say that an equality test against 'c' and an equality test against 'd' are completely orthogonal from one another. Similar limitations exist for range tests, slice length tests, etc. We should do better!\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29623/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29623/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
