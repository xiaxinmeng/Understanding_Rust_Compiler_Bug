It seems like the following steps must be taken in the following order, otherwise bad things happen.\r\n\r\n0. `cargo +nightly install cargo-fix`\r\n1. Add `#![feature(rust_2018_preview)]` to *every* target.\r\n2. Run `cargo +nightly fix --prepare-for 2018 --allow-dirty -- --all-targets`\r\n3. Add `cargo-features = [\"edition\"]` and `edition = \"2018\"` to Cargo.toml.\r\n\r\nIt's not entirely clear to me the relationship between step 1 and 3.  I can't do step 3 first, otherwise `cargo fix` will fail.  However, after doing step 3, I can remove the `rust_2018_preview` attribute?  \r\nAlso, I can't run step 2 first, otherwise it doesn't do anything.\r\n\r\nAm I understanding it correctly?  The process seemed a little confusing and took some trial and error to figure out the correct steps.  \r\n\r\nI also don't know what `cargo +nightly fix` by itself (without the prepare flag) is intended for.  I can't find a scenario where it actually does something, other than finish without changes or error out (because the code still has 2015 syntax).\r\n\r\nUsing `rustc 1.29.0-nightly (e06c87544 2018-07-06)` and `cargo-fix 0.4.1`\r\n\r\ncc @Mark-Simulacrum ", "closed_by": {"login": "ehuss", "id": 43198, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTk4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43198?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss", "html_url": "https://github.com/ehuss", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52146/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52146/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
