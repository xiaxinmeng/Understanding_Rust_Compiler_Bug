Here's a small reproduction (also on the [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=d33b43de0a7f7bb853ff77e855bf8937)).\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    // Write but never read. No warning is emitted\r\n    let mut arr = [0; 5];\r\n    arr[0] = 4;\r\n    [0][0] = 0;\r\n    \r\n    // Write but never read, the following warnings are emitted\r\n    \r\n    // warning: variable `x` is assigned to, but never used\r\n    //  --> src/main.rs:7:13\r\n    //   |\r\n    // 7 |     let mut x = 4;\r\n    //   |             ^\r\n    //   |\r\n    //   = note: `#[warn(unused_variables)]` on by default\r\n    //   = note: consider using `_x` instead\r\n    \r\n    // warning: value assigned to `x` is never read\r\n    //  --> src/main.rs:8:5\r\n    //   |\r\n    // 8 |     x = 12;\r\n    //   |     ^\r\n    //   |\r\n    //   = note: `#[warn(unused_assignments)]` on by default\r\n    //   = help: maybe it is overwritten before being read?\r\n    let mut x = 4;\r\n    x = 12;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect these lints to fire here, is this expected behavior?
