If only a `dep-info` file is generated, the output filename is pretty\n   unlikely to what's going to be compiled later on:\n   \n   ```\n   $ rustc foo.rs --emit dep-info\n   $ ls\n   foo.d  foo.rs\n   ```\n2. If a dep-info and link file are generated, you can't customize the output\n   filename of the dep-info file:\n   \n   ```\n   $ rustc foo.rs --emit dep-info,link -o foo.pp\n   warning: ignoring specified output filename because multiple outputs were requested\n   $ ls\n   foo.d       foo.rs      libfoo.rlib\n   ```\n\nThe compiler probably wants the ability to specify a dedicated location for the dep-info file during the same compilation of a staticlib or executable. For example, something like:\n\n```\n    --dep-file FILE     Configure output location of the dep-info output\n```\n\nThis would allow customizing the output location as well as enabling dep-info to know what the actual output artifact is (e.g. of the `link` output type).\n\nSome more info can be found on [this bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1208566).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28716/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28716/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
