We should be using the short method name to encourage the faster behaviour.\n\n`.reserve(n)` allocates exactly enough capacity to store `n` elements (if there isn't enough space already), while `.reserve_at_least(n)` will ensure that there is enough space, but overallocate to ensure that reallocations don't occur too often (i.e. increase the allocation size exponentially).\n\ne.g. imagine a protocol which consists of a sets of messages, where set block as an initial message with the count for that set:\n\n``` rust\nlet received = ~[];\nlet mut total_messages = 0;\nwhile listener.more_messages() {\n    let next_count = listener.recv();\n    total_messages += next_count;\n\n    // we know how many we're going to have total, so\n    // might as well allocate it up-front.\n    received.reserve(total_messages);\n\n    for _ in range(0, next_count) {\n        received.push(listener.recv());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nusing (the current) `.reserve` causes every single set to do a reallocation and `memcpy` (i.e. O(n^2) behaviour), while using `.reserve_at_least` would mean the reallocation and memcpy only happens logarithmically often, preserving O(n) asymptotics.\n\n(For vector specifically the above should really be using `.reserve_additional`, but other types like `~str` and `extra::{priority_queue, ring_buf}` suffer the same problem.)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11949/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11949/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
