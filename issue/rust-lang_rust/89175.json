One difficulty is that people experiencing breakage aren't given clear guidance on how to fix their code, which is a poor UX.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79965#issuecomment-889460086 I think the right answer in some cases (eg for a thorough test case) is to cut and paste the list of currently-stable kinds from the stdlib docs into one's codbase.  This is counterintuitive but IMO correct.\r\n\r\nI think it would be useful to recommend this somewhere in the docs for `io::ErrorKind`.  If the community agrees I will send an MR.
