https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/510, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/39915.\r\n\r\nGCC and Clang have several ways to specify linker.\r\n- `-B directory`, you specify a search directory, then the compiler finds a file named `ld` in it an uses it as a linker.\r\n  This is the old way working on all versions of GCC and Clang that we want to support (?).\r\n- `-fuse-ld=bfd|gold|lld|mold` limited to 4 well-known linker names, you specify the name, then the compiler finds a file named `ld.name` in its search directories.\r\n  This is a somewhat new way, the well-known name `-fuse-ld=lld` works in Clang, and in GCC since 2018 (which GCC version?).\r\n- `-fuse-ld=/absolute/path/to/lld`, where you specify the full linker path.\r\n  This doesn't work with GCC, and worked with Clang since 2016, but is now deprecated in favor of `--ld-path`.\r\n- `--ld-path=/absolute/path/to/lld`, where you specify the full linker path.\r\n  This doesn't work with GCC, and works with Clang since 2021.\r\n\r\n`rustc` needs to tell C compiler to use LLD in two modes\r\n- \"Self-contained\" mode when we need to find the LLD shipped with rustc.\r\n  This mode always uses `-B directory` right now (after https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/97375) just because it's simple to do, but it also means that old compilers are supported.\r\n- Mode in which we should find system-provided LLD.\r\n  **QUESTIONS:**\r\n    - How should we do it?\r\n    - Do we care about older GCC versions that don't support `-fuse-ld=lld`?", "closed_by": {"login": "petrochenkov", "id": 5751617, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTE2MTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5751617?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov", "html_url": "https://github.com/petrochenkov", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97402/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97402/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
