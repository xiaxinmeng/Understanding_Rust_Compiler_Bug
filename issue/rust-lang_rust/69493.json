that must be const by requiring `#[rustc_args_required_const]` everywhere. Currently, intrinsics beginning with the string \"simd_shuffle\" automatically get their third argument promoted. However, this broke the latest release of the `packed_simd` crate, which does not define the intrinsics with the requisite attribute (see #69313).\r\n\r\nAlthough this is allowed breakage (you can't define intrinsics without the nightly-only `platform_intrinsics` feature), I reverted #69280 for now, since it's just a small cleanup and isn't blocking anything. I opened rust-lang/packed_simd#278 to fix `packed_simd`. Once a version of that crate is released with the fix, we should reapply #69280.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69493/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69493/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
