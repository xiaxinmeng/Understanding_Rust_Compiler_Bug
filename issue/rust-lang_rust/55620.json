The hint is great when it's well-placed, but this time it doesn't make much sense, since it implies `&pat` should be replaced with `ref pat`. In the poster's case, autoderef handles `println!` even when `ref pat` is used, so perhaps the OP never noticed, but in many other cases this would cause issues. Using `ref pat` would cause `pat` to be of type `&&Box`, which isn't going to be the intent of the programmer.\r\n\r\nI think what the compiler means here is that `pat` should be replaced with `ref pat`, which would be `&ref pat`, and yeah that's correct. `&ref pat` can always be simplified to `pat` itself, so basically the compiler should avoid outputting the hint whenever the erroring identifier comes after an `&` (Since that would always lead to a redundant `&ref` construct if the hint is followed).\r\n\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "estebank", "id": 1606434, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY0MzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1606434?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank", "html_url": "https://github.com/estebank", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55620/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55620/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
