This would also let me change the type of test1 to `x : &mut i32`.\r\n\r\nThe only reason this code works (I believe) is that the extra `&mut` is immediately removed by `Deref`. I think the compiler should warn when an `&` or `&mut` is immediately removed by `Deref`, as it's probably a misunderstanding (or perhaps, this should be in clippy? If so I can copy this over there)", "closed_by": {"login": "ChrisJefferson", "id": 811527, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTUyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/811527?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson", "html_url": "https://github.com/ChrisJefferson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ChrisJefferson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/61580/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/61580/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
