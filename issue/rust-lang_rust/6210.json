There are many interrelated runtime features that expect independent access to mutable task-local or thread-local state, and this is difficult to model safely.\n\nMany of the unsafe features that need to be fixed use functions called `unsafe_borrow*`, like `unsafe_borrow`, `unsafe_borrow_io`, `unsafe_borrow_local_services`.\n\nMore things will need to be passed by value or ~. There are probably useful functional idioms that I'm not familiar with that could help.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6210/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6210/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
