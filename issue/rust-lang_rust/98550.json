But that doesn't happen, output is still captured. `--nocapture` seems to only control whether the output of rustc as it builds the test is captured or printed; it has no effect on the stdout/stderr of the test itself. That is quite inconsistent with regular unit tests where it controls the output of the test itself.\r\n\r\nInstead I have to do `RUSTDOCFLAGS=\"-Zunstable-options --nocapture\" cargo test --doc`, which is rather hard to find.\r\n\r\nTo make things even more surprising, `RUSTDOCFLAGS=\"-Zunstable-options --nocapture\" cargo test --doc -- --nocapture` fails with an error: \"Option 'nocapture' given more than once\".\r\n\r\nCc @rust-lang/rustdoc ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/98550/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/98550/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
