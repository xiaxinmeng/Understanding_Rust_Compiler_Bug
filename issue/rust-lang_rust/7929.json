This would have countless advantages, like the ast-fold could consume the AST and only allocate if it is actually creating a new node, and we'd generally not have the problems associated with `Gc` (the GC might be able to land!).\n\nHowever, there are a few areas that are very tricky; mainly the [AST map](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/master/src/libsyntax/ast_map.rs#L64-L81), which maps `node_id` to actual AST nodes of various types, the only safe way to do this with an `~` tree is with `&` references... which freezes the AST for the remainder of the program, so no transformations like constant evaluation, and no consuming of the AST by trans.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7929/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7929/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
