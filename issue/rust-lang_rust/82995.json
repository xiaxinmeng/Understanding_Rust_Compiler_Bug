When I came across this error, I had forgotten that the enum variant I was using was a tuple because it was in a different file that I hadn't looked at in a while. The `fn(u8) -> Test { Test::Variant }` notation threw me off and is _very_ difficult to search for. Some indication that this error is related to tuple enum variants, displaying the declaration of the variant in question, and/or giving more searchable terms might be more helpful?
