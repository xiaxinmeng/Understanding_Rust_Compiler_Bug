represent a method call (and never a call to the field `expr.m`).  This allows us to make a change to the compiler AST so that we have `expr_mcall()` (method call) and not `expr_call(expr_field())`, which in turn allows various other simplifications in borrowck, trans, and elsewhere.  In the process---or, perhaps, as first steps---I want to do some smaller refactorings:\n- Represent vtables as a tree and not the current flattened representation.  This will simplify code all over the place.\n- Remove the `callee_id` and just hang method information off in different tables (this basically requires an expr_mcall)\n- Maybe: change how operator overloading is implemented so that, from the front end's point of view, _all_ overloadable operations are method calls, but some of them call \"intrinsic\" methods.  Constant expressions are therefore restricted to such intrinsics, and of course trans will generate `a+b` the same way it does today.  \n", "closed_by": {"login": "pcwalton", "id": 157897, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton", "html_url": "https://github.com/pcwalton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3446/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3446/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
