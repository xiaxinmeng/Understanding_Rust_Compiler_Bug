With the work happening in OIBIT, I've tried to keep the implementations of built-in traits consistent for both `unix` and `windows`. Unfortunately, the test suite for these implementations is not unified, therefore there's a high chance that some types for `window`'s implementation may have some traits implemented, whereas the `unix`'s implementation doesn't.\n\nIn theory, we can assume that common types for these implementations should implement the same built-in types, therefore there should be tests that enforce this guarantee in a common place.\n\nSome examples may be found in `std::sys::{unix,windows}::{pipe,mutex}`\n\nThis bug is to track the work there which impacts the `stability` of our standard library.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "flaper87", "id": 13816, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13816?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87", "html_url": "https://github.com/flaper87", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/flaper87/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20260/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20260/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
