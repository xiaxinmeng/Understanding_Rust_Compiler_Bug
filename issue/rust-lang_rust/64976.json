It is only meant to be called from external\r\n    /// tools that want to reuse a `Parser` cleaning the previously emitted diagnostics as well as\r\n    /// the overall count of emitted error diagnostics.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in the body of this function the field `emitted_diagnostics` (which is `FxHashSet<u128>`) is rewritten by `Default::default()`, so it effectively frees the allocated memory instead of reusing it. Although the comment above that line underlines that this is intended, it seems to contradict the claimed behaviour.\r\n\r\ncc @Centril, @estebank.
