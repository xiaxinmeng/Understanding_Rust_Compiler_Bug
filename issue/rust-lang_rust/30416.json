It would also be convenient if rustdoc had linked to the source (with line numbers) of each trait implementation it lists. There are two reasons for this:\n1. impls can come from a different source file than the struct itself; they can come from the file where the trait was defined. Common examples include `Ext` traits and the primitive types (which have no source of their own). But in these cases, the implementation shows up on the struct's documentation page.\n2. It's pretty common to use a macro to implement a trait, which means that it's hard to find visually where the impl is coming from. For instance, [this line](http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.5.0/src/core/slice.rs.html#828) is the `impl Iterator for core::slice::Iter`.\n\nAnd then you have cases where [both of these are true](http://doc.rust-lang.org/1.5.0/src/core/fmt/mod.rs.html#1510-1511)....\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30416/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30416/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
