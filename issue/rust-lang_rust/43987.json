The first hit when I search for the attribute is <https://rustbyexample.com/attribute/crate.html> which doesn't mention this at all.\r\n\r\nThose sites should probably be fixed, but moreover, I think the compiler shouldn't just silently ignore these attributes. It should tell me. That would have saved me lots of time.\r\n\r\n(There may be other attributes which are similarly ignored. `crate_name` comes to my mind. But I don't know for sure.)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43987/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43987/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
