It appears this was done with no discussion, warning, or even a mention in the release notes.\r\n\r\nGiven that the `pc-solaris` target hasn't been around for that long (I think? feel free to tell me I'm wrong), I think this change should be reverted. My CI unexpectedly failed after being unable to download the target, and the only solution that wouldn't involve a notable increase in complexity of the CI script is to outright remove the checks for Solaris/Illumos \u2014 a let loss for everyone.\r\n\r\ncc @Mark-Simulacrum ", "closed_by": {"login": "jhpratt", "id": 3161395, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjEzOTU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3161395?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhpratt", "html_url": "https://github.com/jhpratt", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhpratt/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhpratt/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhpratt/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhpratt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhpratt/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhpratt/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhpratt/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhpratt/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jhpratt/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85098/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85098/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
