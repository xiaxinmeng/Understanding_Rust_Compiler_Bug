If you end a constructor with a compound expression, thus:\n\n```\nclass foo {\n    let x:();\n    new() {\n        self.x = ();\n        if (1 == 1) {\n            io::println(\"foo\");\n        } else {\n            io::println(\"bar\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou end up with:\n\n```\n\nsemicolon.rs:5:8: 9:9 error: mismatched types: expected `foo` but found `()` (class foo vs ())\nsemicolon.rs:5         if (1 == 1) {\nsemicolon.rs:6             io::println(\"foo\");\nsemicolon.rs:7         } else {\nsemicolon.rs:8             io::println(\"bar\");\nsemicolon.rs:9         }\n```\n\nI guess a constructor is allowed to return either () or the type it's constructing (a fact I did not previously know). It looks like the typechecker, seeing the if-then-else, can only assign it one of those types, and picks 'class foo' rather than '()', when it should pick '()'.\n\nThis can be worked around by putting a semicolon after the end of the if.\n\nI'm really not sure if this is a bug or just a weird-but-correct behavior; I don't have a good grasp of the effect of semicolons on expression types yet. But it seems like it can only happen in constructors, with their weird return-type behavior, which makes me lean more towards bug.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "catamorphism", "id": 427212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzIxMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/427212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism", "html_url": "https://github.com/catamorphism", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2844/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2844/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
