(online) check out rust code base\n2.  (online) run `./configure`\n3.  (offline) build with `make` (successfully)\n4.  connect to the web via phone while on train (low data limit and slow)\n5.  `make install` ... only instead of just installing the existing build output it somehow notices that a new snapshot is available and tries to download (at which point I kill)\n6.  (offline again) `make` now fails\n\nMaybe this is not a common use case, but intuitively I would not expect building to update dependencies unless (a) they have not yet been fetched, (b) newer versions are required than installed (i.e. after repo update) or (c) on manual command. Is it possible to do this?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24026/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24026/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
