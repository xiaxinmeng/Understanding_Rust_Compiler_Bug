If a project depends on crate `foo v0.1.0` with MSRV 1.56, then releasing crate `foo v0.1.1` with MSRV 1.60 will break build of the project on older toolchains after simple `cargo update`. Ideally Cargo would select `foo v0.1.0` on older tolchains, thus preventing the breakage.\r\n\r\nRFC 2495 has [described](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2495-min-rust-version.md#influencing-version-resolution) MSRV-dependent version resolution as a potential future extension.
