Also I didn't found [any new issue from **`@rust-highfive`** about Miri in `rust-lang/rust`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/created_by/rust-highfive), so I assume Miri should build from the `master` branch of it.\r\nHowever, Miri [is not available](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup-components-history/) in the latest nightly (`nightly-2020-11-17`, rust-lang/rust@f5230fbf76bafd86ee4376a0e26e551df8d17fec) from `rustup`. rust-lang/rust@f5230fbf76bafd86ee4376a0e26e551df8d17fec already contains rust-lang/rust#78990. Actually Miri is missing since `nightly-2020-11-10`, and is still missing even rust-lang/rust#78990 has been merged.\r\n\r\nI can't find any additional information about Miri in the latest nightly. What's going on with it?\r\n\r\n*Edit: I mentioned the wrong PR. It should be #78990 instead of `#78890`.* ", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79129/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79129/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
