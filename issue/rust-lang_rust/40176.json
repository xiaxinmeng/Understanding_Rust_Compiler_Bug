Upon returning, the thread is the only thread with the mutex\r\n/// held. An RAII guard is returned to allow scoped unlock of the lock. When\r\n/// the guard goes out of scope, the mutex will be unlocked.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, *the lock* and *the mutex* are used to refer to the same `Mutex` object. As a non-native English speaker, this kind of inconsistency is  somewhat confusing. This is especially the case for this document because *lock* also refers to the operation on the mutex object.\r\n\r\nI do understand these two words are interchangable unless you are writing a thesis or the like. However, I feel that using them consistently throughout the document makes it more readable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would like to suggest to use *mutex* to refer to the `Mutex` object, and *lock* or *unlock* to refer to the operations on the `Mutex` object.\r\n\r\ne.g. An RAII guard is returned to allow scoped unlock of the mutex.\r\n\r\nSorry in advance if this inconsistency is intentional.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40176/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40176/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
