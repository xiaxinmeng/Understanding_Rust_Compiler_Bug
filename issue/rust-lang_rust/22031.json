I\u2019m treating this as a bug because it seems to me that trait `Foo` _is_ in fact object safe, whereas the compiler says otherwise.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "ftxqxd", "id": 2055302, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTUzMDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2055302?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd", "html_url": "https://github.com/ftxqxd", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ftxqxd/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22031/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22031/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
