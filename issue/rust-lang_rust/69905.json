I've got a file with these contents:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n/*!\r\n * * Hello\r\n *     * World\r\n *\r\n  * Lorem\r\n */\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a little weird, but it's the minimum case I found to reproduce the issue.  The unusual leading space on line 5 is important.  (If you're wondering how I got here, it was from [rustfmt issue 4079](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/4079).)\r\n\r\nI expected that if I ran `rustdoc --test`, I would find that it passed after having run 0 tests, since there doesn't appear to be a doc test here.\r\n\r\nBut `rustdoc --test` reports:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rustdoc --version\r\nrustdoc 1.41.0 (5e1a79984 2020-01-27)\r\n$ rustdoc --test issue.rs \r\n\r\nrunning 1 test\r\ntest issue.rs -  (line 2) ...

I think that's not right for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The [CommonMark spec for indented code blocks](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#indented-code-blocks) says \"there must be a blank line between a paragraph and a following indented code block.\"  It also says \"If there is any ambiguity between an interpretation of indentation as a code block and as indicating that material belongs to a list item, the list item interpretation takes precedence.\"\r\n2. To test this, I took lines 2-4, dropped the leading \" *\", and put them into the CommonMark \"dingus\" tool, which [renders it as a list, not an indented code block](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/?text=%20*%20Hello%0A%20%20%20%20%20*%20World%0A%0A).\r\n3. The real kicker is that if you take the exact same example and remove the leading space on **line 5**, then the example works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ diff issue.rs non-issue.rs \r\n5c5\r\n<   * Lorem\r\n---\r\n>  * Lorem\r\n$ rustdoc --test non-issue.rs \r\n\r\nrunning 0 tests\r\n\r\ntest result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how that change to line 5 affects how line 3 gets parsed.", "closed_by": {"login": "GuillaumeGomez", "id": 3050060, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTAwNjA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3050060?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez", "html_url": "https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69905/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69905/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
