This is a \"safe\" feature of rust I didn't know about.\r\n\r\nI was at first confused about the docs for `std::mem::replace` however. My main confusion was around the \"deinitializing\" word which made me think that  `T` is _not_ consumed. It _is_ consumed but it is _not dropped_, which is a subtle distinction. I propose here to remove the confusing language.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Current docs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/new)\r\n> `pub fn replace<T>(dest: &mut T, src: T) -> T`\r\n> \r\n> Replaces the value at a mutable location with a new one, returning the old value, without deinitializing either one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggested new docs:\r\n> `pub fn replace<T>(dest: &mut T, src: T) -> T`\r\n> \r\n> Consumes `src` to replace the value at `dest` in-place, returning the old value.\r\n>\r\n> Neither value is dropped.\r\n\r\nAnother possible option (I don't like it as much but it is more similar to the previous docs):\r\n> `pub fn replace<T>(dest: &mut T, src: T) -> T`\r\n> \r\n> Replaces the value at a mutable location with a new one, returning the old value.\r\n>\r\n> Neither value is dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I have not seen the \"deinitialized\" qualifier in rust before. I don't think it is part of the standard rust lingo which is probably some of my confusion :smile: \r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/50657/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 5, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/50657/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
