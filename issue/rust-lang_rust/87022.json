Typically this is a PR\r\nimplementing a feature, followed by a PR that stabilises the feature. However\r\nfor larger features an implementation could be broken up into multiple PRs.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Add the flag (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83857)\r\n- [ ] Update libtest not to say \"ok\" for tests which aren't run (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83857#discussion_r609784055)\r\n- [ ] Fix the flag to actually work (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88110)\r\n- [ ] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][doc-guide]) - rustdoc's documentation lives in `src/doc/rustdoc`.\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][stabilization-guide])\r\n\r\n[stabilization-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr\r\n[doc-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#documentation-prs\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is `--no-run` the right name?\r\n\r\n### Implementation history\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a list of all the PRs that were involved in implementing the feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Initial implementation (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83857)\r\n\r\n<details><summary>original issue text</summary>\r\n\r\nThe cargo issue here https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6424 points out that we don't have a tracking issue on the librustdoc side for how we can make doc examples compile when we run `cargo check --all-targets` or `cargo build --all-targets`. By hook or by crook it would be great to remove this surprising edge case.\r\n\r\nAlso probably even more surprising `cargo test --no-run` also doesn't compile the doc tests.\r\n\r\nMaybe we need a `cargo test --sligtly-run-doctests`?\r\n\r\n</details>", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87022/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87022/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
