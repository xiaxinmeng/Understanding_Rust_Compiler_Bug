I'm particularly interested in the simplicity aspect, since I recall some old conversations regarding our current machinery for this being somewhat subtle and complicated (for speed purposes, I imagine). If we could drastically simplify the implementation without sacrificing speed, that might be a win. Good student or intern project, methinks.\r\n\r\n(Apologies for how wishlisty this issue is, I've no clue who might be the presiding expert on our current float->string implementation.)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52811/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52811/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
