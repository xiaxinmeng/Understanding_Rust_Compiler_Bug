Instead of an explicit stack switch to call Rust code, we'll just Run it on the foreign stack. Then the Rust code will start adding new stack segments as needed.\n\nThis will give uv callbacks better performance, and will eliminate some of performance concerns around calls from SpiderMonkey into the Rust DOM.\n\nIt will also eliminate the need to set the TCB stack pointer to 0 when entering the native stack, eliminating some of the need for `no_split_stack`.
