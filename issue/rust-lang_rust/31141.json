Note that `-A warnings` does indeed suppress the warning, but Cargo no longer pases `-A warnings`.\n\nThis ends up meaning that if you just updated to Rust 1.6 (where `raw_pointer_derive` was removed) and recompile your project, you're actually pretty likely to get tons of these warnings from all your upstream dependencies. (although you yourself are unlikely to have `allow(raw_pointer_derive)`. Ideally these warnings would behave like other lint warnings in Cargo, which is that they are ignored in dependencies by default (e.g. suppressed via `--cap-lints allow`).\n\ncc @wycats (reporter)\ncc @brson (implementor)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31141/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31141/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
