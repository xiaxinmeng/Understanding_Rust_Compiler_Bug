It has to do with [this commit](https://github.com/aepsil0n/carboxyl/commit/5d848f4cefc6cdbbb91e2c2aa65af208576f8fec). The essence is, that before the change there was a struct field that remained uninitialized at first and was only set later in the same function. When I tried to run a benchmark using this code compiled with `opt-level=3`, the program segfaulted.\n\nNow I am perfectly aware, that there are a lot of reasons for why it is dangerous to do that and I am also fine using an `Option` here. Nonetheless, there are two reasons, why I am still reporting this as an issue:\n- There were no runtime failures after I switched to using an `Option`, so I suspect that the code should not have crashed trying to drop uninitialized memory during unwinding.\n- The error only occurred in the benchmarks, i.e. with `opt-level=3`. Manually compiling the same benchmark without optimizations was successful.\n\nGiven these observations I wonder, whether there might be a problem with the optimization passes here. I tried to reproduce this issue in a minimal example but did not succeed.
