For example, this code fails to compile\n\n``` rust\nuse std::rt::io;\n\nstruct HttpResponse<'self> {\n    out: &'self mut io::Writer,\n}\n\nfn write_http_header(_: &mut io::Writer) {}\n\nimpl<'self> HttpResponse<'self> {\n    fn respond(&mut self) {\n        write_http_header(self.out);\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {}\n```\n\n```\nfoo.rs:11:26: 11:34 error: cannot move out of dereference of & pointer\nfoo.rs:11         write_http_header(self.out);\n                                    ^~~~~~~~\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n```\n\nThe specific example I hit was when I was ripping out `@::std::io::Writer` from `std::repr`. At some point the visitor decides to give its buffer to a child visitor for the small duration of a call, and there's also a point where it shoves passes the buffer directly to an object's `write_repr` method.\n\nThe errors are completely legitimate (given what I believe are today's region rules for `&mut`). That being said however, it seems like a fairly common use-case. Tweaking the rules to realize that this is safe could be quite difficult, but perhaps it's possible?\n\nIf this doesn't turn out to be a common case, then there's really no need to deal with it. For now I've resorted to using `transmute_copy` in a few places in #8414\n\ncc @brson for io::Writer feedback\ncc @nikomatsakis for if rules would be impossible to tweak\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8529/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8529/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
