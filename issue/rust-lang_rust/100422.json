(And same for the other bases.)\r\n\r\nIt's not obvious to me that that's necessarily the best option.  For example, the `(BITS-1) - LeadingZeros` implementation is slightly nicer on CPUs from the past decade or so <https://rust.godbolt.org/z/3q6WME84Y> (and I think would be just as nice on older ones [if LLVM was a bit smarter](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/47467)), but gives `-1`<sub>as u32</sub> in the wrapping case.\r\n\r\nIt also might be nice to have the wrapping case give something clearly different from any of the successful cases, rather than having `1.ilog2()` and `0.ilog2()` give the same thing.  For example `u32::MAX.next_power_of_two()` returns `0` in release mode, which *isn't* a power of two (according to `is_power_of_two`), so it's distinguishable from all the non-wrapping cases.\r\n\r\nThis only affects `ilog`/`ilog2`/`ilog10` on `uNN`.  (The checked versions don't have an issue, nor do the ones on `NonZeroUNN`.)", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100422/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100422/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
