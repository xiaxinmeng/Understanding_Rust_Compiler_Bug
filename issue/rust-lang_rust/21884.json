The error message even says \"there is no way to use this feature\", which kinda sounds like \"tough to be you!\". #21883 is one instance that is likely fixed in ##21745, but upgrading Servo is now blocked until #21745 lands or we backport it. Additionally, there may be other instances that we haven\u2019t found yet, causing another cycle of fixing Rust.\n\nInstead of making this a hard error, it\u2019d be better to offer to opt into using such items anyway. It could be `#[feature(yes_i_promise_i_ve_filed_a_bug_about_this_but_please_let_me_carry_on_now)]` for example :)\n\nCC @brson\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21884/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21884/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
