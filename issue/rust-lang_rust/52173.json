It exists to take into account the fact that a panicked thread may poison the lock, thereby corrupting the state of whatever is contained within the lock.\r\n\r\nWhen developing in Rust, it is common to search a codebase for instances of `.unwrap()` to find places in which the code may panic. However, instances of `.unwrap()` are extremely common in multithreaded code where locks are frequently used.\r\n\r\nSince calling `.unwrap()` upon a `LockResult<Guard>` **only** triggers a panic if a panic has already occurred in the thread holding the lock, it cannot be the 'original' source of a panic, and therefore is perfectly fine to call in a codebase in which no other instances of `.unwrap()` exist.\r\n\r\nI suggest implementing a `.propagate_panic()` method on `LockResult<Guard>` that has identical functionality to `.unwrap()`, but prevents additional noise when searching a codebase for real sources of panics.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52173/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52173/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
