However, it turns out in #86589 that our old version of normalize.css is hiding the triangles on user-provided `<details>` tags, when it shouldn't be.\r\n\r\nSee these demos:\r\n\r\nhttps://jsbin.com/jorowazuli/edit?html,output\r\n\r\nhttps://jsbin.com/kecozayaka/edit?html,output\r\n\r\nThe right path forward is to figure out why upgrading normalize.css caused those regressions, fix the issues, and then do the upgrade.
