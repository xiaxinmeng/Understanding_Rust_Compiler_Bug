This suggestion should only be emitted when it's about an _expression_ of type `[T; N]`, and not a trait bound that arises some other way (like the type being explicitly written in the code).\n\n### Other cases\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThis invalid suggestion also occurs in serde autoderived implementations of Deserialize, if a field of the struct/enum is an array with more than 32 elements. (This is the context where I initially discovered this, the MVE above is a reverse-engineering of that case).\r\n\r\nThis seems to only happen in nightly. I think this is just because this suggestion was added after 1.68.0 was released, or something like that.\r\n\r\nThe commit that introduced this suggestion (and also the bug) is 8ac7d0eef5621338d3650ec6884c58bc28a5c5f6.\r\n\r\nPlayground link: https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=ec4aeb169fe3a41cfecf995c8cd66150", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110063/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 1, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110063/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
