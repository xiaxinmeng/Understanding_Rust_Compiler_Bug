Ok, but could rustdoc have helped me know this was happening?\r\n\r\n**I expected to see this happen:**\r\n\r\nI hope to see some explicit indication that the two symbols refer to the same item. The actual approach might be tricky to get right in a manner that is explicit but not too much clutter.\r\n\r\nI've seen rustdoc explicitly annotate that when re-exporting across crate boundaries. Is there some way to do this for intra-crate renaming re-exports so that the crate-level doc would move `IpfsClient` out of the structs section and into a re-exports section with a crate-local path? It currently looks like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/assets/4369700/13bce4db-ad45-424c-a41d-5ff93e5b7744)\r\n\r\nWith this proposed approach, the rendering for the type interface would consistently use `HyperBackend`.\r\n\r\n### Related Tickets\r\n\r\nI searched this issue tracker with [`is:issue is:open use as label:A-rustdoc-ui`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?page=2&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+use+as+label%3AA-rustdoc-ui) to find these tickets both of which rename to `_` which is distinct from my issue:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/97615\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/92379\r\n\r\nI filed [this PR](https://github.com/ferristseng/rust-ipfs-api/pull/131) against [rust-ipfs-api](https://github.com/ferristseng/rust-ipfs-api) which replaces `use foo as bar` with explicit type aliases as a work-around. That PR has more screenshots of the difference in doc rendering between the two approaches.\r\n### Meta\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n\r\nWhatever https://docs.rs used to render https://docs.rs/ipfs-api-backend-hyper/0.6.0/ipfs_api_backend_hyper/index.html", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/111886/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/111886/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
