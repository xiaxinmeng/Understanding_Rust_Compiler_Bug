If one views Rust as a targeted replacement for C++, then it seems weird to depend on it!\n\nThere are currently four reasons why rust depends on C++\n1. We use the `new` operator which I believe throws on OOM\n2. We use statically initialized mutexes (statically run constructors)\n3. We use exceptions to implement unwinding.\n4. When linking librustrt, g++ is used instead of gcc\n\nI have successfully extracted the dependency on C++ as part of https://github.com/alexcrichton/rust/commit/4b2bb6fc741663bd8b68ae5ec91103289532d963. That patch is nowhere near a landable form, however.\n\nI'm coming to believe that this is a fairly important dependency that we should be able to rid ourselves of (with strings attached). I propose the following plan of attack.\n1. Complete #9105 \n2. Remove all usage of static mutexes from C++ along with usage of the `new` operator\n3. Move as many foo.cpp files to foo.c to prevent C++ from leaking in again.\n4. Add a compilation profile to librustrt. This new profile would turn `rust_try` to just calling `f`, and `rust_begin_unwind` would be equivalent to `assert(false)`. This new `librustrt` would be distributed along the rust standard libraries as `librustrt_no_landing_pads` or something like that.\n5. When compiling with `-Z no-landing-pads`, link to `librustrt_no_landing_pads` instead of `librustrt`\n\nAs the strategy implies, the only way to drop the C++ dependency would be to forgo unwinding entirely. For now this is our best option of dropping the C++ dependency, and perhaps in the future if we ever implement unwinding without C++ exceptions we won't even need this business of a separate compilation profile.\n\nHow do others feel about this?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10469/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10469/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
