I'm not sure whether this should be changed into a diagnostic which states that this kind of thing is explicitly forbidden for required methods, or if omitting the method should be allowed.\r\n\r\nMy main goal is to require a by-value method for sized types, but to not require it for unsized types and settle for just by-ref methods.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84839/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84839/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
