Specifically, currently (as of 1.62) the output looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rustc -vV\r\nrustc 1.62.1\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: unknown\r\ncommit-date: unknown\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.62.1\r\nLLVM version: 14.0.6\r\n```\r\n\r\nI propose to change this to print:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rustc -vV\r\nrustc 1.62.1\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: unknown\r\ncommit-date: unknown\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\ntarget: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.62.1\r\nLLVM version: 14.0.6\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rustc --target i686-unknown-linux-gnu -vV\r\nrustc 1.62.1\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: unknown\r\ncommit-date: unknown\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\ntarget: i686-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.62.1\r\nLLVM version: 14.0.6\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe value for the `target` line will be the same as `llvm-target` in the `--print target-spec-json` output.\r\n\r\nHere is the motivation for this addition:\r\n\r\n1. Currently, AFAIK, the only way to get this information is with the `--print target-spec-json` option which is unstable. This means one can only use it on the nightly compiler (or resort to the `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1` hacks). While there is desire to stabilize this option (see #38338), the progress has been slow and it's currently blocked on design concerns.\r\n\r\n2. Even if/when `--print target-spec-json` is stabilized, it would still be beneficial to provide the target triplet as part of the `-vV` output because that would allow getting the commonly needed information (compiler version and target) with a single compiler invocation. As it is currently, in the build system I work on (`build2`), we have to make two compiler invocations to get this information.\r\n\r\n3. It appears that some users are confusing the host triplet (as printed in `-vV`) for target. For example, see answers to [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52996949/how-can-i-find-the-current-rust-compilers-default-llvm-target-triple). By printing both we will hopefully make people pause and contemplate the difference.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like a good idea, I can try to come up with a PR.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/105588/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/105588/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "not_planned"}
