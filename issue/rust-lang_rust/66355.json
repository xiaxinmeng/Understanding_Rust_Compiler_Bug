Basically, we just want to cache the `src/doc/rustc-guide/book/linkcheck` directory between builds. This directory is generated by the linkchecker. Doing this would significantly reduce timeouts and other networking issues when linkchecking... We already use this functionality on the rustc-guide repo with Travis caching...", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66355/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66355/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
