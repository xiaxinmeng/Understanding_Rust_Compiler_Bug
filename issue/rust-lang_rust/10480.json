(#10307)\n\nWe need:\n- `Timezone` type whose constructor may understand common time zone strings.\n- `fn localtime(&self, utc_time) -> Tm` method for `Timezone`. (This seems quite hard because it seems that there is no corresponding libc function)\n- For environment timezone, we may provide `unsafe fn get_env_tz() ->  Timezone`.\n\nI think this overlaps [datetime design](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Lib-datetime) a bit, but anyway current implementation is \"unsafe\".\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Gankra", "id": 1136864, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjExMzY4NjQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1136864?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra", "html_url": "https://github.com/Gankra", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gankra/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10480/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10480/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
