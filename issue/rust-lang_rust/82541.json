The expression `make()` in fact has type `Result<Vec<..>>`.  If it had the type `Vec<(usize, char)>` as the error message claims, the code would be correct.\r\n\r\nThe bug in the program is a missing `?`.\r\n\r\nI think the diagnostics bug is in the reporting the type of `Item` after the `for`-induced `IntoIterator` call as if it were the type of the iterator.\r\n\r\nPerhaps something like this would be better:\r\n\r\n```\r\n6 |     for (i,j) in make() {\r\n  |         ^^^^^    ------ this iterator yields `Item`s of type `Vec<(usize, char)>`\r\n  |         |\r\n  |         expected struct `Vec`, found `Item` of type tuple\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat would at least be true, although it would still be a bit obtuse.  (We have the common problem of \"expected\" vs \"found\" being backwards, which really doesn't help.)\r\n\r\nBetter, if possible, would be something mentioning the fact that `Result` is being treated as the iterator for `for`, which is probably not what the user intended.  Similarly for `Option` I guess, as regards diagnostics,.\r\n\r\n`for .. in Result<..>` is a bit of a footgun because as well as producing a confusing type situation, it throws away the error if there was one.\r\n\r\nhttps://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=9cdf69fd508fd36973bd1e1c7313cbd3", "closed_by": {"login": "compiler-errors", "id": 3674314, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzQzMTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3674314?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors", "html_url": "https://github.com/compiler-errors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/compiler-errors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82541/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82541/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
