This makes a lot of problems and confusions.\n- \"Missing libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll\" is frequently reported: #3319, #3655, #7089, #9218 and more.\n- libpthread-2.dll is renamed to pthreadGC2.dll. User have to install old package or copy dll. See #8786\n- If libstdc++-6.dll is incompatible (i.e. too new), rustc segfaults with no clue. See #5220 and its the first comment.\n#3459 suggests portable version of installer, but it cannot be done in near future since we rely on `g++` linker.\n\nInstead, we can bundle dlls with stage0 archive then we only depend on external g++ executable, not any runtime libraries.\n\nThis may also help upgrading mingw (#8598): currently, if you want to build rust with recent mingw or mingw-w64 (#8996), you have to copy old dlls at `<builddir>/<triple>/stage0/bin/`. It is really inconvenient.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9252/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9252/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
