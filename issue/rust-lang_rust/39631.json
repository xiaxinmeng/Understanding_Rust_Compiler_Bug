I have some idea how to fix it, will try to draft a pull request later, but it basically requires checking the sign of the `i64`, `neg`ging if required and casting to `u64`, and using `checked_add` or `checked_sub`.\r\n\r\nI will divide into cases to demonstrate that this is required, to save repeating phrases, I will use the following notation:\r\nS means `pos < i64::max_value()`, L means `pos > i64::max_value()`;\r\nP means `n >= 0`, N means `n < 0`;\r\nO+ means we will notice bads by checking OF on add (`u64::checked_add`), O- means we will notice them by checking OF on sub (`u64::checked_sub` after `i64::wrapping_neg`), Z+ means we will notice by adding as `i64` and making sure result is non-negative, Z- is making sure it is negative, D+ mean we will notice bads by asserting OF *is set* on add (`u64::overflowing_add`), D- is likewise for sub (`u64::overflowing_sub`). Note the we don't need to consider `n == i64::min_value()`, because after `i64::wrapping_neg` and `as u64` we still get the right, large, positive number.\r\nSo, we have the following cases and appropriate checks that spot trouble:\r\n- SP -> O+Z+D- (there's never a problem, but the others false-positive)\r\n- LP -> O+Z-D- (but D- requires also that the result is non-zero).\r\n- SN -> O-Z+D+\r\n- LN -> O-D+ (there's never a problem, but the others false-positive)\r\n\r\nOverall, we see that there is no one test which works for all cases, and a minimum of two cases (and tests) yields the solution described above.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39631/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39631/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
