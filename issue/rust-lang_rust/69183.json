But some double-checking showed that the flags did not actually seem to have any effect. And indeed, the following test passes, when really it should fail because one revision has bad flags:\r\n```rust\r\n// revisions: a b\r\n// [a]compile-flags: -D not_a_lint\r\n\r\n// build-pass\r\n\r\nfn main() {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt took me a bit to realize that I made the mistake of writing `// [a]compile-flags:` instead of `//[a]compile-flags:`. This is quite surprising because compiletest flag parsing is not very space-sensitive elsewhere (e.g., `//compile-flags` and `// compile-flags` both work).", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69183/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69183/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
