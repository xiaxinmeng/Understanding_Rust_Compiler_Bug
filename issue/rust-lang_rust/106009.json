For instance, `Option`'s `Some` variant is recorded as having a field named `__0`, rather than `0`.\r\n\r\nI think this is a little unfortunate. Tuple indices behave quite like field names in Rust, insofar that they're accessed with `.` and that you can instantiate tuple-like structs and variants as if they are records; e.g.:\r\n```rust\r\nSome { 0: true };\r\n```\r\nIt's odd, then, that these fields would not appear in a debugger as they would in Rust.\r\n\r\nMy own stake in this is [deflect](https://docs.rs/deflect/0.1.0/deflect/), allows you to get fields by name from structs and variants. Users reflecting on tuple-like structs and variants must know to prefix their queries with `__`, and the pretty-printer and serializers provided by `deflect` cannot generally strip away the `__` from field names.\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/106009/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/106009/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
