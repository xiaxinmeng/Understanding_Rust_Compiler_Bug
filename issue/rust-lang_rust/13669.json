I would like to have such a standalone guide, and these are some ideas about what should be in it.\n\nThis is a guide that runs through creating an entire Rust project from installation, using the tools, writing code, through deployment, touching on the practical aspects of coding Rust, not glossing over whatever ugly bits are necessary to do real work.\n\nSome of the topics I might expect include:\n- Installation\n- Running rustc\n- lib.rs/bin.rs/mod.rs conventions\n- Evolving a project from a single file to multi-file/mod/directory\n- Picking the correct types for various problems\n- Obtaining and using other crates\n- Setting up a build system (not cargo to start, cargo when it's ready)\n- Working with the compiler to find the correct algorithms. Show typical ways you might concieve the solution incorrectly and how the compiler helps guide you to the correct one. Particularly re: borrowck.\n- Common Rust patterns (like?)\n- Rust CI, other community resources?\n- Using rust-bindgen to create bindings that don't already exist\n- Error handling\n- Practical corner cases and workarounds of various types, e.g.\n  - #[path], #[link_args]?\n\nThere's some overlap here with the current tutorial, which I think is good, since I want to find new homes for most of the content there.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13669/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13669/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
