However, it is unclear whether this is stable or just an implementation detail. This [line in the implementation of UnsafeCell](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/library/core/src/cell.rs#L1713-L1714) notes that \"there is no guarantee for user code that this [casting a `*const UnsafeCell<T>` to `*mut T`] will work in future versions of the compiler\"; but it is unclear whether this applies to the casting of `*const UnsafeCell<T>` to `*const T` or the casting of `*const T` to `*mut T`. [`as_slice_of_cells`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/cell/struct.Cell.html#method.as_slice_of_cells) also relies on the layout of `UnsafeCell`, but makes no mention of it being exclusive to std.\r\n\r\nEven if they do stably have a transparent layout, there are also some questions to be resolved around whether _creating_ `UnsafeCell`s from references is UB; conversions like `*const T` to `*const UnsafeCell<T>`, `&T` to `&UnsafeCell<T>`, `&mut T` to `&UnsafeCell<T>`, `&[UnsafeCell<T>]` to `&UnsafeCell<[T]>` should all probably be specified.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79303/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79303/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
