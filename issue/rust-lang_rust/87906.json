This means that creating a `Duration` via `Instant::duration_since` will be notably shorter than expected if the system suspended between the `&self` instance and the `earlier` argument.\r\n\r\nIf `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` is used instead, the clock is guaranteed to continue ticking during suspend. This closer matches the documentation and real world usage of `Instant`. The documentation for `Instant::duration_since` reads \"Returns the amount of time elapsed from another instant to this one.\" - no mention of an exception for suspend or other low power states. `tokio` uses `Instant` to govern its sleep and timeout functionality. Given that `tokio` is commonly used to implement network servers and clients, slicing out suspended time was likely not their intention.\r\n\r\nUsing `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` should have minimal impact on existing usage. Performance-wise, `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` is implemented in Linux by getting the `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` time and adding an offset to it. That offset is updated as part of exiting suspend. As a result, the total cost should be an extra two loads , two adds, and maybe two stores with bad optimization, which are all negligible compared to the cost of servicing a system call. In terms of existing applications, the only ones which will see new behavior is ones which are measuring time across suspends. The only use case I can think of for wanting the old `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` behavior is time-multiplexing system resources, but I am not aware of an actual user.\r\n\r\n## Other projects on the same issue\r\n* Go decided against [switching its runtime](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24595) to use `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` due to  \r\n* Linux [converted](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d6ed449afdb38f89a7b38ec50e367559e1b8f71f) `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` to act like `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` since it was almost always the desired behavior, and technically spec compatible, but [reverted](https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable/+/a3ed0e4393d6885b4af7ce84b437dc696490a530) it shortly afterwards due to compatibility issues.\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"hellow554\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87906/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 3, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87906/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
