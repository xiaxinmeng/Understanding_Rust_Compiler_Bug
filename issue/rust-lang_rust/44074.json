This will make it more feasible to detect (and lint about) the usage of environment variables only set by newer build bits (e.g. Cargo) without an appropriate versioned dependency; for instance, it'd be possible to say \"you use the `$CARGO_FOO` environment variable without a dependency on a version of Cargo that supplies `$CARGO_FOO`. This would also help people doing reproducible builds to see what environment variables might affect a build.\r\n\r\nThis will never be perfect; it can't capture variables read from native code or from code that goes out of its way to bypass the normal mechanism (e.g. calling `libc::getenv`.)
