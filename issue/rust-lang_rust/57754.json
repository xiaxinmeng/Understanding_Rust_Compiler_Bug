At the bottom there is a number `load: XXX` in pink\r\n> \r\n> Now do the same procedure for the nightly docs https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.32.0/core/convert/trait.TryFrom.html\r\n> \r\n> What I see is a difference in the pink load time. For nightly, it's 466 ms and for stable, it's 1.6 seconds.\r\n> \r\n> Now let's dig a little bit deeper. There is a \"performance analysis\" tab in the Firefox developer tools.\r\n> Here you can see what the browser is doing to load a page.\r\n> \r\n> If you visit the nightly page, there is a clear yellow bar with 597 ms wait time for me. If you click this bar you can see that it's spending in search-index.js. If you visit the stable page, you have to search a bit for the yellow bar of search-index.js but if you find it, it's much much smaller. Only 52 ms!\r\n> \r\n> So I'd claim that the regression in load time is due to a parsing time regression for search-index.js.\r\n> \r\n> I can experience the bug on a personal project that uses nightly as well, and here it's far more grave (multiple seconds to wait), most probably because it's a bigger project.\r\n> \r\n> I experience this bug only since a few days, thus I believe this to be a regression of this PR: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/56869\r\n\r\nOne idea I had is to use an array instead of creating a lot of variables. It'll certainly take a bit more space but I think it'll allow to remove the parsing performance issue.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57754/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/57754/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
