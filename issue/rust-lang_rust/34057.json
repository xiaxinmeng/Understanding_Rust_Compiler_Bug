This can be used to document known bugs and shortcomings of a package alongside the package's main documentation. For examples, see the bottom of [`net`](https://golang.org/pkg/net/), [`sync/atomic`](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/), or [`encoding/xml`](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/xml/). \n\nHaving a similar feature in `rustdoc` would be really useful, as it establishes a standard way of communicating known problems, which could prevent unnecessary bug reports, and encourage dialogue about known limitations.
