This means that thread locals purportedly work on the wasm target when in fact (I think) they only work on the wasm target with the `atomics` feature enabled.\r\n\r\nIdeally the compiler would conditionally define this `cfg` on wasm (depending on other target features enabled), and then this could enable cleaning up the definitions of thread locals in libstd a bit by relying more on `target_thread_local` and not special-casing wasm so much.\r\n\r\nThis came out of a discussion in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83416", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84224/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84224/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
