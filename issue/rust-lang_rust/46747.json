is concerned that two-phased borrows are a hazard. In particular, they are coupled to MIR code-generation, which means if we are too aggressive in how much code we accept today, it could mean that a later change to MIR construction will inject a regression.\r\n\r\nNiko has suggested a simple strategy for fixing this that we should deploy before we stabilize two-phase borrows: We should thread through information about whether a borrow was introduced via method-call autoref, and then *only* do the two-phase borrow system for those autorefs.\r\n\r\nThat way we will be somewhat conservative in what code is deemed acceptable by two-phase borrows today, and therefore give us more breathing room in the future as we refine the system.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46747/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46747/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
