The tag rustdoc currently generates is very low-information. For instance:\r\n\r\n> API documentation for the Rust `slice` mod in crate `std`\r\n\r\n> API documentation for the Rust `Error` trait in crate `std`.\r\n\r\nIt would be much better to fill this tag with the first sentence (or two) of actual documentation. For instance:\r\n\r\n> A dynamically-sized view into a contiguous sequence, [T]. Slices are a view into a block of memory represented as a pointer and a length.\r\n\r\n> Error is a trait representing the basic expectations for error values, i.e., values of type E in Result<T, E>.", "closed_by": {"login": "jsha", "id": 220205, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/220205?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha", "html_url": "https://github.com/jsha", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsha/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82283/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82283/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
