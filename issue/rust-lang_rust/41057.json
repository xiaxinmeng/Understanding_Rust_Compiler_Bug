However, @cramertj's first effort (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/40873) revealed that this is a bit more complicated than I thought at first. In particular the current regions are \"whole-crate\", but moving them to on-demand then introduces unacceptable dependency edges everywhere.\r\n\r\nI think the overall structure that we want is that one does not request the \"region maps\" for the entire crate, but rather for a particular function or item (probably a body, though currently closures would share a region maps with their containing function).\r\n\r\nThis is made somewhat more complex by the fact that the `RegionMaps` construction code is quite old and a bit complex. It has for example a whole bunch of ref-cells that I think are *primarily* just an artifact of it being old -- i.e., the mutations should all be occuring during the construction phase, and not later.\r\n\r\nAnother complicating factor is the fact that we intern code extents to a small integer. Currently this interning is done **globally** (i.e., across all functions). I think it'd be fine, however, to do that **locally** (i.e., have a distinct vector for each function). \r\n\r\nEach of the above complications can be refactored away -- probably! -- but it'll be non-trivial. It certainly makes sense to do this in phases. I'm not sure what those phases ought to be. Probably this:\r\n\r\n- Purge the refcells -- use `&mut` borrows during `middle::region::resolve_crate()` and otherwise the data should be immutable. If this fails, we should figure out why and refactor accordingly.\r\n- Once the refcells are gone, try to thread through an appropriate fn or body-id into every call, and restructure the data to be per-fn.\r\n- Once **that** is done, we can actually break the region map structure to be built \"on demand\" and do the construction per function.\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/41057/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/41057/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
