In that\r\ncase, you can use use `issue = \"none\"` in your initial implementation PR. The\r\nreviewer will ask you to open a tracking issue if they agree your feature can be\r\nadded without an RFC.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFeature gate: `#![feature(debug_non_exhaustive)]`\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for adding the ability to add an ellipsis to the end of the `Debug` representation of a struct, to indicate that the struct has more fields, but that these fields are not displayable. This involves adding the `finish_non_exhaustive` method to `DebugStruct`, that produces output like\r\n\r\n```text\r\nName { field1: value1, .. }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the `..` indicate that there are more hidden fields.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a short description of the feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor most library features, it'd be useful to include a summarized version of the public API.\r\n(E.g. just the public function signatures without their doc comments or implementation.)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// core::fmt\r\n\r\nimpl<'a, 'b: 'a> DebugStruct<'a, 'b> {\r\n    pub fn finish_non_exhaustive(&mut self) -> fmt::Result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor larger features, more steps might be involved.\r\nIf the feature is changed later, please add those PRs here as well.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66716\r\n- [x] Final commenting period (FCP): https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67364#issuecomment-798329578\r\n- [x] Stabilization PR: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83041\r\n- [x] Replace `.finish()` by `.finish_non_exhaustive()` within the standard library where it makes sense: #83558 #83561\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOnce the feature has gone through a few release cycles and there are no\r\nunresolved questions left, the feature might be ready for stabilization.\r\n\r\nIf this feature didn't go through the RFC process, a final commenting period\r\n(FCP) is always needed before stabilization. This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncommenting period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Should this method be implemented for `DebugTuple` and `DebugMap` as well?\r\n   - I would probably say \"no\" since I can't think of any use cases for them. They could always be added later.", "closed_by": {"login": "m-ou-se", "id": 783247, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc4MzI0Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/783247?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se", "html_url": "https://github.com/m-ou-se", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/67364/reactions", "total_count": 23, "+1": 22, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/67364/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
