The most straightforward way to write diagnostics to `stderr` is\r\n>\r\n>     writeln!(io::stderr(), \"out of cheese error\").unwrap();\r\n>\r\n> which is significantly more typing in itself, requires you to `use std::io::Write`, and doesn't have `println!`'s defensive measures against being called at an awkward moment.\r\n>\r\n> The simplest thing we could possibly add to fix this problem would be an `eprintln!` macro, which would be exactly the same as `println!` except that the output goes to stderr instead of stdout.\r\n>\r\n> All of the documentation should also be updated to make it clear that it is inappropriate to use `println!` for error messages.\r\n\r\n\u2026 which met with general approval and two people saying they already were adding `eprintln!` to all their own crates, so I'm just gonna go ahead and submit a PR.  `eprint!` is included for completeness and symmetry; I'm not sure it's _useful_, but I think people would be surprised to find it missing.", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39228/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39228/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
