The gist of it is this: Debuginfo can be very large (gigabytes) and can contain lots of relocations, so the linker will spend a lot of time copying and relocating it into the final executable. \"Split DWARF\" is an approach that allows to basically skip this linker step: Since debuginfo is already located in the individual object files generated during compilation, why not just \"link\" to the debuginfo in there and let the debugger do any relocations on demand. This can potentially mean a drastic reduction of compile times for builds with debuginfo.\n\nLLVM already supports this on Linux, as far as I know, and it might be a good fit for incremental compilation where the linker could easily become the most time-consuming step (although that might be nixed by using `gold`'s incremental linking feature).\n\nIt might also be interesting for providing pre-built debuginfo separately via `*.dwp` files.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34651/reactions", "total_count": 27, "+1": 25, "-1": 0, "laugh": 2, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/34651/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
