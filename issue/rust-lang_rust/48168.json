This is intended to be a checklist/tracking issue of sorts of the work needed to be done to enable this.\r\n\r\n* [x] One of the first things we'll need to do is to add it to the Rust source tree (off by default). This will probably involve adding a submodule and adding rustbuild logic to build LLDB. This will currently, as of this writing, require syncing the LLDB work to get based off the same LLVM version we have in tree, presently the `release_60` branch.\r\n* [x] Next up we'll want to confirm that LLDB works with `sccache` and is being cached properly when using sccache. The change here would basically be ensuring that `--enable-ccache` works for LLDB locally.\r\n* [x] After that we'll want to build LLDB on the dist bots, but not upload it yet. This'll help us evaluate impacts on cycle time, if any. The change here should mostly just be tweaking flags in travis/appveyor/dockerfiles\r\n* [x] Next we'd add rustbuild support for creating a new LLDB component that we'd publish on the dist bots. This would probably look similar to the support for RLS (ish).\r\n* [ ] And finally we'd teach rustup.rs about the LLDB component, allowing `rustup component add lldb` (or whatever the name is), but this is much farther down the line!", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48168/reactions", "total_count": 20, "+1": 20, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48168/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
