For example, we could generate `nop`'s for such initializers, and then  give the `nop`'s corresponding debug info. But that is also pessimizing the code generation to accommodate beginners.\r\n\r\nThis is something we need to make a decision on whether it is an actual bug we would like to fix or not.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97083/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97083/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
