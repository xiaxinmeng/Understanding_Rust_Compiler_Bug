It uses the [Z3 theorem prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) as part of its implementation. Z3 uses C++, and is often used precompiled.\r\n\r\nMIRAI also links against rustc. This means that Z3's C++ library conflicts with the libstdc++ linked into rustc (well, libLLVM I think). At best this generates GB of linker errors, at worst something that seems to build but behaves erratically at runtime.\r\n\r\nIs there some way to hide all llvm's C++ symbols so that it just becomes an internal implementation details, and a second libstdc++ can coexist in the same address space? Alternatively could it be distributed with a shared libstdc++ so that llvm and Z3 are using a common library?\r\n\r\nI can solve this by building everything from source against the same libstdc++, but its a large burden to build rustc from source just to use MIRAI.\r\n\r\ncc @hermanventer @alexcrichton ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63920/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63920/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
