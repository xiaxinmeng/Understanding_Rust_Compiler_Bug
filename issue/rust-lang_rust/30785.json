The motivation is that, currently, deprecation goes into effect immediately, even though in some cases the replacement for the deprecated item hasn't hit the stable channel yet. By \"timing\" the deprecation to a given release, we can make the decision and land the replacement, and have it automatically go into effect at the right time.\n\nThe idea would be that the deprecation does not warn until the compiler version is at least the version labeling the deprecation.\n\nWe could also pipe this information into rustdoc, to give a heads up on the forthcoming deprecation.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30785/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 2, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30785/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
