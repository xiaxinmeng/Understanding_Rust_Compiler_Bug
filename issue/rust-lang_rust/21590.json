However, if those objects are pointers and the pointed-to objects are different sizes, it will not complain.\n\nThis was an issue in Servo because we had two structs that were identical before a Rust upgrade, but after a Rust upgrade some smart pointer-related optimizations changed the layout of one of the structs, resulting in a silent memory corruption. The solution was to add a `NonZero` wrapper to one of the raw pointers within the structs to disable the compiler optimization (https://github.com/servo/servo/commit/f400d79dbe307eef250329a40ef18ce7c840edf8), but this feels fragile.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21590/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21590/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
