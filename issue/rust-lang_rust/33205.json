A relatively important, and relatively easy target to translate to is WebAssembly.\n\nThe right starting strategy per @eddyb is to fork [miri](https://github.com/tsion/miri) and prototype the new backend out of tree.\n\nOne interesting point that @kripken brought up recently is that wasm is an AST with controlflow, whereas MIR is just a graph of blocks. This means that _somebody_ has to \"reloop\" the controlflow back out of the graph. Most likely [binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen), the C++ tool that\nconsumes wasm, will just _additionally_ accept a basic-block form of wasm and do the conversion itself.\n\n@kripken is interested in helping with this, so I'm setting up this issue as a place for interested parties to discuss.\n\ncc @tsion @nagisa\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33205/reactions", "total_count": 60, "+1": 38, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 22, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33205/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
