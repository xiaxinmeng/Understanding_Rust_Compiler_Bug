The `rustdoc` binary does not usually end up with a direct dependency on LLVM, so it doesn't _really_ need that `-lLLVM` at all.\r\n\r\nThe problem in #40717 went away once we started loading codegen dynamically in #47671. However, #67077 started linking LLVM directly again, and this just reached stable 1.41.\r\n\r\nMy former workaround of setting `LIBRARY_PATH=$(llvm-config --libdir)` still works. This is specifically the compile-time link path, not the runtime `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Maybe we could kludge that into rustbuild somehow?", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/68714/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/68714/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
