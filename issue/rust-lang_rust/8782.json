Unfortunately, 303f650ecfb5580f3d89aa662fbd164b849c8eff doesn't compile, so, I can't be quite sure. The revision before that, c178b52fe594c6724d0cf9124665de7e627899a9, is fine. I've also tested it against current master, 1ac7d809af161abc7fb73d76bae4fd0fb2a4826d.\n\nI don't have a small test case that demonstrates the issue. All I have is a large one. Check out the \"performance-regression\" branch of https://github.com/DaGenix/rust-working and then run the benchmark on the test.rc file - the relevant item is aes::bench::aes_bench_x8 (there is lots of messy code in there; I apologize for that, I use that repository mostly as a backup for my main computer).\n\nAll tests were run with --opt-level 3 on a Core i5 under 64-bit Ubuntu. Performance is likely drastically different on an architecture where LLVM can't use the SSE instructions, so, I don't know how well this reproduces outside of x86_64.\n\nc178b52fe594c6724d0cf9124665de7e627899a9 (last fast revision):\n\n```\n83.49 MB/s\n```\n\n0479d946c83cf9ed90bba5b33820ea4118dd8f9e (first slow revision that compiles):\n\n```\n80.60 MB/s\n```\n\n1ac7d809af161abc7fb73d76bae4fd0fb2a4826d (current master):\n\n```\n79.60 MB/s\n```\n\nHere is where it gets interesting: the code being benchmarked is mostly just the contents of the aessafe.rs file. I took code from that file and everything it depends on and moved it into a single file at: https://gist.github.com/DaGenix/6348471. When I benchmark this file using master, I get the faster (83.71 MB/s) performance.\n\nThis certainly isn't the ideal test case for this issue, although I'm not sure how to chop down the code to get a better test case at this point.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8782/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8782/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
