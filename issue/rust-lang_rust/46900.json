I would go with the github style, because it's looks nice and clean without any padding. Maybe one could increase the font size.\r\n\r\nI would also do a PR, but I wanted to discuss the style before I do that.\r\n\r\nSo, what are your thoughts? Do you have any different style in mind? To which elements should the rule apply? To all \\<kbd\\> tags or just tags inside a `docblock`?
