We wish to reserve the flexibility to change a few aspects:\n1. Move to variadic generics in place of auto-tupling.\n2. Change the `A` and `R` arguments from input types to (possibly) associated types. (cc #20871)\n3. Improve the coherence story with respect to fn-trait hierarchy. (cc #18835)\n\nTo this end we will adjust the features to:\n- [ ] Disallow references to the `Fn*` traits using angle bracket notation\n- [x] Disallow user impls of the `Fn*` traits\n- [x] Disallow direct calls to `foo.call()`\n- [x] Disallow parenthetical notation (`Foo(A,B) -> C`) from being used with anything other than the `Fn*` traits\n\nIn short, we permit unboxed closures to be used as if they are a language builtin, but disallow (for now) a lot of the more generic uses. We should be able to drop this feature gate shortly after 1.0.\n\ncc @pcwalton\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18875/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18875/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
