It was previously reported about a year ago here https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/issues/6325 and here https://github.com/mozilla/grcov/issues/502, but the root issue is in `rustc`. What follows is a minimal reproduction._\r\n\r\nFor some reason a crate that depends on `failure` fails to compile when `-Clink-dead-code` is set, but only on Windows. It works fine when `RUSTFLAGS` is empty, or on Linux.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, run the following commands in Powershell on Windows, in an empty folder:\r\n\r\n```ps1\r\ncargo init\r\necho 'failure=\"0.1.8\"' >> Cargo.toml\r\n$env:RUSTFLAGS=\"-Clink-dead-code\"\r\ncargo build\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error printed is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror[E0463]: can't find crate for `failure_derive`\r\n  --> C:\\Users\\Karel\\.cargo\\registry\\src\\github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823\\failure-0.1.8\\src\\lib.rs:56:1\r\n   |\r\n56 | extern crate failure_derive;\r\n   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ can't find crate\r\n\r\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0463`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `cargo clean` followed by `cargo build -vv` has this output: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/KarelPeeters/e5436e18e618dc23a55b9e77ed3c9279/raw/1f4bc3bc76a8e4e52175138a01ee51a1046c4387/gistfile1.txt\r\n\r\nThis doesn't happen for most crates, I have about 20 dependencies and this issue only comes up with `failure`/`failure_derive` for me. In the first issue someone else had the same problem with `const_fn = \"0.4.2\"`, but I cannot reproduce that.\r\n\r\nI tried my own issue on today's stable `rustc 1.55.0 (c8dfcfe04 2021-09-06)` and nightly `rustc 1.58.0-nightly (bd41e09da 2021-10-18)` and both Windows and Linux, and this happens for both versions on Windows and for neither version on Linux.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90056/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90056/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
