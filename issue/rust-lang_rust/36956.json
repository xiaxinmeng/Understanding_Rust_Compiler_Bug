Currently it is not possible to generate code coverage information from documentation tests. This results in either wrong coverage information being generated (when some functionality is tested exclusively in documentation tests). The current workarounds are unfortunately to either duplicate documentation tests into module tests to generate correct code coverage information, or to \"accept\" wrong code coverage information in e.g. coveralls. \n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36956/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36956/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
