I just want rustc to give me an error message instead of deadlocking. :)\r\n\r\nI found this while trying to make a version of Servo without JavaScript. I started by deleting all references to mozjs from .toml files and deleting all \"use js::*\" lines from .rs files. That *should* cause the compile to fail almost right away with compile errors. Instead, rustc just hangs when it reaches the \"script\" crate.\r\n\r\n**OS and RustC version**\r\nThis is 64-bit Linux Mint 18, corresponding to Ubuntu 16.04. My rustc version is rustc 1.23.0 (766bd11c8 2018-01-01).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n- Check out this branch of Servo: https://github.com/Max-E/servo/tree/stripped_out\r\n- compile with \"./mach build -rv\"\r\n\r\n**Expected Results**\r\nCompilation should fail as soon as it hits the \"script\" crate with a huge number of error messages.\r\n\r\n**Actual Results**\r\nrustc just hangs. Instead of the expected CPU utilization (8 threads going full blast) there is only one thread. When I attach gdb to the rustc process, I see only two threads. One thread is stuck on a pthread_join, and another thread is in a loop that seems to call memcmp a lot.\r\n\r\n**A Second Opinion**\r\nA very kind bystander on IRC was able to reproduce the same problem using both the stable and nightly versions of rustc.\r\n\r\n**An Apology**\r\nI wish I could narrow down the problem instead of just dumping this huge codebase on you, but I frankly am not sure how to even begin doing that.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47564/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47564/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
