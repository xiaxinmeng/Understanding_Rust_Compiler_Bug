Generally, the only new language features added after this milestone must be backwards compatible, or to fix soundness holes, though we do expect to have some leeway to make small incompatible fixes that have low impact on existing code bases.\r\n\r\n* Library stability - We have a system of measuring and ensuring the stability of API's, and a significant portion of the standard library is declared stable. Stable API's will not change. Large portions of the standard library need to be stable for 1.0, including primitive types, vectors, strings, option, numerics, collections, some I/O and concurrency.\r\n\r\n* User experience - The system is polished and the presentation is complete and professional. New users have a clear path to using and learning the system. This encompasses the web site, documentation, installation, and tooling.\r\n", "creator": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 376, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2013-10-10T18:48:33Z", "updated_at": "2016-08-28T23:13:24Z", "due_on": "2015-05-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2015-05-21T20:59:13Z"}, "comments": 15, "created_at": "2013-06-12T17:48:50Z", "updated_at": "2014-08-04T16:11:39Z", "closed_at": "2014-08-04T16:11:39Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "It's time to handle another one of the hardest things in computer science, how to name conversion functions. Rust supports essentially three ways of converting from one type to another. First there is doing a copy, such as these in the `str` mod:\n\n```\npub fn from_bytes(vv: &[u8]) -> ~str { ... }\n\npub trait StrSlice<'self> {\n     fn to_str(&self) -> ~str { ... }\n     fn to_owned(&self) -> ~str { ...}\n}\n```\n\nThen we have some that can do a no-allocation moves, such as `either`'s:\n\n```\npub fn to_result<T, U>(eith: Either<T, U>) -> Result<U, T> { ... }\n```\n\nFinally, we have ones that can get a no-copy reference, as in `str`'s:\n\n```\npub fn from_bytes_with_null<'a>(vv: &'a [u8]) -> &'a str { ... }\n\npub trait StrSlice<'self> {\n    fn as_bytes(&self) -> &'self [u8]\n}\n```\n\nWhile they share similar names, it's not consistent what exactly is happening in each case. I would like to standardize on a style so I can know how to name things for the standard library.\n\nSome options that came up in IRC are:\n- `as` for conversions, and `to` for moves or copies. Simple, but then we end up with functions named like `to_str_consume` to distinguish between the two cases, which is a little ugly.\n- `as` for conversions, `to` for moves, and `into` for copies. This is nice in that we try to push users to use our no-copy solutions, but this will make `.to_str` a little more ugly.\n- `as` for conversions, `to` for copies, and `into` for moves. This keeps `.to_str` pretty, but people might tend to the copy functions instead of the moves.\n- Use a standard trait for conversions, as in #7080. This won't help when we have options for how to convert. For example, `from_bytes_slice<'a>(vector: &'a [u8]) -> &'a str` which handles byte slices that don't end with a null character, or  `str::from_bytes_with_null<'a>(vv: &'a [u8]) -> &'a str` which does.\n\nAnyone have an opinion on what we should use?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "aturon", "id": 709807, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTgwNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/709807?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon", "html_url": "https://github.com/aturon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7087/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7087/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
