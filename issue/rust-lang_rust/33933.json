[it worked for Dart](http://blog.dantup.com/2014/09/dart-vm-on-a-chromebook-without-linux/)). I've never used it before so it's likely I'm doing something silly, but I'm not sure how to diagnose (I can't find any instructions for installing from the tar.gz, and `rustup` fails ue to no `file` command on my Chromebook).\n- I downloaded the [64bit Linux 1.9.0 tar.gz](https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-1.9.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz)\n- I extracted to `/home/chronos/user/Downloads/Rust/rust-1.9.0/`\n- I added `/home/chronos/user/Downloads/Rust/rust-1.9.0/rustc/bin/` and `/home/chronos/user/Downloads/Rust/rust-1.9.0/cargo/bin/` to `PATH`\n- I added `/home/chronos/user/Downloads/Rust/rust-1.9.0/rustc/lib/` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`\n- I copied the Hello World code and ran `rustc test.rs`\n\nHere's some console output:\n\n```\nchronos@localhost ~/Downloads/Rust/HelloWorld $ echo $PATH\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/opt/bin:/home/chronos/user/Downloads/Rust/rust-1.9.0/rustc/bin/:/home/chronos/user/Downloads/Rust/rust-1.9.0/cargo/bin/\n\nchronos@localhost ~/Downloads/Rust/HelloWorld $ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH \n/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib64:/home/chronos/user/Downloads/Rust/rust-1.9.0/rustc/lib/\n\nchronos@localhost ~/Downloads/Rust/HelloWorld $ rustc --version\nrustc 1.9.0 (e4e8b6668 2016-05-18)\n\nchronos@localhost ~/Downloads/Rust/HelloWorld $ rustc test.rs \nerror: can't find crate for `std` [E0463]\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n```\n\nI'm guessing there's more I need to do ([rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.sh/blob/master/rustup.sh) is huge and I only did a few things), but I can't find any details anywhere. Is setting it up manually feasible? I found [this issue](https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-make/issues/213) that is the same error but there was a comment from @didrocks that suggests it was a bug with the Rust release that has since been fixed (though whether he means Rust here or an Ununtu package, I'm not sure).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "DanTup", "id": 1078012, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgwMTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1078012?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanTup", "html_url": "https://github.com/DanTup", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanTup/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33933/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33933/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
