As such, it launches many subprocesses. For every subprocess, it spawns a thread that runs `std::process::Command::spawn()`.\r\n\r\nOn macOS, `ninja -j250` runs fine, while `n2 -j250` runs out of file descriptors (n2 bug report: https://github.com/evmar/n2/issues/14). It looks like this is due to an FD leak in rust's standard library.\r\n\r\nCommand::spawn() in the rust stdlib unconditionally calls anon_pipe here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/521734787ecf80ff12df7ca5998f7ec0b3b7b2c9/library/std/src/sys/unix/process/process_unix.rs#L59\r\n\r\nanon_pipe on Linux calls pipe2 to set CLOEXEC on the pipe atomically: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/521734787ecf80ff12df7ca5998f7ec0b3b7b2c9/library/std/src/sys/unix/pipe.rs#L18\r\n\r\nBut macOS has no pipe2, so here the stdlib instead calls pipe() followed by set_cloexec: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/521734787ecf80ff12df7ca5998f7ec0b3b7b2c9/library/std/src/sys/unix/pipe.rs#L35\r\n\r\nThis means there's a window where the pipe is created but cloexec isn't set on the pipe's FDs yet. If a different thread forks in that window, the pipe's fds get leaked.\r\n\r\nThe FD leak went away when putting `std::process::Command::spawn()` behind a mutex, so it does seem like this race is in fact the cause.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn the n2 issue, @bnoordhuis remarks \"Just throwing it out there: libstd uses posix_spawn() under the right conditions (instead of fork + execve) and macOS has a POSIX_SPAWN_CLOEXEC_DEFAULT attribute that does what its name suggests. Teaching libstd about it probably isn't too hard.\" This might be a possible venue for a fix on macOS, but it's possible to imagine a program that depends on some FDs staying open, and I don't know if there's a way to make POSIX_SPAWN_CLOEXEC_DEFAULT apply only to the 2 fds returned by pipe().", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/95584/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/95584/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
