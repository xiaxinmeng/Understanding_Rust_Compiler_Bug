I'm a maintainer of [quick-xml](https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml) and I setup a [coverage](https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml/pull/391) for it and collect coverage, using `RUSTFLAGS: -C instrument-coverage`.\r\n\r\nHowever, results on codecov.io looks very strange:\r\n- many lines are marked as not covered while they contains simple doc comments even without doctests. The most striking example of a file in which there is no executable code at all, but it is all marked as not covered: https://app.codecov.io/gh/tafia/quick-xml/blob/master/src/lib.rs\r\n- non-executable code, such as `use`s or `mod` declarations marked as not covered (in the same place)\r\n- sometimes coverage looks like it started and ended at random lines: some examples in https://app.codecov.io/gh/tafia/quick-xml/blob/master/src/de/mod.rs\r\n- code of module tests (i.e. in `#[cfg(test)]` modules) are also included in coverage which is unexpected, for example: https://app.codecov.io/gh/tafia/quick-xml/blob/master/src/de/mod.rs. That code should be used to _produce_ coverage, not _for_ coverage. This seriously biases the results, especially when you have more lines with tests than with code itself.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n\r\nThe coverage is collected by GitHub `ubuntu-latest` runner, currently it reports Rust 1.64.0, but the issue was there since coverage was added to quick-xml, i.e. at least since 2022-05-30.
