This means that when rustc sees an `extern crate` it then searches those directories. It's good to have the ability to test that behavior, but it's not the way that cargo drives rustc -- and as a result it's not compatible with the new extern-prelude feature set, requiring [awkward run-make tests like extern-prelude](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/run-make-fulldeps/extern-prelude/Makefile). \r\n\r\nIt would probably be better for compiletest, by default, to add a `--extern foo=<path-to-foo>` flag for each auxiliary crate. We could maybe keep a way to use the \"auxdir\" option.\r\n\r\ncc @petrochenkov @zackmdavis @nrc @qmx ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52428/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52428/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
