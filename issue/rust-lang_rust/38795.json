This fails if `<path>` contains commas, because `-Wl,` separates options on commas, so the linker ends up getting a bad path and spurious extra parameters.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to use `-Xlinker` which passes the next option through literally, so the full rpath can be specified with `-Wl,-rpath -Xlinker <path,with,commas>`. The `-Xlinker` form is fairly verbose, and only needed when there are commas.\r\n\r\n(This comes up when building with [Buck](https://buckbuild.com), because it generates paths of the form `base/path/file.o#flavor1,flavor2` where \"flavors\" are things like \"shared\", \"static\", \"pic\", etc.)", "closed_by": {"login": "jsgf", "id": 147966, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0Nzk2Ng==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147966?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf", "html_url": "https://github.com/jsgf", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38795/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38795/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
