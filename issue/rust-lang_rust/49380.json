This crate currently is its own crate due to these requirements: its object file needs to appear at the end of the linker argument list and it needs be marked with the `#![compiler_builtins]` attribute (symbol visibility, etc.).\r\n\r\nOn `#![no_std]` `compiler-builtins` needs to appear in the dependency graph to avoid linker errors but that requires the `#[feature(compiler_builtins_lib)]` feature gate because the crate is unstable -- it's a compiler implementation detail.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to put the compiler intrinsics into `core` and eliminate the `compiler-builtins` crate from the `std` facade. This has become possible thanks to recent progress in multiple codegen units.\r\n\r\n### What roughly needs to be done\r\n\r\n- Include `compiler-builtins` as source code into `core` using something like `#[path = \"../compiler-builtins/src/lib.rs\"] mod intrinsics`.\r\n\r\n- Create some attribute to mark the whole `intrinsics` module as `#![compiler_builtins]`  and to force the whole module to be into its own codegen unit so it gets its own object file.\r\n\r\ncc @michaelwoerister  @eddyb @alexcrichton", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/49380/reactions", "total_count": 8, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 5, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/49380/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
