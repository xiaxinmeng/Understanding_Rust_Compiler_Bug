   // glob would also work\n```\n\nDocument crate `beta` and take a look at the generated pages of `Tr` and `Ty`:\nYou should be able to actually **see** the associated type `Assoc` in the `impl` block despite being **marked as hidden**. You probably need to click `[+]` (_expand_) first.\nThe `impl` block I refer to is in section\n\n* _Implementors_ on the trait page and in section\n* _Trait Implementations_ on the implementor's page.\n\nIt should be noted that even though `Assoc` wrongly shows up in those `impl` blocks, it is indeed not shown in the code block at the start of the trait page \u2013 at the \u201cdefinition site\u201d if you will (compared to the \u201cuse sites\u201d \u2013 the `impl` blocks).\n\nIt is **crucial** that the trait and the type are defined inside of an external crate. If they were defined in the \u201ccurrent\u201d crate, this bug would not occur: The hidden associated items would not be shown.\nYou can check this for yourself by\n\n* documenting `alpha` on its own and viewing its documentation separately, or by\n* re-exporting the crate `alpha` from `beta` (e.g. with `pub use alpha;`) and then documenting `beta`:\n  * On the page for `alpha::Tr`, the associated item is hidden\n  * On the page for the re-export `beta::Tr`, however, the associated item is displayed\n\n---\n\n[I've discovered this bug in a PR of mine](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95316#issuecomment-1079737208 ) after a CI job failed because the linkchecker complained about broken links in the standard library when documenting it with a modified rustdoc. The broken links are not relevant for this bug, they are mere symptoms of it: If everything was properly hidden, no broken links would ever be generated.\n\nThis bug currently **affects the standard library documentation** (for stable and nightly) as mentioned in the linked comment.\nIn this case,\n\n* the trait is [`SupportedLaneCount`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/simd/trait.SupportedLaneCount.html)\n* the type is [`LaneCount`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/simd/struct.LaneCount.html)\n* the associated type that shouldn't be shown is `BitMask`\n* crate \u201calpha\u201d is `core`\n* crate \u201cbeta\u201d is `std`\n\n---\n\n@rustbot label T-rustdoc A-cross-crate-reexports\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"fmease\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/95717/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/95717/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
