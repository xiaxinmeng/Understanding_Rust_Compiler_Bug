This does not happen without -O.\n\nFrankly... this is a mess.  When I tried to reduce the code in even small ways, the blowup stopped happening: making `i_phi` `#[inline(never)]` reduces the _total_ size of the binary by some 60K, while changing the implementation of `get` to `unimplemented!()` drastically reduces the size of `do_insn` _even if it's marked `inline(never)`_.  Faced with this, I'm not really sure what to do other than post the random WIP crappy code I'm working on and hope that a general issue can be identified without looking too closely.  I know this is the worst possible thing to receive as a bug report, but for now that's the best I can do.\n\nIs there any way to `inline(never)` drop glue?  If not, it would be nice to have.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/comex/24abeab6b99680b045ca contains the Hex-Rays output, the source code (although it will not build without other files), and the LLVM IR produced with -O.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18864/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18864/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
