I don't see a way to take advantage of the view code feature without having to wait for the slow open animation and then the slow close animation between file navigations. It seems like there is no way to avoid clicking the open/close button twice for every new file searched.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1505488/153220612-5711ebb2-0fc5-4013-b77d-bca37da98411.png)\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "spacejam", "id": 1505488, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDU0ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505488?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacejam", "html_url": "https://github.com/spacejam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacejam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacejam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacejam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacejam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacejam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacejam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacejam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacejam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spacejam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93812/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93812/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
