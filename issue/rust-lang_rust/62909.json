My main motivation was to clearly see what `f64` methods are available in `core` alone, under `#[no_std]`, since a lot of them require `std` and `libm` support. However, I had trouble making that work because of broken documentation links between `core` and `std`-specific methods.\r\n\r\nSo I think instead, `rustdoc` could put some kind of marker on primitive methods to indicate what crate added them, so the accessibility is known. Apart from floating point, there are also a few slice methods that are only added in `alloc`. Maybe there are more that I don't know yet!", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62909/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62909/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
