He finds the module responsible for the feature he wants to enhance, and... that's it. Now he have to understand the whole module before he will be able to start working on it.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is the following:\r\n\r\nAdd a `README.md` to each crate (of course, not all at the same time) which will contain the following information:\r\n\r\n- Short overview of the purpose of the crate.\r\n- Core entry points (e.g., exposed public interfaces).\r\n- Short description of modules in the crate, if they are has significant logical meaning.\r\n- Optionally: some hints for developing in this module.\r\n- Optionally: list of persons who are responsible for this module, so developers will know who they should be requesting a review from.\r\n\r\nWith such a file, entry threshold will be much lower and (I believe) getting into `rust` development will become easier.\r\n\r\nFrom my side, I can try to implement such a `README.md` for `libtest` (as I'm familiar with it).\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "rylev", "id": 1327285, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjcyODU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1327285?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rylev", "html_url": "https://github.com/rylev", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rylev/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rylev/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rylev/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rylev/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rylev/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rylev/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rylev/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rylev/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rylev/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/issues/474/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/issues/474/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
