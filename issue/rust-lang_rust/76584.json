That xcrun failure is a hard failure.\r\n\r\nAs stated in https://github.com/rust-lang/docs.rs/issues/1040, a workaround for at least generating documentation is to provide `SDKROOT` with a path to an empty directory to `iPhoneOS.platform`.\r\n\r\nNo such issue occurs on `*-apple-darwin` because an entirely different codepath is taken.\r\n\r\nI am not sure of the right course of action to fix this:\r\n\r\n1. Change ios and tvos targets to not require `pre_link_flag`s to be set, like macOS, and let build failures occur after printing a warning so the user can at least fix the issue\r\n1. Add a hack for `doc` so that at least docs.rs can generate documentation for ios\r\n1. Don't change this behaviour at all, but fix the error message so that cross-compiling devs won't just stare blindly at their screen asking \"why me\"\r\n\r\nMy preference is for the first option, and I'm quite happy to contribute a fix for it, though I would need assistance in successfully cross-compiling rustc for macOS from Linux. \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt is probable that this is the same issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/42084.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76584/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76584/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
