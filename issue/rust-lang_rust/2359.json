I had a library depending on three other libraries. The external libraries were copied into a local project/bin directory so that I had more control over them.\n\nThis was all working fine until I decided to rename my project. As part of this process I removed my bin directory and copied new versions of the external libraries into bin. Now when I do `rustc --out-dir bin -L bin -O src/rwebserve.rc` I get:\n\n```\nsrc/rwebserve.rc:11:0: 11:42 error: duplicate definition of module socket\nsrc/rwebserve.rc:11 use socket (name = \"socket\", vers = \"0.1\");\n```\n\nIf I change the use statement to \"use socketXXX\" I get the same error which makes me think that it is not a duplicate definition (and I don't see how it would be). My guess is that this is caused when using libraries built by slightly different versions of rustc. Unfortunately I now get an ICE trying to build one of the libraries so I can't try it out atm (currently building a new rustc in the hopes that that will fix the ICE).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pcwalton", "id": 157897, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton", "html_url": "https://github.com/pcwalton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2359/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2359/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
