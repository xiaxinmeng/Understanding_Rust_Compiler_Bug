It's equivalent to `Vec::drain` if you consider a `Vec<T>` to be a `BTreeMap<usize, T>` with consecutive keys. It's not equivalent to the `HashMap::drain()` without argument, and `BTreeMap::drain(..)` doesn't compile without a type annotation [if the key type has additional `Borrow` implementations](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/is-btreemap-range-incompletely-defined/54107), whereas `Vec::drain(..)` is always a simple way to drain everything.\r\n- An efficient implementation of draining implies most of the drained key-value pairs are in entirely preserved (and not even visited) subtrees. Therefore, the return value can be relatively easily adapted to obtain a range-based method much like `split_off`. Is it OK to add `split_off_range` along the way?\r\n\r\n### Implementation history\r\n- First real shot: #81075\r\n- Early attempt at argumentless `drain`: #66747", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/81074/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/81074/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
