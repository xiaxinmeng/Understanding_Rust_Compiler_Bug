I want to have windowed mode binaries for GUI applications, since without the windowed mode flag the binary will spawn a visible console window in addition to the GUI window every time it's run.\n\nPanicing threads seem to cause an unconditional print to stderr. I'm trying to write a panic handler that will pop up a Windows message dialog instead of printing to stdout when the program terminates with a panic, but currently can't do that because windowed mode programs die at the point of the panic and the handler is never reached.\n\nTo test this, write `panic.rs`:\n\n``` rust\nfn f() { panic!(\"This kills the Windows\"); }\n\nfn main() {\n    match std::thread::Builder::new().spawn(f).unwrap().join() {\n        Err(_) => { std::fs::File::create(\"panic_log.txt\"); }\n        _ => {}\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBuild it with `rustc -C link-args=-mwindows panic.rs`. Then run `panic.exe` _from the Windows explorer_. The program terminates and the `panic_log.txt` file never shows up. (It does seem to work if you run it from the Command Prompt, but end users will be clicking an icon.)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25643/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25643/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
