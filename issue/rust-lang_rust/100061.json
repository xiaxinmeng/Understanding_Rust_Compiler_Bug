Some of these are exclusively used by rustc_mir_transform, so they could go there. Some are also used by rustc_borrowck, so I am not sure what the best location is for them. I just know `rustc_const_eval` is definitely wrong. :)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100061/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100061/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
