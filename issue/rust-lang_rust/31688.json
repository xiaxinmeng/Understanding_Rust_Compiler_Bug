Currently I would rather expect that call_once will execute the closure\nonly once, whether it panics or not. But this is not what happens:\n\n``` rust\n#![feature(recover)]\n\nuse std::sync::*;\nuse std::panic::recover;\n\nstatic ONCE : Once = ONCE_INIT;\n\nfn main() {\n    for i in 1..10 {\n        let _ = recover(|| { \n            ONCE.call_once(|| {\n                let s = if i > 1 { \"s\" } else { \"\"};\n                panic!(\"Once::call_once called {} time{}\", i, s);\n            }); \n        });\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPrints:\n\n```\nthread '<main>' panicked at 'Once::call_once called 1 time', <anon>:13\nnote: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.\nthread '<main>' panicked at 'Once::call_once called 2 times', <anon>:13\nthread '<main>' panicked at 'Once::call_once called 3 times', <anon>:13\nthread '<main>' panicked at 'Once::call_once called 4 times', <anon>:13\nthread '<main>' panicked at 'Once::call_once called 5 times', <anon>:13\nthread '<main>' panicked at 'Once::call_once called 6 times', <anon>:13\nthread '<main>' panicked at 'Once::call_once called 7 times', <anon>:13\nthread '<main>' panicked at 'Once::call_once called 8 times', <anon>:13\nthread '<main>' panicked at 'Once::call_once called 9 times', <anon>:13\n```\n\nEither way documentation needs a slight improvement. And additionally code if\nit is not a desired behaviour. As a side comment I will note that this\nbehaviour differs between languages. In C++ for example std::call_once to\nproceed must not exit via exception, in Go on the other hand exiting via panic\ncounts as successful execution.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31688/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31688/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
