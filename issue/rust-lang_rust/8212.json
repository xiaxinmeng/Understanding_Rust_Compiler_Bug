I fixed the `offset` family of functions in the `ptr` module but vectors are a bit problematic.\n\nVector iterators use a pointer to the start and a pointer one byte past the end, so an iteration of the loop is just an increment (or decrement, in reverse) of a pointer and a comparison between the start and end.\n\nSince zero-size types can be stored in vectors, it currently uses `nonzero_size_of` to increment the pointer instead of the optimized `offset` functions - otherwise iterating of a vector of 11 zero-size types would stop _immediately_ instead of looping 11 times. This can likely be fixed by special-casing the iterator for zero-size types.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "huonw", "id": 1203825, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDM4MjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1203825?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw", "html_url": "https://github.com/huonw", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/huonw/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8212/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8212/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
