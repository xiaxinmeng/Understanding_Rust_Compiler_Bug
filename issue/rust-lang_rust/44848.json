Currently, if a ref-binding is included, this disables coercion for `let` statements and tweaks how we handle `match` statements. It's unclear precisely what we ought to do now that `ref` bindings are not always syntactically visible. This issue exists to track the question.\r\n\r\nThere has already been a number of conversations on the topic. Here are some links for background reading:\r\n\r\n- @nikomatsakis commenting on [why we can probably get away with only considering syntactic bindings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/44614#issuecomment-331542696).\r\n- @arielb1's [response](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/44614#issuecomment-331908960) points out that we might want to consider [possible future behavior around `DerefPure`  as well](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/44614#issuecomment-331915262)\r\n- [Some follow-up discussion between @nikomatsakis and @arielb1 on gitter](https://gitter.im/rust-impl-period/WG-compiler-middle?at=59c92a8f19147ac3231745e6)\r\n- A [very early conversation on the topic](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/43399#discussion_r130223956).
