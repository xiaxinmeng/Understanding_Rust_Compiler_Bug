It was  then noticed that afterwards, every call to `to_socket_addrs` that requires a DNS lookup would fail from then on. However, trying the same DNS lookup on a new thread would work fine.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce this using just the standard library here:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::net::TcpStream;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let cnt = 30_000; // adjust for your system\r\n    let host = \"localhost:3000\"; // using \"127.0.0.1:3000\" doesn't have the same problem\r\n\r\n    let mut sockets = Vec::with_capacity(cnt);\r\n    for i in 0..cnt {\r\n        match TcpStream::connect(host) {\r\n            Ok(tcp) => sockets.push(tcp),\r\n            Err(e) => {\r\n                println!(\"error {} after {} connects\", e, i);\r\n                break;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    drop(sockets);\r\n    println!(\"closing all sockets\");\r\n\r\n    // sleep because why not\r\n    ::std::thread::sleep(::std::time::Duration::from_secs(5));\r\n\r\n    TcpStream::connect(host).unwrap();\r\n\r\n    println!(\"end\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust start up a local server, and try to run this program against it. Also, notice that if you change from `\"localhost\"` to `\"127.0.0.1\"`, the issue doesn't show up.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47955/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47955/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
