I'm porting erickt/rust-crypto to 0.4, and it has complicated enum variants like `AES_256_ECB`, which don't read nicely as `Aes256Ecb`. I ran into the same thing updating rust-elasticsearch, where I converted `DFS_QUERY_THEN_FETCH` to `DfsQueryThenFetch`, which made me sad.\n\n I heard @graydon has some reservations with this lint checker on by default, so I figure maybe we should talk this through if it's not a settled issue. What does the community think about turning this into an opt-in lint? Or if that ship has already sailed, what about allowing types, traits, and variants to have `_` in them?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3618/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3618/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
