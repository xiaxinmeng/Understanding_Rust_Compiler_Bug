[This comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/40338#issuecomment-290057507) pointed out some obvious problems. These bugs are going to be much easier to clean up than the initial PR was to land, though \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\nTo help with this work, I generated docs for both the commit before and the commit of, ran all the HTML files through [tidy-html5](https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5/), and put it up here: https://github.com/steveklabnik/docdiff/commit/ddda1fe51588755874bbfd331ecb134e79922596 the `'` -> `\"` changes are expected, but that tool doesn't have the ability to re-write those, so I left them in for now, which, frankly, makes the diff kinda large. working on it.\r\n\r\nHere's the stuff we've found so far:\r\n\r\n- [x] horizontal rules\r\n- [x] footnotes (waiting for pulldown update https://github.com/google/pulldown-cmark/pull/21)\r\n- [x] images\r\n- [x] `<br />` for `HardBreak`s\r\n- [x] the title part of links being rendered as visible text rather than as an attribute on the `<a>` tag (imperio update: I'll need an example to be able to fix this one)\r\n- [x]  `MarkdownHtml` now doing the same as `Markdown` when it should be escaping raw HTML.\r\n- [x] [some strange rendering](https://github.com/steveklabnik/docdiff/commit/ddda1fe51588755874bbfd331ecb134e79922596#diff-73ae1ced9c2ca5ba756a60f7b63b3e9dL785) around methods at times? rendered: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/collections/struct.LinkedList.html#method.front_place source https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/libcollections/linked_list.rs#L700 fix: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/41066\r\n- [x] In src/libstd/collections/hash/map.rs under \"Relevant papers/articles:\", it appears the ordered list has been rendered as an unordered list instead.
