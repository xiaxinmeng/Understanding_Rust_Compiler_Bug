(Not having libraries is fine, in fact that's the point of the musl target, and the `-pie` flag should just make it able to be loaded anywhere in memory, but having unresolved imports without dependencies is where it becomes problematic)\n\nSimilarly, grepping through the assembly, it looks like `__cxa_thread_atexit_impl` isn't called by anyone, but `__dso_handle` does show up in an external rust linkage symbol (I have no idea what the function of the `__rust_extern_with_linkage____X` is):\n\n```\n015:    48 8d 15 ec 7f 26 00    lea    0x267fec(%rip),%rdx        # 271008 <_rust_extern_with_linkage___dso_handle>\n```\n\nAs such, doesn't seem like it's a major problem, but it is very unusual, and again, the lack of dynamic library dependencies + unresolved symbol imports is a red flag, and should probably be investigated.  My guess is that there is some weird interaction with the `link-args` flag and the generated link commands somehow.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/32546/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/32546/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
