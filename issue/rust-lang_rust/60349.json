I think it the effort should be splitted and happen in several separate steps. \r\n\r\nThe first big step in it is replacing `libterm` with `termcolor`, which means:\r\n* Add separate features to `termcolor`, `wincolor`, and `winapi` to mark these crates unstable (so they can be shipped with rustc.\r\n* Maybe move these crates repo to `rust-lang` organization.\r\n* Modify libtest in-tree to use `termcolor`\r\n\r\nAn alternative is to keep the existing code for unstable rustc usage but make it a shim over `termcolor` for non-rustc usages.\r\n\r\nJust wrote these down to see what peoples think. @alexcrichton @Manishearth @gnzlbg @BurntSushi \r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60349/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60349/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
