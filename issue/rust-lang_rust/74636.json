This issue will track the fix for the regression, based on the [discussion in Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/216091-t-compiler.2Fwg-polymorphization/topic/tokio.20regression.20%28.2374614%29/near/204640191) (with thanks to @lcnr, @oli-obk and @eddyb).\r\n\r\n#74614 can be reduced to the following MCVE (`src/test/ui/issues/issue-74614.rs` after #74633):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn test<T>() { std::mem::size_of::<T>(); }\r\n\r\npub fn foo<T>(_: T) -> &'static fn() {\r\n    &(test::<T> as fn())\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn outer<T>() {\r\n    foo(|| ());\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    outer::<u8>();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`outer` is polymorphized because `T` is not used in `outer` or `outer::{{closure}}#0`. `outer::{{closure}}#0` therefore inherits `T` from `outer` and that ends up being `T` in `foo<T>`. \r\n\r\nWithout a transitive analysis (which isn't possible without hitting cycle errors), `outer` cannot consider `T` used based on how `outer::{{closure}}#0` is used in other functions.\r\n\r\nThere are two issues that this can cause - when that closure is used in a cast or when that closure is used in reflection.\r\n\r\nWhen used in a cast (as in the example above), the following lines will be hit:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e22b61bff0bdd08be7665607cb7be3748c8a35d2/src/librustc_mir/interpret/cast.rs#L49-L52\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e22b61bff0bdd08be7665607cb7be3748c8a35d2/src/librustc_mir/interpret/cast.rs#L91-L94\r\n\r\nUsing `still_further_specializable` instead of `needs_subst` here fixes the issue, as that flag isn't set for the parent substitutions of closures.\r\n\r\nWhen used in reflection (see the example below), then this will ICE once #74538 lands, but doesn't right now.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::any::TypeId;\r\n\r\npub fn foo<T: 'static>(_: T) -> TypeId {\r\n    TypeId::of::<T>()\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn outer<T: 'static>() {\r\n    foo(|| ());\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    outer::<u8>();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nReflection is more complicated because it makes the result of polymorphisation observable.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74636/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74636/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
