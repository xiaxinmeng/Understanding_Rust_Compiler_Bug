It's even more surprising in that it *only* works in functions marked either `#[test]` or `#[cfg(test)]`. If you put it on a regular function (just remove `#[test]` from above), you get the expected error:\r\n```\r\nerror[E0599]: no method named `to_vec` found for reference `&[u8; 5]` in the current scope\r\n --> src\\lib.rs:5:16\r\n  |\r\n5 |     let _v = b.to_vec();\r\n  |                ^^^^^^ method not found in `&[u8; 5]`\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected this error to also happen in `#[cfg(test)]`, but it doesn't. This is unexpected and surprising.\r\n\r\nWhat makes it even more surprising is that `alloc` isn't actually *in scope*, because if you change `let _v` to `let _v: alloc::Vec<_>` in the code above, you'll be told as much.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/99637/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/99637/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
