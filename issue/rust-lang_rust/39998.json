frustrating \u2013 because of the multitude of different `build.rs` scripts each configured in a different way, the build environment is fragile. Lately I made some changes to my environment, and since then, I've been trying to get all the native deps linking statically again \u2013 and some of them quite stubbornly refuse to do so.\r\n\r\nThe general problem with `build.rs` is hard to fix, but I think at least the process of troubleshooting the build could be made less frustrating. I'm thinking something like passing a flag to `cargo` or` rustc`, signalling that \"I'm expecting the build to be fully statically linked, so if some of the libraries passes dynamic linking flags, stop building and tell me the name of that traitor\".\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the build just silently accepts dynamic flags, resulting, after a long compilation, in a binary that I'm expecting to be able to run in an empty Linux userspace, but which fails. This is because `rustc` doesn't know my intent. Should we not be allowed to signal that intent?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39998/reactions", "total_count": 85, "+1": 85, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39998/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
