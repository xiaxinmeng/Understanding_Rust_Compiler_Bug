But this section precedes any discussion of traits (unless one takes the \"Learn Rust\" path, where they are briefly mentioned) at all in the book. At the very least it could link to the \"Traits\" chapter of the following section.\n\nAdmittedly, I've been reading TRPL by jumping between sections (because I already have a decent grasp of the language... I think :-)), so I may well have missed a \"suggested reading order\" in an introductory chapter that would ease my concerns. I did see the paragraph that suggests jumping to either of the \"Learn Rust\" or \"Syntax and Semantics\" sections, depending on one's preference, but nothing I could find gave a suggestion of where \"Effective Rust\" fits in the order of one's personal curriculum.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27510/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27510/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
