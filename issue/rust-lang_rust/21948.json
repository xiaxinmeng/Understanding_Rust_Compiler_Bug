This means that our JS structs of the form\n\n```\nstruct JSRef<T> {\nptr: *const T,\n...\n}\n```\n\nbecame\n\n```\nstruct JSRef<T> {\nptr: NonZero<*const T>,\n...\n}\n```\n\nIn the original system, `print ref.ptr` in `gdb` would nicely print a typed pointer (something like `(struct foo::bar::Baz<Quux>)* 0x12345` IIRC). Now, it gives us simply `{0x12345}`, and there doesn't seem to be a way to get the inner data out. This is quite annoying since we use these pointers everywhere in the DOM.\n\nThe larger issue here I guess is that anonymous fields can't be accessed as an expression in `gdb`. Perhaps naming them `.0`, `.1` explicitly would work?\n\ncc @michaelwoerister @jdm \n", "closed_by": {"login": "Manishearth", "id": 1617736, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc3MzY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1617736?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth", "html_url": "https://github.com/Manishearth", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21948/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21948/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
