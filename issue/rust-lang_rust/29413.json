If so, can we drop the DWARF symbols from the x86_64-pc-windows-msvc build?\n\nNote that in Cargo.toml we cannot (AFAICT) set a profile's debug setting on a per-platform basis.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "briansmith", "id": 16816, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODE2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16816?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/briansmith", "html_url": "https://github.com/briansmith", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/briansmith/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/briansmith/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/briansmith/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/briansmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/briansmith/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/briansmith/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/briansmith/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/briansmith/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/briansmith/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29413/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29413/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
