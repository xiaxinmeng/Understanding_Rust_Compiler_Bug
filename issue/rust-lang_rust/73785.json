I don't think removing a feature is the right call if people aren't noticing it, that's a UX concern. It's also not that much code.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan we reintroduce this UI as a little bubble on the return type? Putting it in the sidebar as a tiny circle was guaranteed to make it disappear. I found this feature quite useful, especially for iterators. In particular, my experience resonates with @Mark-Simulacrum's: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/69514#issuecomment-592159146 you need to click, scroll to the iterator impl, and then compare pages and substitute return types, whereas here it's all in one place.\r\n\r\nI think we have a good indication that we should experiment with the UI and find something that works.\r\n\r\nUltimately, even if a feature is useful for some and not most, we shouldn't be removing it unless it's a net negative impact on the \"most\", which is definitely not clear here.\r\n\r\n(I kinda wish that removing this feature had been FCPd)\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @GuillaumeGomez @kinnison @rust-lang/rustdoc ", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73785/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73785/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
