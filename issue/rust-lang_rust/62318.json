Re-compiling their whole project with `panic=unwind` for the purpose of running tests (this not only creates longer build times, but also changes the behavior of code between testing and production)\r\n2. Using a custom test harness (either ad-hoc which requries changes the source code for tests, or by using custom_test_harness which is unstable)\r\n\r\nNeither of these solutions are great. One solution that might be palatable is to support compiling `panic=abort` from libtest, but not support `#[should_panic]` tests in this mode. This could be advertised with an explicit error message anytime a test with `#[should_panic]` is run. Later, these could be supported as \"death tests\" as discussed in #32512.\r\n\r\nIn Fuchsia we'd really like to switch to `panic=abort`, and this is the main thing preventing us from doing so.\r\n\r\ncc @cramertj @petrhosek ", "closed_by": {"login": "tmandry", "id": 2280544, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIyODA1NDQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2280544?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry", "html_url": "https://github.com/tmandry", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62318/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62318/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
