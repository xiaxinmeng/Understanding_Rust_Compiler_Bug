On MIPS (specifically, on the [Tessel 2](https://github.com/tessel/tessel-rust), [technical overview](https://github.com/tessel/onboarding/blob/master/T2-TECHNICAL-OVERVIEW.md)) I'm getting different (incorrect) results from a function that does a bit of math, depending on:\n- if I'm accessing a struct variable from self\n- if I'm taking method arguments\n- if and where the println!'s are in the method\n- the size of the primitives I'm using to calculate each intermediate part (not an issue on my OS X desktop or the playground)\n\nHere's a [playground link](https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=1f06fc8f78a23f6103597d2465637546&version=stable&backtrace=0) with my ideal variation of the method; ideally, it should compute baud(9600) = **65326**. On MIPS, depending on the various factors I've listed above, I've seen varying results including 0 and 4294967295.  \n\nFrom what I can tell, this is falling apart with the floor() call (which appears to be an intrinsic - something I've seen others have difficulty with on MIPS). Take this snippet:\n\n``` rust\n        // wanted_f: f64 = 9600;\n        let part1: f64 = wanted_f / 48_000000f64;\n        let part2: f64 = 16f64 * part1;\n        let part3: f64 = 1f64 - part2;\n        let part4: f64 = 65536f64 * part3;\n        let part5: f64 = part4.floor();\n        let part6: u32 = part5 as u32;\n\n        println!(\"1: {}\", part1);\n        println!(\"2: {}\", part2);\n        println!(\"3: {}\", part3);\n        println!(\"4: {}\", part4);\n        println!(\"5: {}\", part5);\n        println!(\"6: {}\", part6);\n```\n\nGives the output:\n\n```\n1: 0.0002\n2: 0.0032\n3: 0.9968\n4: 65326.2848\n5: 0.0002\n6: 0\n```\n\n(where 5: should be 65326). If I add another intermediate local in between part4 and part5 (`let inter: f64 = part4.floor()`), both `inter` and `part5` have the **0.0002** value when printed.\n\nHowever, I can seemingly coerce it into working by putting a println! in the right place:\n\n``` rust\n        let wanted_f: f64 = self.baudrate as f64;\n        let baud: f64 = 65536f64 * (1f64 - (16f64 * (wanted_f / 48_000000f64)));\n        println!(\"inside fn: {}\", baud);\n        return baud.floor() as u32\n```\n\nThis returns the correct result, even on MIPS. \n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/35673/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/35673/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
