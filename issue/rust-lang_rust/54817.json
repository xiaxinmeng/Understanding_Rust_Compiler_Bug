Right now, this appears to work as intended. Incidentally, I think both rustc and std should make the necessary guarantees that this will always be safe, but I also think we should consider providing an API which deallocates these types without calling the destructors of their elements.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54817/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54817/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
