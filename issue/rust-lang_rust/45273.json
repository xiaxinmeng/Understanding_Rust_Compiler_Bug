I didn't do any further benchmarks yet, but the results seem promising. Looks like we could easily shave 5-10% from compilation time simply by changing the hash map implementation.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone else considered doing the same, and whether this is something I should experiment with further? What do you think?\r\n\r\ncc @bluss ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45273/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 6, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45273/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
