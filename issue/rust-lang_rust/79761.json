I am running on the **MacBook M1 with Big Sur OS**.

HOWEVER, the moment _**I added a new crate to my Cargo.toml**_, and ran cargo build then cargo test, I received the same message: (signal: 9, SIGKILL: kill). The moment I took off that crate, my tests are able to compile and run. It is almost as if everytime I **add** a new crate I have to reinstall rust to make my tests compile and run ?
