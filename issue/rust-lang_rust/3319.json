Generally, the only new language features added after this milestone must be backwards compatible, or to fix soundness holes, though we do expect to have some leeway to make small incompatible fixes that have low impact on existing code bases.\r\n\r\n* Library stability - We have a system of measuring and ensuring the stability of API's, and a significant portion of the standard library is declared stable. Stable API's will not change. Large portions of the standard library need to be stable for 1.0, including primitive types, vectors, strings, option, numerics, collections, some I/O and concurrency.\r\n\r\n* User experience - The system is polished and the presentation is complete and professional. New users have a clear path to using and learning the system. This encompasses the web site, documentation, installation, and tooling.\r\n", "creator": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 376, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2013-10-10T18:48:33Z", "updated_at": "2016-08-28T23:13:24Z", "due_on": "2015-05-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2015-05-21T20:59:13Z"}, "comments": 18, "created_at": "2012-08-31T19:21:56Z", "updated_at": "2014-01-06T11:16:39Z", "closed_at": "2014-01-06T11:16:39Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "When I open the Command Prompt, rustc is successfully found in PATH, but needs libgcc to run.\n\n```\nC:\\> rustc --lib mycode.rs\nThe program can't start because libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll is missing from your computer.\nTry reinstalling the program to fix this problem.\n```\n\nSo I try MinGW.\n\n```\n$ rustc --lib mycode.rs\nsh: rustc: command not found\n$ where rustc\nc:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rust\\bin\\rustc.exe\n$ rustc.exe\nUsage: c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rust\\bin\\rustc.exe [options] <input>\n...\n```\n\nFor some reason, MinGW cannot find `rustc` unless it is specified as `rustc.exe`.
