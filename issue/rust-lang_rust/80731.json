However, I don't think this restriction is technically necessary - it can be enforced at creation instead of in the type itself. [Here is an example](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=f977d6bd76f837b374ab77af6165389b) of code that doesn't compile because of this restriction (and [GATs are also affected by this](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=3761dfc0457a0dee9fc8564bd272533d)). That playground also contains a compiling version that works by erasing the types, which is especially silly because they do the exact same thing internally. I've run into this several times in the past and would love to see it fixed.", "closed_by": {"login": "Kestrer", "id": 38139193, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTM5MTkz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38139193?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kestrer", "html_url": "https://github.com/Kestrer", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kestrer/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kestrer/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kestrer/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kestrer/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kestrer/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kestrer/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kestrer/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kestrer/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Kestrer/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80731/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/80731/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
