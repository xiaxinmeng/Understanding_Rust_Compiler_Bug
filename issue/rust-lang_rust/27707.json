Some of the open questions currently are:\n- There are many many ways to walk a directory, and there probably wants to be something like a `WalkBuilder` structure.\n- The current walking strategy holds open a lot of file descriptors - #23715\n- The default walking strategy has not been well audited for all manner of fs corner cases\n\nThe [C++ `<filesystem>` implementation](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/fs/recursive_directory_iterator) of walking directories is quite a useful reference in terms of what options we may want as well as what we haven't implemented. Note that this is a large enough feature that this may want to be prototyped outside the standard library first and then perhaps consider moving in at a later date.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27707/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27707/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
