Make sure to include the relevant\r\nRFC for the feature if it has one. Otherwise provide a short summary of the\r\nfeature and link any relevant PRs or issues, and remove any sections that are\r\nnot relevant to the feature.\r\n\r\nRemember to add team labels to the tracking issue.\r\nFor a language team feature, this would e.g., be `T-lang`.\r\nSuch a feature should also be labeled with e.g., `F-my_feature`.\r\nThis label is used to associate issues (e.g., bugs and design questions) to the feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for using `#[doc(primitive)]`.\r\nThe feature gate for the issue is `#![feature(doc_primitive)]`.\r\n\r\nThis feature is not meant to ever become stable. It is an implementation detail of the standard library.\r\n\r\nDue to an oversight when releasing Rust 1.0, this could previously be used without a feature gate. That was a bug: this feature is not useful to anyone other than the standard library, and the behavior when multiple crates use `doc(primitive)` at once is unspecified (see \"Breaking changes to doc(primitive)\" in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87073). To avoid needlessly breaking crates, anyone using `doc(primitive)` without a feature gate will get a future-incompat warning instead of a hard error.\r\n\r\n`#[doc(primitive)]` still has an effect even without the feature gate, but the behavior is still unspecified when more than one crate has the same `primitive` attribute. Once https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87073 is merged and `core` starts documenting all primitives, it will be completely unspecified whether the new documentation is used or not.\r\n\r\n### About tracking issues\r\n\r\nTracking issues are used to record the overall progress of implementation.\r\nThey are also used as hubs connecting to other relevant issues, e.g., bugs or open design questions.\r\nA tracking issue is however *not* meant for large scale discussion, questions, or bug reports about a feature.\r\nInstead, open a dedicated issue for the specific matter and add the relevant feature gate label.\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n\r\n- [x] Initial implementation: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87050\r\n- [ ] Make this a hard error\r\n\r\n[stabilization-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr\r\n[doc-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#documentation-prs\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDoes this need an edition to become a hard error?
