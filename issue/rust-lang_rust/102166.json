For example, I passed rustc the flags `--crate-type proc-macro --emit link=rust/build/output/libforward.so,dep-info=rust/build/output/forward.d`, and the resulting dependency file contained `libforward.so: rust/proc-macro/forward/forward.rs` instead of `rust/build/output/libforward.so: rust/proc-macro-forward/forward.rs`.\r\n\r\nI observed this issue with both the rlib and proc-macro crate types on nightly 1.64.0.\r\n\r\nSimilar issue: #68839", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/102166/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/102166/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
