But now windows-rs is actually trying to insist it's an integer. Also there are other types like SOCKET that \"are\" HANDLEs for many purposes but are defined to be integers.\r\n\r\nI filed [an issue against windows-rs for this](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/issues/1643), detailing the many places that define typedefs for these types, which has some interesting discussion from Microsoft devs. I think the ultimate conclusion is that *truly* *truly* *truly* these are absolutely just integers and to the extent that the address of something might be embedded within, acting on that fact is being a smartass and basically just \"abi crimes\".\r\n\r\nIt's possible there is \"nothing to do here\" but at very least it's suboptimal for Rust and windows-sys to disagree on typedefs and if that's gonna happen we should at least Actively Decide To Do That instead of Accidentally Doing It.\r\n\r\nI left a mildly-confused-at-the-time FIXME about this here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3e7514670db841a7f0d7656f3b13b1c8b2c11599/library/std/src/os/windows/io/socket.rs#L132-L136\r\n\r\n(Arguably the \"real\" issue is that we define RawHandle to be `void*`)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/95490/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/95490/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
