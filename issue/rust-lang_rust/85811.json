Edition-specific preludes: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85684\r\n  2. Cargo `resolver = \"2\"` default: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9048\r\n  3. IntoIterator for array with backwards compatibility hack: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84513\r\n  4. Disjoint capture in closures: https://github.com/rust-lang/project-rfc-2229/milestone/5\r\n  5. Panic macro consistency: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80162\r\n  6. Reserved syntax: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84978\r\n  7. Promoting two warnings to hard errors: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83213\r\n  8. Or patterns in macro_rules: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54883\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n - [ ] When should we use a migration and when should we prefer to be strictly backwards compatible?\r\n    - This will roughly be decided on a per-feature basis\r\n - [ ] What is the policy on warnings and lints tied to the edition?\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85811/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 6, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85811/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
