Ordinarily, this is great, but in the case of `std::unreachable!`, it isn't particularly helpful.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#![deny(unreachable_code)]\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    return;\r\n    \r\n    unreachable!();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n([Playground link](https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=5fd1d9f2b23cc75b8419120513406274&version=stable))\r\n\r\nThis results in:\r\n```\r\nerror: unreachable statement\r\n --> src/main.rs:6:5\r\n  |\r\n6 |     unreachable!();\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  |\r\nnote: lint level defined here\r\n --> src/main.rs:1:9\r\n  |\r\n1 | #![deny(unreachable_code)]\r\n  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  = note: this error originates in a macro outside of the current crate\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case the warning isn't particularly helpful given that I've explicitly marked the code as unreachable. It seems like it would be reasonable to avoid emitting a warning in this case.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this is problematic because `#![deny(unreachable_code)]` is implied by `#![deny(warnings)]`. I'm working in a large codebase that makes heavy use of `#![deny(warnings)]`. As a result, I'm not able to use `std::unreachable!()` without explicitly allowing unreachable code, which isn't desirable. \r\n\r\nOftentimes I'd like to use `std::unreachable!()` in places where unreachability is statically provable, but not intuitively obvious to a human reading the code. For now I've settled on just using comments instead.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46500/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46500/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
