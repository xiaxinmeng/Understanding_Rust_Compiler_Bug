Here\u2019s part of the impact that may not have been considered:\n\nThe Debian package build system includes a tool `dpkg-shlibdeps` that scans all binaries and libraries to be included in a package to infer dependency information for shared libraries. Based on the symbol information in `/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.symbols`, the use of `__pthread_get_minstack@GLIBC_PRIVATE` is translated into a strict versioned dependency on the exact version of libc6 that the package was built against:\n\n```\n$ cat thread-test.rs\nuse std::thread;\nfn main() {\n    thread::scoped(move || {println!(\"Hello, world!\")}).join();\n}\n$ rustc thread-test.rs\n$ mkdir debian; touch debian/control\n$ dpkg-shlibdeps -v -v thread-test\n\u2026\n Looking up symbol madvise@GLIBC_2.2.5\n Found in symbols file of libc.so.6 (minver: 2.2.5, dep: libc6 #MINVER#)\n Looking up symbol pthread_mutex_unlock@GLIBC_2.2.5\n Found in symbols file of libpthread.so.0 (minver: 2.2.5, dep: libc6 #MINVER#)\n Looking up symbol __pthread_get_minstack@GLIBC_PRIVATE\n Found in symbols file of libpthread.so.0 (minver: 0, dep: libc6 (>> 2.19), libc6 (<< 2.20))\n Looking up symbol _Unwind_FindEnclosingFunction@GCC_3.3\n Found in symbols file of libgcc_s.so.1 (minver: 1:4.1.1, dep: libgcc1 #MINVER#)\n Looking up symbol strncmp@GLIBC_2.2.5\n Found in symbols file of libc.so.6 (minver: 2.2.5, dep: libc6 #MINVER#)\n\u2026\n$ cat debian/substvars\nshlibs:Depends=libc6 (>= 2.18), libc6 (>> 2.19), libc6 (<< 2.20), libgcc1 (>= 1:4.1.1)\n```\n\nWhat this means in practice is that a Debian package containing threaded Rust code built on one release of Debian or Ubuntu will not be installable on any other release. Trying to upgrade to a new release while such a package is installed will cause dependency errors.\n\n(What caused me to notice this problem is that the `rust-nightly` package for Ubuntu 14.10 in [ppa:hansjorg/rust](https://launchpad.net/~hansjorg/+archive/ubuntu/rust/+packages) is no longer installable on Ubuntu 15.04 after a libc6 upgrade.)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/23628/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/23628/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
