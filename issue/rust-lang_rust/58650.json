Of course you can achieve the same behavior by using `<=` or `!(x > y)` but I usually think more in terms of **not greater** instead of **less than or equal**. The `!(x > y)` syntax requires more keystrokes and reads: **not: x is greater than y** which is very unlike natural speech and requires the programmer to bend according to the language, while the language should be as ergonomic as possible.\r\n\r\nI am curious why these operators are not widespread, if there is a reason for that, because I can't see how they would make code harder to reason about or how they would be inconsistent or anything (there is the `!=` operator already, and I suppose we are all glad that we don't have to read or write `!(x == y)` every time).\r\n\r\nI am curious what your opinions about this feature proposal are.", "closed_by": {"login": "varkor", "id": 3943692, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM2OTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3943692?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor", "html_url": "https://github.com/varkor", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/varkor/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58650/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58650/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
