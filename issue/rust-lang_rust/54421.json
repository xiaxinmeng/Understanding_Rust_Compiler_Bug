For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n          assert_eq!((0..5).partial_cmp(10..20), Some(Ordering::Less));           \r\n          assert_eq!((5..6).partial_cmp(1..5), Some(Ordering::Greater));          \r\n          assert_eq!((5..10).partial_cmp(8..9), None);                            \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last assertion here fails:\r\n```\r\n  left: `Some(Less)`,\r\n right: `None`', src/lib.rs:81:9\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis surprised me, as (unless I am mistaken) overlapping ranges cannot be compared in the interval order. In the above example, both 8 and 9 are members of both ranges.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_order):\r\n\r\n> one interval, I1, being considered less than another, I2, if I1 is completely to the left of I2\r\n\r\nI suspect that the partial order of ranges has been `derive`ed leading to pairwise comparisons of the upper and lower bounds, which is a different partial ordering (actually a total ordering I think).\r\n\r\nAm I right? If so, should `Range` implement interval order? In either case, improved documentation would really help.\r\n\r\nThanks", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54421/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54421/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
