Generally, the only new language features added after this milestone must be backwards compatible, or to fix soundness holes, though we do expect to have some leeway to make small incompatible fixes that have low impact on existing code bases.\r\n\r\n* Library stability - We have a system of measuring and ensuring the stability of API's, and a significant portion of the standard library is declared stable. Stable API's will not change. Large portions of the standard library need to be stable for 1.0, including primitive types, vectors, strings, option, numerics, collections, some I/O and concurrency.\r\n\r\n* User experience - The system is polished and the presentation is complete and professional. New users have a clear path to using and learning the system. This encompasses the web site, documentation, installation, and tooling.\r\n", "creator": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 376, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2013-10-10T18:48:33Z", "updated_at": "2016-08-28T23:13:24Z", "due_on": "2015-05-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2015-05-21T20:59:13Z"}, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2014-09-10T06:53:38Z", "updated_at": "2014-09-13T10:26:07Z", "closed_at": "2014-09-13T10:26:07Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "``` rust\nfn call_rec(n: uint, f: |uint| -> uint) -> uint {\n    if n == 0 { return 1 }\n\n    f(call_rec(n - 1, f))                       // A\n    // let tmp = call_rec(n - 1, f); f(tmp)        // B\n    // (|x| f(x))(call_rec(n - 1, f))              // C\n    // let tmp = call_rec(n - 1, |x| f(x)); f(tmp) // D\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut y = 0u;\n    let f = |x| { y += x; y };\n\n    println!(\"{}\", call_rec(5, f));\n}\n```\n### A\n\n(\"Obvious\" code.)\n\n```\n<anon>:4:23: 4:24 error: cannot move out of `f` because it is borrowed\n<anon>:4     f(call_rec(n - 1, f)) // A\n                               ^\n<anon>:4:5: 4:6 note: borrow of `f` occurs here\n<anon>:4     f(call_rec(n - 1, f)) // A\n             ^\n```\n### B\n\n(Use a temporary.)\n\n```\n<anon>:5:35: 5:36 error: use of moved value: `f`\n<anon>:5     let tmp = call_rec(n - 1, f); f(tmp) // B\n                                           ^\n<anon>:5:31: 5:32 note: `f` moved here because it has type `|uint| -> uint`, which is a non-copyable stack closure (capture it in a new closure, e.g. `|x| f(x)`, to override)\n<anon>:5     let tmp = call_rec(n - 1, f); f(tmp) // B\n                                       ^\n```\n### C\n\n(Reborrow `f` for the outer call.)\n\n**Incorrectly compiles & runs.**\n### D\n\n(Reborrow `f` for the inner call.)\n\nCorrectly compiles & runs.\n\n---\n\nIt seems that `A`, `B` and `C` should all be essentially equivalent, and thus should all not compile, because `f` is moved into the recursive call before the outer call (and hence that outer call should be disallowed), and thus the reborrowing in `C` should be illegal (it is reborrowing the moved-from  `f`).\n\nThis may just disappear once these closures are removed.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/17144/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/17144/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
