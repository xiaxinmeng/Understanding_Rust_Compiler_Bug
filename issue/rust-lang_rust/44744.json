Then i installed the Rust (rls) plugin and the LLDB Debugger one. The Rust plugin asked me if i wanted to install nightly builds and as i recall that it needs that at this time, i said yes and it did it's thing. \r\n\r\nI can successfully build and run a rust program from inside VS Code. I just noticed (as you can see in the attached picture) that any warning is reported twice.\r\n![rustissue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21091147/30702792-97339b0c-9ef6-11e7-8c8e-60fba4c8ee5f.jpeg)\r\n\r\nAnd if i do a \"dustup update\" in a terminal, i see one entry for\r\n\"stable-x86_64-apple-darwin unchanged - rustc 1.20.0 (f3d6973f4 2017-08-27)\"\r\n\r\nand another one with:\r\n\" nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin unchanged - rustc 1.22.0-nightly (01c65cb15 2017-09-20)\"\r\n\r\nDoes this mean i end up with 2 versions of the compiler and thus the duplicated warning or not?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for any help in a newbie in Rust!\r\n\r\nAnthony", "closed_by": {"login": "workingjubilee", "id": 46493976, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDkzOTc2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46493976?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee", "html_url": "https://github.com/workingjubilee", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44744/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44744/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
