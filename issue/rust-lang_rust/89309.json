It's not exactly systemic, but it's something like (level + 3) % 6, where what should be heading levels 4-6 (examples, etc) become heading level 1 and 2. This is confusing, but once you learn things like impl blocks tend to be heading level 3 and functions are usually level 4, you effectively have a \"jump to next function\" keystroke and so on.\r\n\r\nHere's what's happening: in Markdown `#` generally represents an `h1`, `##` represents `h2`, and so on. That means each docblock often has `h1`s and `h2`s in them, even though they are nested under higher-up `h1`s and `h2`s. For instance, https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.55.0/std/io/trait.Read.html has an `<h1>Trait std::io::Read</h1>` and an `<h1>Examples</h1>`. The latter should be `<h2>`. Similarly, there's an `<h4>fn read...</h4>`, with an `<h1>Errors</h1>` nested under it. The latter should be `<h5>`.\r\n\r\nPer https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements#usage_notes:\r\n\r\n> Avoid skipping heading levels: always start from `<h1>`, followed by `<h2>` and so on.\r\n> Use only one `<h1>` per page or view. It should concisely describe the overall purpose of the content.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we already control the `<h{level}>` tag that's emitted based on Markdown. The code is here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/2b6ed3b675475abc01ce7e68bb75b457f0c85684/src/librustdoc/html/markdown.rs#L535-L540. What we additionally need:\r\n\r\n - Add a way to keep track of what heading level we're generating Markdown into: are we nested under an `<h1>` or under an `<h4>`?\r\n - Adjust the `{level}` interpolation to add the number of levels appropriate. This should be capped at 6, since h6 is the highest defined in HTML.\r\n - Adjust CSS styles appropriately.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/89309/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/89309/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
