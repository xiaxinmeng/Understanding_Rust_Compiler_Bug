Using them separately works fine, but using them together leads to the situation that a dependency of these dependencies is configured to use `std`. Furthermore, the issue can only be reproduced if this takes place in a workspace. A minimal working example is at <https://github.com/humenda/mwe-cargo-nostd\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. `rustup component add aarch64-unknown-none`\r\n2. Clone the mentioned repository and cd to it.\r\n3. `cargo build --target aarch64-unknown-none`, output is:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    error[E0463]: can't find crate for `std`\r\n  |\r\n  = note: the `aarch64-unknown-none` target may not support the standard library\r\n  = note: `std` is required by `memchr` because it does not declare `#![no_std]`\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Uncommenting heapless or the nom stanza in `ex/Cargo.toml` makes it compile.\r\n5.`cp -dpr ex /tmp && cd /tmp/ex && cargo build --target aarch64-unknown-none` succeeds.\r\n\r\nAt this point I am stuck and would appreciate feedback. Is it a misconfiguration or a bug?", "closed_by": {"login": "ehuss", "id": 43198, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTk4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43198?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss", "html_url": "https://github.com/ehuss", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/92387/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/92387/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
