As far as the public API is concerned everything is `Foo<'a>`. Upon insertion into the hash map the key object is cloned and becomes `Foo<'static>` so that is fine.\r\n\r\nAll the read only interfaces to the `HashMap` also work out because I believe a `&HashMap<Foo<'static>, V>` becomes a `&HashMap<Foo<'a>, V>` automatically.\r\n\r\nThe issue comes up with `HashMap::remove` which is mutable. There this coercion does not happen because obviously the intention is to stop people from putting a `Foo<'a>` into the hashmap. Because I do not want to do the expensive clone of the key value to make it static upon removal I currently have to unsafe coerce the `&Foo<'a>` into a `&Foo<'static>` for removal which is not great.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a bug and if it is, where it is. But I figured I raise it anyways.\r\n\r\n(Also I'm not sure about any of the terms to refer to these concepts)", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40881/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40881/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
