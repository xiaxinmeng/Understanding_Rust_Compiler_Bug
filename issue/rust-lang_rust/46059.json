Consequently, when we load something with a `Span` from disk (like a piece of MIR, for example), and that `Span` in there had a non-zero `ctxt` before being stored to disk, then we get a different `Fingerprint` because we now have an empty `ctxt`. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether this is harmless and could be ignored but it certainly messes with the otherwise very handy `-Zincremental-verify-ich` feature. I'd prefer if we found a way of making this completely accurate (e.g. by somehow serializing and then restoring `Span` expansion contexts).\r\n\r\ncc @nikomatsakis ", "closed_by": {"login": "michaelwoerister", "id": 1825894, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjU4OTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1825894?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister", "html_url": "https://github.com/michaelwoerister", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46059/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46059/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
