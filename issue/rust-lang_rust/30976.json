In fact, I suspect the most intuitive thing would be to start from the root obligation and print _that_, and then show the chain of reasoning which ultimately failed. For example, if we had `Vec<Box<Foo>>: Debug` and it turns out that `Foo: ?Debug`, then we would print something like:\n- `Vec<Box<Foo>>: Debug` does not hold\n  - impl from stdlib for `Vec` does not apply because `Box<Foo>: Debug` does not hold:\n  - impl from stdlib for `Box` does not apply because `Foo: Debug` does not hold:\n  - no impl of `Debug` for `Foo` found\n\nAs part of this, we will want to (I think) change how we assign \"causes\" to the subobligations. Currently, we propagate the cause of the root obligation. I think what we want to do instead is to assign a cause that indicates the impl whence the subobligation was created. That way, when printing the backtrace, we can walk through the impls and show them to the user.\n\nPS, I know there is a duplicate of various existing bug reports. I didn't really look, but we should try to gather up all the various examples into one master bug. Perhaps this one?\n\ncc @aturon @arielb1 \n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30976/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30976/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
