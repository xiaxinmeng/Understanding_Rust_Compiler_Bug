For example, the ability to take a bytestream and construct a Windows path out of it in order to detect whether it is a valid Windows path would be great.\r\n\r\nThe use case is implementing a check for Git repositories which validates that a path is valid on Windows. The `OsStrExt` to get access to the underlying data as if it were a Windows path would be useful for this (since the check should be able to do its work on any platform).\r\n\r\nI suspect that there are other APIs that would be useful for manipulating data as another platform might see it.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60845/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60845/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
