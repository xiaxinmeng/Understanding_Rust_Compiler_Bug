Often they are confused because they \"built from source today!\" and we have to explain that they should use incoming, since it's actually quite stable anyway.\n\nOf course, the other option is to removing incoming altogether, but the advantage of master being some sort of \"super-stable\", but not release, branch is nice.\n\nAnyway, setting `HEAD` to `incoming` would mean that people that just grab the repository directly are already sitting on the branch that we almost always suggest switching to. This should hopefully make rust a little more newbie-friendly.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Aatch", "id": 342416, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjQxNg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342416?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch", "html_url": "https://github.com/Aatch", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7037/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7037/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
