It's also kind of difficult to describe, as I'm not completely sure what the *root* cause is.\r\n\r\nIn my code I have a macro by example with two separate repetitions, one `$(...)*` and one `$(...)?` and trying to expand one inside the other fails to compile.\r\n\r\nI have tried to come up with a minimal example:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nmacro_rules! bug {\r\n    (\r\n        $($names1:ident)+ : $($names2:ident)+\r\n    ) => {\r\n        concat!(\r\n            // rustc gets confused about us using one repetition inside the other...\r\n            $(\r\n                stringify!($($names1),+, $names2)\r\n            ),+\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Use the macro in some way so the compiler doesn't toss it out...\r\npub const TEST: &'static str = bug!(this doesnt work : mbe go boom);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my case, where I'm using a `$(...)?` repetition, I could work around it by having multiple rules instead, one for the 0 case, one for the 1 case. However, as far as I can tell, there's no way to work around when using multiple $(...)+ or $(...)* repetitions.\r\n\r\nI'm on the latest stable rustc (1.45.0).\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74524/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74524/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
