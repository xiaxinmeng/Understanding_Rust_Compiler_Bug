The generated output is about ~800K so it's not adversely affecting the download size. Most of the documentation just tells to go another website.\r\n\r\n### Possible Solutions\r\n- Remove the files. This will technically break links that reference this documentation, though I don't know if these a lot of these docs have been actively referenced since 2015\u20132016.\r\n- Change the implementation to generate redirects, rather than regular pages.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/70840/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/70840/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
