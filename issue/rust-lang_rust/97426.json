I was discussing with @dingxiangfei2009 and I am of the opinion that we can *probably* remove the `region_scope_tree` entirely now that we have moved over to the MIR borrow checker (i.e., NLL). We looked over the places that the `region_scope_tree` is used and it seems to be primarily dealing with \"when do we run destructors\". I think that we could probably just store the hir-id of statements and blocks and it's not important to model the full detail of the region-scope-tree. We didn't look closely into it though and it will require some detailed examination, so for now we are filing an issue to follow up on later.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97426/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97426/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
