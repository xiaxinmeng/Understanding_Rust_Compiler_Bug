Also to address the various challenges of destructors and finalizers that have been [uncovered in other languages](http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2002/HPL-2002-335.html).\n\nMy current preference is to say that destructors can only be created for sendable types.  Or, put another way, destructors should only be able to access owned content.  Perhaps this is too extreme, but it's a nice simple rule.  \n\nAnyway, I wanted to open a blanket bug for those other bugs, and perhaps to spark some discussion and thought.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4301/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4301/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
