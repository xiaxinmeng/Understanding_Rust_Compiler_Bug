This meant that bors picked up #7289 (the original and closed PR). Closing #7292 and reopening #7289 removed #7289 from the status page and added #7292, so @thestinger closed both, and moved the commit to #7274. Bors then merrily merged #7289 (it was closed) before the previous patch (#7210) had finished running, and _then_ remerged #7210 so there were 3 separate auto builds happening concurrently (two of the same pull request).\n\n![bors-madness](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1203825/690580/d8a4dd6a-db0c-11e2-9571-c1565057a6cf.png)\n\n(It seems there are several bors processes running, e.g. the multiple sets of comments on #7274.)\n\nIt got worse... 3 lots of the one pull request (#7274):\n\n![bors-madness-2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1203825/690585/ecd4886a-db0e-11e2-8397-6b5621c345fb.png)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "graydon", "id": 14097, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDk3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14097?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon", "html_url": "https://github.com/graydon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7293/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7293/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
