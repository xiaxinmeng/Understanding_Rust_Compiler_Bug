I see the following reasons why:\r\n\r\n- Compiler flags are already mentioned [in the rustc book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/command-line-arguments.html) to keep documentation close together I believe it would make sense to keep all compiler flags close together. In order to avoid documentation duplication (which is hard to maintain), I believe placing them in the rustc book is more logical then not mentioning them in the rustc book and only having them in the unstable book.\r\n\r\n- It seems that the unstable compiler flags in the unstable book are not maintained, unless there are only two unstable compiler flags (which I believe is not true since -Z lists many options).\r\n\r\nI'd like to hear your opinion on this and, if you agree, under which section we should place this documentation. We could also aim to automize the generation of these nightly compiler flags?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/59679/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/59679/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
