But I think in general it is nice to ignore the same whitespace that every other programming language and file format ignores; it lessens confusion for people coming from other languages and backgrounds.\n\nMy specific use case is the long-standing, but somewhat uncommon use of the form-feed character (which semantically is a separator between pages of text) as a way to group together especially closely related functions or blocks in a file of source code. Text editors or IDEs such as vim, Emacs or XCode provide convenience features to display these form-feeds in aesthetically pleasing way, move between form-feed-delimited pages, and restrict editing to one form-feed-delimited page at a time. It's just a simple convenience feature, but it would really be nice to support it.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29590/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29590/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
