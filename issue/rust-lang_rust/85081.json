This makes it possible to still add the `CodeRegions` for the removed (unreachable) code to the coverage map, so they can be reported as unexecuted code.\r\n\r\nThe MIR `InstrumentCoverage` pass always adds a `CoverageKind::Counter` to the `START_BLOCK` (so if a function is called, it is counted), and I assumed that the `START_BLOCK` itself could never be simplified away.\r\n\r\nHowever, when compiling some complex async and executor constructions from a large code base, the compiler ICE'd, and I was able to determine that some kind of MIR transform can drop the `START_BLOCK`, and can generate a final MIR that has all `CoverageKind::Counter` statements replaced with `CoverageKind::Unreachable` statements. \r\n\r\nThe ICE is caused now when a function has `CoverageKind::Unreachable` statements and no `CoverageKind::Counter`. At least one `CoverageKind::Counter` is required, to set the function hash for LLVM InstrProf, and an `assert!()` fails when generating the coverage map (for the unreachable regions) without this function hash.\r\n\r\nA PR that fixes this issue has been uploaded (#85082).\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "richkadel", "id": 3827298, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjcyOTg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3827298?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/richkadel", "html_url": "https://github.com/richkadel", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richkadel/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richkadel/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richkadel/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richkadel/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richkadel/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richkadel/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richkadel/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richkadel/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/richkadel/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85081/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85081/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
