Typically this is a PR\r\nimplementing a feature, followed by a PR that stabilises the feature. However\r\nfor larger features an implementation could be broken up into multiple PRs.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Remove unstable features that currently use const traits: #110393 \r\n- [ ] Remove logic in the compiler around const traits to allow a better implementation\r\n- [ ] Land a better implementation in the compiler (see previous attempt at #101900)\r\n- [ ] Restore unstable features using const traits", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110395/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 2, "-1": 3, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110395/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
