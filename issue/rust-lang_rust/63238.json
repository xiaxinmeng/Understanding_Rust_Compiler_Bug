Permissively licensed code here effectively means \"MIT or weaker\", though as structured currently it actually makes anything without an MIT license an exception (BSD licenses are considered exceptions). This is fine and simplifies std's license (it's all MIT and most can be Apache, with the unfortunate exception of libbacktrace, which is BSD-3-Clause, and not represented in the exception list, potentially because of https://github.com/rust-lang/backtrace-rs/issues/234).\r\n\r\nThey should all be re-triaged, and re-commented or removed from the exception list as appropriate. Here are some examples from a quick look:\r\n\r\n- thread-id - now Apache-2.0/MIT, was Apache-2.0, no longer an exception\r\n- ryu - now Apache-2.0/BSL-1.0 (nice decision @dtolnay w/ the permissive license + runtime exception). Still an exception per the rules in this file because it doesn't carry MIT. Aside: Apache-2.0/MIT/BSL-1.0 would be a good relicense for Rust. I'd prefer ryu be tri-licensed with MIT just for uniformity with the rest of the Rust MIT-licensed ecosystem.\r\n- utf8parse - Apache-2.0/MIT, not an exception\r\n- vte - Apache-2.0/MIT, not an exception\r\n\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63238/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63238/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
