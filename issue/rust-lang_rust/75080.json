Make sure to include the relevant\r\nRFC for the feature if it has one. Otherwise provide a short summary of the\r\nfeature and link any relevant PRs or issues, and remove any sections that are\r\nnot relevant to the feature.\r\n\r\nRemember to add team labels to the tracking issue.\r\nFor a language team feature, this would e.g., be `T-lang`.\r\nSuch a feature should also be labeled with e.g., `F-my_feature`.\r\nThis label is used to associate issues (e.g., bugs and design questions) to the feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for switching libstd to intra-doc links (rust-lang/rfcs#1946, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74430#issuecomment-664693080).\r\n\r\n### About tracking issues\r\n\r\nTracking issues are used to record the overall progress of implementation.\r\nThey are also uses as hubs connecting to other relevant issues, e.g., bugs or open design questions.\r\nA tracking issue is however *not* meant for large scale discussion, questions, or bug reports about a feature.\r\nInstead, open a dedicated issue for the specific matter and add the relevant feature gate label.\r\n\r\n### Mentoring instructions (or rather, suggested workflow)\r\n\r\nPlease first leave a comment here stating that you want to work on file xxx.rs or module xxx, to make sure that this implements `Sync`.\r\n\r\n1. For each link of the form\r\n```rust\r\n[`Type`]: ../../std/module/kind.Name.html#method.foo\r\n```\r\nrewrite it as\r\n```\r\n[`Type`]: std::module::Name::foo\r\n```\r\nIn most cases, the type will already be in scope, in which case you can remove the reference link altogether.\r\nFor an example PR, see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74470.\r\n\r\n2. Run `x.py doc library/std`. This should `warn(broken_intra_doc_links)` by default.\r\n3. Fix any warnings that appear.\r\n4. Once you are ready to make a PR, run `./x.py tidy`, which will run `rustfmt`.\r\n\r\nIn case of rustdoc bugs, there may be broken links that didn't show up when you ran `x.py doc`. However, these will be caught by the test suite, so you don't have to check them locally.\r\n\r\n### Suggested tools\r\n\r\n- @poliorcetics wrote a python script which can automate much of the conversion: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75080#issuecomment-670935099\r\n- @denisvasilik wrote a regex which matches links in `core` and `std`: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75080#issuecomment-668985777\r\n- @rdambrosio016 came up with several different regexes, starting around https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75080#issuecomment-668374288\r\n\r\n### Caveats\r\n\r\n~~Primitives that have the same name as a module in scope must use `type@` to disambiguate them. For example, to link to `char` from std, use `type@char`.~~ This was changed in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75318, `char` will now link to the primitive, not the module.\r\n\r\nThe following cannot use intra-doc links. If you run into an issue with them, it's ok to skip them. However, if you see an issue not mentioned here, please file a bug report!\r\n\r\n- Some primitives (notably slices and pointers): https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63351, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74515\r\n- Links from `core` to `std` (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/74481)\r\n- Documentation is also tested with `--stage 0`, so you may not be able to make changes that require recently merged fixes: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75368#issuecomment-672196852\r\n- ~~Associated items anywhere other than documenting the associated item itself (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74489)~~ Fixed\r\n- ~~Links on default function implementations for a trait (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73829). Note that these will not warn if they fail to resolve, so you should be careful about modifying links on traits.~~ Fixed\r\n\r\n## TODO list\r\n\r\nThis list was generated with `rg '\\[.*\\]: \\.\\./.*' library/ -l | sed 's/^/- [ ] /'` and may not be complete. If you see other links not mentioned here, feel free to fix them as well.\r\n\r\nSince most files only have a few links, it's fine to claim multiple files at the same time.\r\n\r\n### Unclaimed\r\n\r\n- [ ] `[std::convert::identity]: crate::convert::identity` (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75423#issuecomment-672641760)\r\n- [ ] `[i32::MAX]` (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76093)\r\n- [ ] `[crate::ptr]` in libcore (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76106)\r\n- [ ] `[TcpStream::read]: Read::read` (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75674)\r\n\r\n### In-progress\r\n\r\n- [ ] library/core/src/num/mod.rs (Claimed by @jyn514 in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75080#issuecomment-678635203)\r\n- [ ] `[flush]: Write::flush` (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75674/files#diff-1eb455549b75a568d81f2f6a8a7020c0R446, claimed by @pitaj in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75080#issuecomment-709773862)\r\n- [ ] floating point methods in intrinsics (see description of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75705, claimed by @pitaj in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75080#issuecomment-709773862)\r\n\r\n### Completed\r\n\r\n- [x] library/core/src/str/mod.rs (Claimed by @poliorcetics in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75080#issuecomment-707376173)\r\n- [x] library/core/src/time.rs ([claimed by @denisvasilik](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75080#issuecomment-667821547))\r\n- [x] library/core/src/cmp.rs ([claimed by @denisvasilik](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75080#issuecomment-667821547))\r\n- [x] library/core/src/borrow.rs ([claimed by @denisvasilik](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75080#issuecomment-667821547))\r\n- [x] library/std/src/path.rs (Claimed by @poliorcetics in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75080#issuecomment-670714996)\r\n- [x] library/std/src/os/*/fs.rs (Claimed by @nixphix in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/75080#issuecomment-671775178).
