However, this code needs proper inclusive range support in order to work; I can't add 1 to the maximum value of a type in order to make it include every possible value for that type. That is available [here](https://gist.github.com/aarzee/4395cb34eef31ea4e5c4).\n\nI'm interested in implementing this logic in the compiler but I've no idea where to start, plus the code has the aforementioned inclusive range requirement.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "arielb1", "id": 1830974, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzA5NzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1830974?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1", "html_url": "https://github.com/arielb1", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28477/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28477/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
