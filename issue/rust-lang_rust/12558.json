All of them produced an error of the form \"'couldn't run the test: permission denied', [snip]/rust/src/librustdoc/test.rs:131\".\n\nInvestigating this further, it turns out to be because rustdoc's `test.rs` attempts to create a file in a temporary directory and then execute it. By default on my platform, this happens in `/tmp`. My `/tmp`, however, is mounted with the \"noexec\" option that prevents executing files from it.\n\nArguably this is just user error on my part for configuring things this way, but I don't think it's an uncommon setup. It was also quite a mysterious way for things to fail. Perhaps the test runner could check for this and fail more usefully?\n\nIn the meantime, a workaround is to run the tests with the environment variable `TMPDIR` set to something else.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12558/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12558/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
