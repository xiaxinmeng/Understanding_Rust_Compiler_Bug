I'll update the list according to their response.\n\nNon trivial contributors:\n- @TeXitoi: OK\n\nContributors appearing in git blame that are trivial (trivial update due to language changes)\n- @alexcrichton (lifetime syntax, privacy fix): MoCo employee\n- @erickt (`'self` lifetime illegal): OK\n- @edwardw (move `swap`): OK\n- @pcwalton (`~[T]` removing): MoCo employee\n- @richo (rename `StrBuff` to `String` (only apear in a comment, the comment should be updated as String is not used): waiting for response\n- @bjz  (remove `println` from prelude): OK\n\nContributors with removed contributions (acceptation of the license change is not necessary IMHO):\n- @kballard (`from_utf8_owned` remove): optional\n- @thestinger (rename std::vec -> std::slice): optional\n- @mankyKitty (`rev()` modifications): OK\n- @SimonSapin (rename `from_utf8_owned_opt()`): OK\n- @huonw (`vec_ng` remove): optional\n- @Kimundi (iterator refactor): optional\n\nFinally, I'd like that @brson or any core developer validates the process, and say if trivial changes should be taken into account for that.\n\nWhen the license change will be accepted, I'll send a PR.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/14420/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/14420/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
