So if the actual text were `Option<T` and you wrote `Option<T>`, it would fail the test. But if the actual were `Option<T>` and the expected were `Option<T`, it would pass the test.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is not super intuitive and seems like it could lead to false negatives where it didn't catch regressions. Rustdoc should consider changing it.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @jyn514 in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/76934#discussion_r491520801_", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76942/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76942/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
