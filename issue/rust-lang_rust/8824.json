Functions and method calls are enclosed by mandatory parantheses, and these obscure the logic of the code when nested.\n\nMethods are already placed neatly (like operators) bewteen two objects (`a .eq (b)`)  but with an infix call we can make this easier to read.\n\n```\na.and(b.and(c.and(d)))\n```\n\ncan be\n\n```\na `and` b `and` c `and` d\n```\n\nand instead of overloading `+` for lists we can have\n\n```\n~[1,2,3] `concat` ~[2,3,4]\n```\n\nor a parser can use\n\n```\nAlNum `and` (AlNum `or` Hyphen)\n```\n\nInfix binary functions are simpler and have less drawbacks compared to arbitrary user operators. They are also more flexible than the builtin set of operators (that are limited in number and force call by `&T`).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8824/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8824/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
