Since they both use the `&` operator, I incorrectly imposed my C++ expectations onto how the references work in Rust. I think a good place for this would be in the [references and borrowing section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/references-and-borrowing.html).\n\nAn example to illustrate.\n\nC++:\n\n``` cpp\nvoid swap(int &a, int &b) {\n    int temp = a;\n    a = b;\n    b = temp;\n    return;\n}\n```\n\nRust:\n\n``` rust\nfn swap(x: &mut i32, y: &mut i32) {\n    let temp = *x;\n    *x = *y;\n    *y = temp;\n}\n```\n\nI was initially confused by the need for the `*` operator in Rust to dereference a reference since C++ does this implicitly.  This was compounded by the fact that when you call methods on objects with `.`, a `*` isn't required, so I had seen many reference examples without `*`.  In the beginner's chat room a very friendly community member explained to me that `.` automatically dereferences when needed (which I was grateful for!).\n\nI'm happy to submit a PR, but I'm not sure exactly the best way to word this (if this is even something others think would be helpful).  If I totally missed this in the docs already I'm happy to be pointed to it. :)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37413/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37413/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
