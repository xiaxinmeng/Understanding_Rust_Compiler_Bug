This test checks that closed file descriptors raise an acceptable error, and this does not happen anymore. Here is the fallback code for `rhg`, running the Python version of `hg` as a subprocess.\r\n\r\nHere is the (somewhat convoluted) reproduction, which requires `python` be a valid Python 3 interpreter that I used with `cargo bisect-rust` (thanks @SimonSapin for the pointer on that tool btw):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n//! Run the executable (not with `cargo play`, it'll eat the redirect)\r\n//!     `myexecutable -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.write(\"hello\")' 1>&-`\r\n//! If compiled with 1.41.1, it will output (with an error code of 1):\r\n//!\r\n//! Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n//!  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n//!  AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'write'\r\n//!\r\n//! But with 1.48.0, it doesn't output anything and silently eats the error code,\r\n//! exiting with 0.\r\n\r\nuse std::process::Command;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let mut args_os = std::env::args_os();\r\n    args_os.next().expect(\"expected argv[0] to exist\");\r\n    let mut c = Command::new(\"python\");\r\n    c.args(args_os);\r\n    let status = c.status();\r\n    match status {\r\n        Err(_) => (),\r\n        Ok(s) =>  {\r\n            if s.success() {\r\n                std::process::exit(1);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure what to think of it yet, but my gut feeling is that eating errors is bad; I'm reporting this now since it's fresh in my mind.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88825/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88825/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
