These words could be broader concepts (especially equivalent ideas in other languages) that would help the user find something when he's not already familiar with the rust layout and naming schemes. They could also be names of equivalent features in other languages. Search could be refined by entering both tags to find and supress. ('yes i'm looking for more of this.. no i'm looking for less of that').\r\n\r\nThe core libraries deal with concepts that are very well understood so people find their way around pretty quickly, but what about when dealing with the unknown .. experimental variations, new fields, trying to standardise ideas which aren't well established. Naming is hard, but including synonyms (and antonyms) might help.\r\n\r\nExamples:-\r\n\r\n**enum Option**    tags:  _\"Maybe\"; \"Optional\"; \"null pointers\"; \"nullable\"; \"error handling\"_\r\n**struct HashMap**    tags: _\"map\" \"dictionary\" \"associative array\" \"hash table\" \"key value\"_\r\n**struct Vec**          tags: _\"vector\" \"dynamic array\" \"sequence\" \"random access\"_\r\n\r\nthey could be specified by some syntax in the doc-comments (wrap them in double square brackets or whatever)\r\n\r\n\r\n(beyond this, maybe it actually be possible to formalise the idea of registering equivalents in other languages, by actually writing those tags as \"c++::map\", \"haskell::Maybe\" etc etc, allowing automatic population of an inter-language equivalence table. extract a \"C++ user cheat sheet\", \"haskeller cheat sheet\" etc from columns of that)\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42698/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42698/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
