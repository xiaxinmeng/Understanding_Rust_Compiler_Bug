Furthermore, this lint more should be set to error by default (or perhaps warning, if people insist, but I generally feel like warnings should be errors by default, 'cause I'm strict like that).\n\nImplications:\n\nUnless the lint mode is disabled, you would have to ignore results explicitly, like this:\n\n```\nlet _ = some_function_whose_return_value_I_do_not_want_to_use();\n```\n\nThis subsumes #2965.  @catamorphism had proposed that we discuss this idea in the other issue, but I chose to make a separate issue for this because I think the title of the other is insufficient, and I wanted the issue to get re-emailed to everyone for discussion.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pnkfelix", "id": 173127, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173127?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix", "html_url": "https://github.com/pnkfelix", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2974/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2974/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
