See for example the syntax example taken from [octopress](http://octopress.org/docs/plugins/backtick-codeblock/):\n\n``````\n``` [language] [title] [url] [link text] [linenos:false] [start:#] [mark:#,#-#]\ncode snippet\n```\n``````\n\nHowever, `rustdoc` has a different interpretation for the (again optional) first word after the initial three ticks: it is used for an [directive](../blob/e2e754810c78a25c902b76c74ba8f04d0dcdc6f1/src/doc/rustdoc.md#defining-tests) regarding how to handle the given code when interpreted as a test.  Potential values for the directive include: `\"ignore\"`, `\"should_fail\"`, `\"no_run\"`\n\nIt would be better if we came up with some way to indicate these meta-data directives in a manner that was still compatible with using the language directives as indicated in the octopress system.\n\nAt the very least, we could treat any code block that has a string that is not one of the builtin rustdoc directives (like the three listed above) nor the string `\"rust\"` should be implicitly treated as `ignore`.  Then the author will retain the option of including the language name, and it will just get skipped by rustdoc when testing rust code blocks.\n\n(Other options include: find some other channel to use to communicate this information besides the initial three ticks.  A simple one would be instead following the final three ticks, though admittedly that may be too subtle.)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13947/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13947/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
