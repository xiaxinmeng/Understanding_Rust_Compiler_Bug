confusing by detecting the case where the formatted 'expected' and 'found' values are identical, and fallback to explicitly printing lifetimes when this happens. While this could result in more verbose error messages, it should help point users in the right direction. Currently, there's absolutely no indication that these issues result from a lifetime mismatch - users must either learn this from experience, or read the compiler internals.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73521/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73521/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
