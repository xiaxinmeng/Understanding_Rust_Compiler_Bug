message text:\r\n     > `Hi @*T-compiler/meeting* ; the triage meeting will be starting in H hours M minutes`\r\n   * Second topic name `pre-meeting triage YYYY-MM-DD #54818`; message text:\r\n     > I will be doing pre-triage in this channel.\r\n   * Right-click that first pre-triage message, choose \"Copy link to conversation\", then post that link into the weekly meeting channel, with text like:\r\n     > I will be doing `[pre-triage in a parallel topic](LINK-GOES-HERE)`\r\n    * If you haven't already, figure out which working groups (at most two) should do their check-in's this week. Consult the [WG checkin schedule][]. In any case, state on in meeting topic channel which WG's will be doing check-ins, and be sure to `@`-address the relevant leads as reminders to them.\r\n    * Switch now from the meeting channel to the pre-meeting triage channel, and do the pre-triage (see process with lists of issues below).\r\n      * If during the pre-triage you identify issues that are worth bubbling up to the larger group, post corresponding messages back on the meeting channel itself.\r\n  * When it is time for the meeting to start:\r\n    * Write `Hi @*T-compiler/meeting*! Add a :wave: emoji to show you're here :)` in the meeting channel to announce it is starting (and get an approximate attendees list).\r\n    * Immediately after starting the meeting, state that there are 5 minutes for general announcements that anyone can chime in on.\r\n\r\n# PERSISTENT URLs\r\n\r\n## Pre-triage Process\r\n\r\n * Unprioritized I-nominated issues [T-compiler][I-nominated T-compiler without P-label] and also [no team assigned][I-Nominated without P-label no team assigned] (for comparison see [all-teams][I-nominated without P-label all-teams]); prepass to identify candidates for P-high marking.\r\n   * As you traverse the nominated issues, be sure to remove nomination tags from issues where it is not clear whether there is actually a point to discuss.
