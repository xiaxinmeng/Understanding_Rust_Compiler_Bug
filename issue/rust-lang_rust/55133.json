Besides my own education the process has uncovered a few issues in my project where I can actually back-port fixes that are also relevant today with rust 1.27.2. Thanks for the 2018 improvements and `cargo fix`! \r\n\r\nI also found one limitation of the module/path changes that seems worth mentioning hear in case its an oversight, and because I can't find any other issue addressing it.  It seems as of the rust nightlies I'm testing I still, oddly, need to use `extern crate test` in the benches/*. \r\n\r\nGiven starting benches/*.rs benchmarks with the following:\r\n\r\n``` rust\r\n#![feature(test)]\r\nextern crate test;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs of rustc 1.30.0-nightly (\\5c875d938 2018-09-24), this produces a warning like in other places, as expected:\r\n``` text\r\nwarning: `extern crate` is not idiomatic in the new edition                                                                             \r\n--> benches/barc.rs:6:1                                                                                                                \r\n  |                                                                                                                                     \r\n6 | extern crate test;                                                    \r\n  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: convert it to a `use`                                                                                      \r\n  |                                                                                                                                     \r\n```\r\nHowever, as of rustc 1.31.0-nightly (\\4699283c5 2018-10-13), the warning goes away?\r\n\r\nNext, in both of these nightly releases, if I make the expected modification dropping `extern crate test` and `use test::Bencher` (see the change of dekellum/body-image@15b9789), I get the following error:\r\n\r\n``` text\r\nerror[E0432]: unresolved import `test`                                                                                                  \r\n  --> benches/async_streams.rs:12:5                                                                                                     \r\n   |                                                                                                                                    \r\n12 | use test::Bencher;                                                                                                                 \r\n   |     ^^^^ Could not find `test` in `{{root}}`                                                                                       \r\n```\r\n\r\nNote finally that I *was* able to remove all the other `extern crate` statements for the benches/* dependencies. \r\n\r\nI suspect the non-stable, nightly-only nature of libtest benchmarks somehow has contributed to this, but many projects include benches/*. Should this be fixed or at least noted as a shortcoming somewhere? \r\n\r\n### meta\r\n\r\n``` text\r\nrustc 1.31.0-nightly (4699283c5 2018-10-13)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 4699283c5b549d1559c198123a67fef498aa6a44\r\ncommit-date: 2018-10-13\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.31.0-nightly\r\nLLVM version: 8.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "petrochenkov", "id": 5751617, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTE2MTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5751617?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov", "html_url": "https://github.com/petrochenkov", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/petrochenkov/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55133/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55133/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
