Also, when should we switch to the normal (non-bootstrapping) gcc compiler and ld?\r\n\r\nWe tried: host&target i686 gcc & ld, host&target x86_64 gcc & ld, cross compiler with i686 host and x86_64 target, cross compiler with x86_64 host and i686 target.\r\n\r\nProblems were: Picking up the wrong glibc, picking up the wrong crt, picking up the wrong ld; (failure usually when trying to build the \"bootstrap\" crate).", "closed_by": {"login": "daym", "id": 7755349, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc3NTUzNDk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7755349?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/daym", "html_url": "https://github.com/daym", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daym/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daym/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daym/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daym/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daym/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daym/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daym/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daym/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/daym/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45593/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45593/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
