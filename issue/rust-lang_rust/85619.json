But it sows doubts about other methods nearby. For instance, `sort` shows up shortly after `make_ascii_lowercase`. Does `sort` apply only to u8 (it doesn't of course, but this is the potential confusion).", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85619/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85619/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
