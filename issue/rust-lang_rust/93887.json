In that\r\ncase, you can use use `issue = \"none\"` in your initial implementation PR. The\r\nreviewer will ask you to open a tracking issue if they agree your feature can be\r\nadded without an RFC.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a separate issue to track the potential deprecation of the `std::ascii`, `alloc::ascii`, and `core::ascii` modules, separated from #77174 [per this comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77174#issuecomment-1034149904). This issue will just say `std::ascii` for simplicity since, excluding the already-deprecated `AsciiExt` trait, these three modules are identical.\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\nRight now, `std::ascii` contains the following APIs:\r\n\r\n1. `trait AsciiExt` (already deprecated)\r\n2. `fn escape_default(b: u8) -> std::ascii::EscapeDefault` (now duplicated by inherent `u8::escape_ascii`)\r\n3. `struct EscapeDefault` (`impl Iterator` return value for `escape_default`, not re-exported anywhere)\r\n\r\nThe deprecation would involve:\r\n\r\n1. Deprecating `fn escape_default` (already moved to `u8::escape_ascii`)\r\n2. Re-exporting `struct EscapeDefault` somewhere else, presumably in `std::num`\r\n3. Deprecating `struct EscapeDefault` after its re-export is made stable\r\n4. Deprecating the entire `std::ascii` module\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor larger features, more steps might be involved.\r\nIf the feature is changed later, please add those PRs here as well.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSome of these may involve separate FCPs:\r\n\r\n- [x] Deprecation of `std::ascii::AsciiExt`: #49109\r\n- [x] Implementation of `u8::escape_ascii`: #77174\r\n- [ ] Deprecation of `std::ascii::escape_default` (not yet)\r\n- [ ] Rename of `std::ascii::EscapeDefault` (not yet)\r\n- [ ] Deprecation of `std::ascii::EscapeDefault` (not yet)\r\n- [ ] Deprecation of full `std::ascii` module (not yet)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOnce the feature has gone through a few release cycles and there are no\r\nunresolved questions left, the feature might be ready for stabilization.\r\n\r\nIf this feature didn't go through the RFC process, a final comment period\r\n(FCP) is always needed before stabilization. This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library API team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncomment period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n- Where should `std::ascii::EscapeDefault` be moved to? `std::num::EscapeAscii` seems the most logical, but there could be other options.\r\n- What effects would this have on the larger ecosystem? (crater runs?)\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "dtolnay", "id": 1940490, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDA0OTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1940490?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay", "html_url": "https://github.com/dtolnay", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93887/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93887/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
