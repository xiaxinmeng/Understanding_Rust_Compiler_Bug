The subject of a historical [security advisory](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rustlang-security-announcements/aZabeCMUv70) the API was [recently changed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/60902) to prevent memory unsafety issues on all channels including nightly. The functionality, however, is still unstable, so we should stabilize it at some point!\r\n\r\n## Original issue.\r\n\r\nReported by @seanmonstar to the security mailing list recently, it was discovered that the recent stabilization of `Error::type_id` in Rust 1.34.0 is actually not memory safe. Described in a [recent security announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rustlang-security-announcements/aZabeCMUv70) the stabilization of `Error::type_id` has been reverted for [stable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/60785), [beta](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/60786), and [master](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/60787).\r\n\r\nThis leaves us, however, with the question of what to do about this API? `Error::type_id` has been present since the inception of the `Error` trait, all the way back to 1.0.0. It's unstable, however, and is pretty rare as well to have a manual implementation of the `type_id` function. Despite this we would ideally still like a path to stability which includes safety at some point.\r\n\r\nThis tracking issue is intended to serve as a location to discuss this issue and determine the best way forward to fully removing `Error::type_id` (so even nightly users are not affected by this memory safety issue) and having a stable mechanism for the functionality.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60784/reactions", "total_count": 7, "+1": 7, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60784/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
