What happens instead is that for the closure, only the `000-*` and `001-*` passes are emitted; the `002-*` are missing. That's probably because they are not actually emitted into the binary, so they never get generated. I think that's a bug; one should expect `-Zdump-mir` to generate the MIR of all phases of all code.\r\n\r\n(I noticed this because I was adding a mir-opt test and it told me it couldn't find the file.)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43620/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43620/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
