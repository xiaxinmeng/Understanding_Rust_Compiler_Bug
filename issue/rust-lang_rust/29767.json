This is unnecessary for calls that cannot panic. We might consider adding a call rvalue. The plus side is that it permits fewer basic blocks and in particular permits avoiding the unwinding code. The minus side is that it means more than one way for a call to happen.\n\nAnother thing is that calls today always have two successors. But for fns of type `-> !`, they never return normally, so they should only have a panic successor.\n\nIt might be better to leave calls as always being terminators, but just have the number of successors be either 1 or 2. If the number of successors is 1, then the fn is either diverging (`-> !`), in which case this is a panic successor, or else it means the fn is known not to panic somehow. \n\ncc @Aatch you were mentioning this\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29767/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29767/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
