I. e. let me tell you my actual problem. I have a wrapper for `libc::read` called `read_repeatedly` with this signature: `pub fn read_repeatedly(fildes: c_int, buf: &mut [u8]) -> Result<&mut [u8], Errno>`. I tried to allocate a buffer so: `let mut buf = box [0u8; 10_000]`. I allocated it in heap, because I'm afraid of getting stack overflow. And I used `box` instead of `Box::new`, because I'm afraid that `Box::new([0u8; 10_000])` first allocates a buffer on stack and then moves it to box (I have read about this problem here: https://github.com/PoignardAzur/placement-by-return/blob/placement-by-return/text/0000-placement-by-return.md ). I used a box instead of vec, because I think one should always use box unless he really needs a vec.\r\n\r\nThen I did this: `read_repeatedly(socket2, &mut buf)`. And it did not work. I was able to fix the code so: `read_repeatedly(socket2, buf.as_mut())`. Still I think original code should work.\r\n\r\nYes, this bug is probably not a bug. I. e. the compiler probably works as intended. But still current behavior is confusing. I see clear path how the value should be coerced: `&mut Box<[u8; 10_000]>` -> `&mut [u8; 10_000]` -> `&mut [u8]`", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103665/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103665/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
