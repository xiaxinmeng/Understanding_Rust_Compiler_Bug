This is most noticeable in the context of my sort-of-REPL, which now exhibits noticeable pauses between entering commands due to constant recompiles. On my beefy desktop, compiling the standard HW:\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    io::println(\"hello, world!\");\n}\n```\n\ntakes around 0.4 seconds. I've spoken with @pcwalton briefly about this and he's acknowledged the issue and mentioned that he has ideas to mitigate it.\n\nHere's a more severe case: a fellow on IRC (MattCoder) has noted that on a Windows XP virtual machine, Hello World takes _more than a minute_ to compile. The machine is an Intel Core 2 Quad CPU Q8400 @ 2.66Ghz with 4GB RAM, and the virtual machine itself has 2GB. It should also be noted that the virtual machine runs VS2008 comfortably and compiles C and C# programs in the negligible time you would expect: http://postimage.org/image/o9y6d1znl/\n", "closed_by": {"login": "graydon", "id": 14097, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDk3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14097?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon", "html_url": "https://github.com/graydon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3216/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3216/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
