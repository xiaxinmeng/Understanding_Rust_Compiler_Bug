It makes code look awkward when you have something like `str::replace(foo, \"x\", \"y\").split_char('z')`.\n\nAdditionally, all of the docs are duplicated for the iface functions and most of them are just inlines of calling something on self.\n\nCan all of the code be moved to just use iface impls instead of regular functions?
