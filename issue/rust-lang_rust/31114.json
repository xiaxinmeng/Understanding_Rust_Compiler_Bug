Everything installed fine, but when I attempt to run either `rustc` or `cargo` (any subcommands) the commands just hang. This happens on Git Bash and cmd.exe both.\n\nI have to kill the command with Ctrl-C, but the `rustc.exe` process(es) does not end. I can't even kill it using task managers or admin-elevated cmd.exe prompts.\n\nThe only way to end the `rustc.exe` process is to reboot the computer and do your best not to attempt to run it again.\n\nThe `rustc.exe` processes that hang do not use any CPU or disk IO resources. They all reserve 312kB of private memory.\n\nWindows event logs state that the installation worked fine. `RUST_BACKTRACE=1 rustc` makes no change. There is no indication whatsoever anywhere telling me what is wrong.\n\nI'm attempting a reinstall right now. Rust documentation states that the installer is tested to work properly on Windows 7 64-bit, so this confuses me a little. Is the MSI installer a package that contains all dependencies or do I need to do something more to make it work?\n\nAdditionally I'm running ansicon.exe to color the output of Git Bash, but I have it mapped to a separate start command so Git Bash plainly does not use it.\n\nLet me know if more information is needed.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31114/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31114/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
