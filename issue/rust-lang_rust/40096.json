The following code holds onto the lock instead of dropping it:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet _lock = x.lock();\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found this surprising and was wholly unaware of this special meaning of the `_` name, and going by the reactions of @alexcrichton and others in #10488, I'm not the only one. It's not the most Google-able topic, but I wasn't able to find documentation of this except in the issue referenced above. I have to wonder how much Rust code out there has a landmine like this buried somewhere inside, undiscovered. Not the best look for a language aiming at safety and concurrency.\r\n\r\nI suggest doing one of the following:\r\n\r\n 1. Documenting this special behavior prominently, somewhere that isn't easy for newcomers to miss.\r\n 1. Warn about uses of `let _ = foo();`. One could argue that all such lines should be replaced by the more clear `foo();`.\r\n 1. The nuclear option: change the behavior of `let _ = ...` or remove it from the language entirely. Not likely post-stabilization and given that the previous discussion in #10488. However, I worry about Rust going the way of languages like C++ and accumulating a collection of misfeatures and \"don't touch this\" areas due to legacy reasons.", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40096/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 1, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40096/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
