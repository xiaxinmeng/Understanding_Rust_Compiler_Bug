We also believe that we should have a compile-time lint that detects this whenever possible, since at some level the compiler should know at compile time if code invokes `size_of_val` or `align_of_val` on an `extern type`.\r\n\r\nI've opened this separate issue to document that decision, and will propose FCP on it to give time for final comments.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/49708/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/49708/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
