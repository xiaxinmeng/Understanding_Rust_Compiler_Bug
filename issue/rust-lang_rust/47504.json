I believe that the current approach of actively checking for this and not fail is very reasonable in beta and stable `rustc`, but in nightly builds I would like to have an assertion so that we expose this incorrectly formatted spans so that the underlying cause can be fixed.\r\n\r\nThis might take the form of a simple assert and ICEing (not my preference, but it would certainly bring attention to the problem) to generating a diagnostic error and emitting it, allowing the compiler to continue working, but making the problem visible to anyone using the nightly compiler, with text prompting a report in this issue tracker. If we go down the later route, it probably should be a warning, so that anyone using the nightly compiler in production isn't stopped from using it due to a `rustc` bug.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47504/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47504/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
