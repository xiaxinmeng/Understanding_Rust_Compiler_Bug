Since this was supported before anyway, we remove the special case of statics being referencable both via a `Place` and via a constant.\r\n\r\nThis change may have broken how stacked borrows process references to statics. We should run miri on a few examples and see whether the borrows assigned change in a significant way.\r\n\r\nrelated discussion on zulip: https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/146212-t-compiler.2Fconst-eval/topic/promoteds.20are.20not.20places", "closed_by": {"login": "RalfJung", "id": 330628, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDYyOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/330628?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung", "html_url": "https://github.com/RalfJung", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RalfJung/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/miri/issues/1122/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/miri/issues/1122/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
