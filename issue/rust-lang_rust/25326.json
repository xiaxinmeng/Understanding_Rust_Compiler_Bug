If that yields an error, it's a bug.\"\n\nSo I checked.  It does not yield the error.\n\nHere is the text in question:\n\nThe value of static and const variables must be known at compile time. You can't cast a pointer as an integer because we can't know what value the address will take.\n\nHowever, pointers to other constants' addresses are allowed in constants, example:\n\n```\nconst X: u32 = 50;\nconst Y: *const u32 = &X;\n```\n\nTherefore, casting one of these non-constant pointers to an integer results in a non-constant integer which lead to this error. Example:\n\n```\nconst X: u32 = 50;\nconst Y: *const u32 = &X;\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", Y);\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25326/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25326/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
