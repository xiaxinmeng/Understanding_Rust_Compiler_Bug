However, if we add a `let temp = is_prime(x) || continue;` the `temp` would be always true, if `is_prime(x)` is true it will be short-circuited with true, and otherwise it would be diverge and we will never see anything other than true. It is like warning unused_must_use on `Result<(), !>` which it is always `Ok(())` and using it is pointless. So is it good to turn off this warning? Or current behavior is intended?\r\n\r\nI see that this isn't a good code, but unused_must_use isn't a good warning for preventing that. Another warning (probably in clippy) can say that `please don't abuse short circuit operators`.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Dylan-DPC", "id": 99973273, "node_id": "U_kgDOBfV4mQ", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99973273?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC", "html_url": "https://github.com/Dylan-DPC", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88017/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88017/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "not_planned"}
