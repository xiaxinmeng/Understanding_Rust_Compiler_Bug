I think that these docs should all be on [The Rust Forge](https://forge.rust-lang.org/).\r\n\r\nThis issue is intended as a clearing house to track things that it would be useful to document.

Also feel free to open a separate issue on a particular topic (and link to it from here).\r\n\r\n- [ ] How to build the compiler and how to run the compiler you built\r\n    - First off, explaining about `--stage 1` and `--incremental` arguments\r\n    - Then, once you run `./x.py build --incremental`, it's not obvious where to find compiled executable or how to run it\r\n    - For bonus points, we could publish some kind of rustup toolchain instructions, so that you can just type `rustc` and have it work (that's how my setup works, at least, I should document it publicly)\r\n- [ ] Advice on effective use of `RUST_LOG`\r\n    - Common modules you may want to log\r\n    - Direct the output into a file\r\n    - `-Z verbose` for more details\r\n- [ ] A list of the various debugging outputs the compiler supports (--unpretty, MIR dump, CGU partitions, dep-graph etc) (from [this comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/40902#issuecomment-290100955))\r\n     - which commandline arguments or environment variables are needed to generate them\r\n     - the kind of filtering they support (e.g. just dump MIR for one function)", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40902/reactions", "total_count": 8, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 6, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40902/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
