The goal of\r\nthis page is describe why this change was made and how you can fix\r\ncode that is affected by it. It also provides a place to ask questions\r\nor register a complaint if you feel the change should not be made. For\r\nmore information on the policy around future-compatibility warnings,\r\nsee our [breaking change policy guidelines](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1589-rustc-bug-fix-procedure.md).\r\n#### What is the warning for?\r\n\r\nRust 1.0 accepted a number of patterns -- and in particular accepted constant in patterns --\r\nin a broader range of situations that was originally intended. [RFC 1445](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1445) spelled out\r\nsome restrictions on what kinds of constants can be used in patterns, at least until the\r\nfinal semantics are affirmatively decided. The intention is that user-defined `struct` and\r\n`enum` types can only be used in match patterns if they **derive** the `PartialEq` and `Eq`\r\ntraits (note that the traits must be automatically derived using `#[derive(...)]`, they cannot\r\nbe implemented by hand).\r\n\r\nThis means that a match like this is illegal:\r\n\r\n``` rust\r\nstruct Foo { x: u32 }\r\nconst BAR: Foo = Foo { x: 0 };\r\nlet foo = Foo { x: 0 };\r\nmatch foo {\r\n    BAR => ...,\r\n    _ => ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make it legal, add `#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]` to the `Foo` struct.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this restriction is that pattern matching does not\r\nactually invoke the `Eq` methods defined in those traits.\r\nInstead, internally, it compares each field deeply and recursively.\r\nIf you are using `#[derive]`, this is guaranteed to be equivalent\r\nto invoking the methods by hand. But if you are not using `#[derive]`,\r\nthen the `Eq` comparison method could do arbitrary things.\r\n#### When will this warning become a hard error?\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each 6-week release cycle, the Rust compiler team\r\nwill review the set of outstanding future compatibility warnings and\r\nnominate some of them for **Final Comment Period**. Toward the end of\r\nthe cycle, we will review any comments and make a final determination\r\nwhether to convert the warning into a hard error or remove it\r\nentirely.\r\n#### Current status\r\n- [x] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/32199 introduces the `illegal_struct_or_enum_constant_pattern` lint as warn-by-default\r\n- [x] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/36894 makes the `illegal_struct_or_enum_constant_pattern` lint deny-by-default\r\n- [x] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/42136 makes the `illegal_struct_or_enum_constant_pattern` lint a hard error\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36891/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36891/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
