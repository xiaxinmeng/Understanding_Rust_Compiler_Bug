If I create a `#[bench]` function that has the same name as an `extern crate`, then rustc claims that \"extern crate `foo` is private\".\n\nHere's a minimal example that reproduces this bug:\n\n``` rust\n// ducks.rs\n#![feature(test)]\nextern crate test;\nextern crate geese;\n\n#[bench]\nfn geese(_: &mut test::Bencher) {}\n```\n\n`geese.rs` is an empty file.\n\n```\n$ rustc geese.rs --crate-type rlib\n$ rustc ducks.rs --test --extern geese=libgeese.rlib\nwarning: extern crate `geese` is private, and cannot be reexported (error E0364), consider declaring with `pub`, #[warn(private_in_public)] on by default\n  |\n  = warning: this was previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error in a future release!\n  = note: for more information, see issue #34537 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/34537>\n```\n\nThe warning disappears if I either (a) rename the bench function, or (b) remove the `#[bench]` attribute.\n\nUsing `rustc 1.13.0-nightly (4f9812a59 2016-09-21)`, installed on Arch Linux x64 via rustup.
