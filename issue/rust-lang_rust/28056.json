Having a table of contents would help a lot with this.\n\nHere is a list of links to different TOC styles from various places for ways it could be done:\n- [Python 2.7](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html) has one in the sidebar. Stays with you as you scroll.\n- [Python 3.5](https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/introduction.html) seems to be slightly cleaner but similar. Doesn't stay with you.\n- [mozilla javascript docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions): is nicely in the sidebar. Follows you down the page (requires the window to be wide enough).\n- [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat): in the middle of the page. Doesn't scroll with you. \n- [gitbook](http://rustbyexample.com/): stays with you. provides scrolling.\n- [perl](http://perldoc.perl.org/perl.html): looks like it's formatted like a man page.\n\nI looked for some more but didn't find other good examples.\n\nOf these, I like the mozilla, python 2, and gitbook TOCs best with the mozilla probably the best among them (probably because it's small and clean). However, I think the gitbook style is probably the most appropriate fit to the std libs style.\n\nI've also provided a mockups of what a TOC could look like in that style which is similar to a [different thread](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/rustdoc-mockup-for-including-more-structured-content/2540). Clearly, something would need to be done with the current sidebar to use this format.\n\nMockup:\n\n![toc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4156987/9537217/e8e5fac2-4d03-11e5-9015-64ca37e752f1.png)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28056/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28056/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
