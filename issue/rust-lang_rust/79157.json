I had some nested logic with early returns and while at the moment it could not get to the end of the function, I could predict that some changes to the logic might miss a branch and then it would get to the end of the function - I wanted to catch that future mistake with an unreaachable!() macro. If we don't warn about unreachable unreachable!'s then I think that will make rust a safer language to code in as we can code more defensively.\r\n\r\n```\r\nwarning: unreachable statement\r\n    --> src/<snip>.rs:1298:5\r\n     |\r\n1190 |                         return None;\r\n     |                         ----------- any code following this expression is unreachable\r\n...\r\n1298 |     unreachable!(\"Case missed.
