For example, to find how to test the standard library, you'd have to go from the README -> CONTRIBUTING -> https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/ -> notice \"Testing the compiler\" in the sidebar and realize it might be relevant to the standard library too. We should improve several of these steps, but the easiest one is to link directly to the rustc-dev-guide from the README.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, CONTRIBUTING.md still has some information that's not on the top-level \"Getting Started\" page in the dev-guide; in particular, rustc-dev-guide doesn't link to std-dev-guide until way down in \"other places to find information\": https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/about-this-guide.html?highlight=std-dev-guide#other-places-to-find-information. We should make this more prominent, and then we can update the README to link directly.\r\n\r\ncc https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/122652-new-members/topic/testing.20library.2Fcore", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110144/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110144/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
