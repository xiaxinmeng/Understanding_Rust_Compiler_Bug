For example, `#[doc(alias = 42)]` will trigger this lint, since `42` is not a string. Also, `#[doc(foobar)]` will trigger this lint.\r\n\r\nIf you are here because of a warning about `doc(primitive)`, see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/88070 instead.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Original issue\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82702: Currently the warning reuses the existing `unknown_attributes` lint, but to properly do future incompatibility we need to use the special infrastructure that exists for it.\r\n\r\nWe should also consider sticking this into the edition (see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80165), though I'm not sure if it can be automatically upgraded. This might be one of the cases where it doesn't matter.", "closed_by": {"login": "Manishearth", "id": 1617736, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc3MzY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1617736?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth", "html_url": "https://github.com/Manishearth", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82730/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82730/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "reopened"}
