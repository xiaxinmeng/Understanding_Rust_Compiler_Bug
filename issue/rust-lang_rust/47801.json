It took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that struct definitions are perfectly clickable. So for several months while learning Rust I eagerly waited for Rust's docs to be updated with info about their struct definitions.\r\n\r\nI have no idea if this is a widespread phenomenon, but remarkably the cognitive dissonance still lingers. I'm also not certain if this warrants filing an issue.
