The solution here is to manually specify a higher recursion limit via the `recursion_limit` attribute.\r\n\r\nThis does mean that the attribute ends up in a bit of a weird situation though, since `recursion_limit` also affects macro expansions which has a default value of 1024. So any explicitly set value between 64 and 1024 actually ends up reducing the recursion limit for macros.\r\n\r\nI assume that there is a good reason for the monomorphization limit being so low compared to the macro limit. But if that is the case then it is perhaps a bit problematic that any increase of the limit for the sake of macro expansion will actually also end up increasing it for monomorphizations as well, only it is increased by a factor of 20 or more.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nI don't think there is anything that is actually directly actionable in this issue now that I have written it out. But I figure I should still post this as I did end up being rather confused by the fact that setting the recursion_limit to 1024 actually fixed the issue in toml_edit, despite the fact that I remember it being increased to 1024 some time ago (only when I dug up the [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/41676) did I realize it was only for macros)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51951/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/51951/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
