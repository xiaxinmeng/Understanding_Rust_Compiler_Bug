Rust should be able to run on threads started from C without giving up the concurrency libraries. Higher-level abstractions can be built upon the primitives provided by the standard library, but it's not the place of the standard library to force subjective high-level design decisions with overhead onto applications.\n\nThe native model has both detached threads without the overhead of synchronization between the parent and child (as there is no hierarchy) and threads represented by objects that are joined in the destructor to avoid the need for additional synchronization primitives like channels in common cases. Rust needs to move to a model like this in order to complete the runtime removal RFC.\n\nThe API also uses `proc`, which is probably going to change before 1.0 because it will be replaced as as a distinct type by `Box<FnOnce<...>>`. It might stay around as a form of sugar but marking any API using the old closures as stable is premature.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18000/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18000/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
