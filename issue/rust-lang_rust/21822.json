It makes it easier to have alternative standard libraries, and the compilers shouldn't really link with it automatically anyway. It also makes it easier to build for new targets, making cross compilation multiple grades of magnitude easier. \n\nThe standard library requires on a rust version, but implementing a rustc version requirement shouldn't be too hard. \n\nThe only argument I've so far heard against this, is that it'd require people to update their Cargo.lock if they are using cargo, or manually update the std if they are not. While this is true, most people _will_ be using cargo or a dependency manager, and updating the lock file shouldn't be an issue.\n\nToday I heard rust prefers explicit over implicit. Not implicitly linking against all the standard libraries would follow this. \n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21822/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/21822/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
