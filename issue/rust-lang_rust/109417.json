The idea is to allow implementation work to proceed to better inform an upcoming RFC. **Experimental features cannot be stabilized without first having an RFC.** The existence of an experimental feature does not indicate lang team consensus that the feature is desirable, only that there is the problem is worthy of being solved and that the idea has enough merit to consider exploring. See [the lang team process page](https://lang-team.rust-lang.org/how_to/experiment.html) for more details.\r\n\r\n### About tracking issues\r\n\r\nTracking issues are used to record the overall progress of implementation.\r\nThey are also used as hubs connecting to other relevant issues, e.g., bugs or open design questions.\r\nA tracking issue is however *not* meant for large scale discussion, questions, or bug reports about a feature.\r\nInstead, open a dedicated issue for the specific matter and add the relevant feature gate label.\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n<!--\r\nInclude each step required to complete the feature. Typically this is a PR\r\nimplementing a feature, followed by a PR that stabilises the feature. However\r\nfor larger features an implementation could be broken up into multiple PRs.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implement the feature (#109010)\r\n- [ ] Author RFC\r\n- [ ] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][doc-guide])\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][stabilization-guide])\r\n\r\n[stabilization-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr\r\n[doc-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#documentation-prs\r\n\r\n### Experimental results\r\n\r\nPart of the goal of the experimental process is to identify benefits but also concerns that need to be addressed in the RFC.
