It (typically) carries the same meaning as having no region at all. This section summarizes its usage, giving pointers to tests, and also listing known blocking issues.\r\n\r\n- `fn foo(x: Ref<'_>)` -- fresh name\r\n- `fn foo(&self) -> Ref<'_>` -- links to `self`\r\n- `fn foo(&self) -> Box<dyn Debug + '_>` -- links to `self`, not quite the same as `Box<dyn Debug>`\r\n    - **blocked** on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48468\r\n- `fn foo(&self) -> Box<impl Debug + '_>` -- links to `self`, not quite the same as `Box<impl Debug>`\r\n\r\nSome areas where elision *ought* to be supported are not yet:\r\n\r\n- `impl Foo for Ref<'_>` -- not yet implemented, this is #15872\r\n- `where T: Trait<'_>` -- not yet implemented, this is https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/45667\r\n    - also, what semantics are desired here? Where is the binder?\r\n\r\nThere are also several linted scenarios to nudge the user in the right direction:\r\n\r\n- Eliding parameters of a lifetime-parameterized struct (e.g., `Ref`) is deprecated, prefer `Ref<'_>`\r\n    - `#[warn(elided_lifetimes_in_paths)]`\r\n    - **blocked** on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48385 -- triggers for `format!`\r\n- Lifetime names used only once are deprecated:\r\n    - `#[warn(single_use_lifetime)]`\r\n    - **blocked** on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44752 -- only partially impemented\r\n\r\n### Changes or clarifications to the RFC\r\n\r\nThe behavior around `dyn Trait` is probably worth highlighting, since it is one case where `'_` differs from writing nothing at all.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48469/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/48469/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
