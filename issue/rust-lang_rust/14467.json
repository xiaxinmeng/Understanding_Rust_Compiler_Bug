This does not support the use case of a child outliving the parent (such as creating a daemon).\n\nA new method should be added to the `Process` type, perhaps `detach`, which consumes the `Process` and cancels the call to `wait` in the destructor. Something along the lines of:\n\n``` rust\n// Forgets this process, allowing it to outlive the parent\n//\n// This function will forcefully prevent calling `wait()` on the child\n// process in the destructor, allowing the child to outlive the \n// parent. Note that this operation can easily lead to leaking the\n// resources of the child process, so care must be taken when\n// invoking this method.\npub fn detach(self) { /* ... */ }\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/14467/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/14467/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
