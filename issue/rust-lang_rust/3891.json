While it is understandable due to the way it has been implemented, this is incorrect behaviour.  `read(...)` for the same implementation is able to determine when the end-of-file has been reached, and therefore `eof()` should be able to as well.\n\nSecond, `read_byte()` of this implementation will `fail` if no data is read from the buffer.  While somewhat understandable behaviour, this breaks the use of `ReaderUtil::read_line()`, which calls `read_byte()` repeatedly until it finds an end-of-line or end-of-file.  Looking through other implementations of `read_byte()` in `io.rs`, it appears that the standard behaviour is to return `-1` when end-of-file has been reached.  I suggest that we should do the same here, and assume that we have reached the end of the file when no more bytes are read.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3891/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3891/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
