However, `librustdoc` internally [captures](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/0d82fb55dbb9b28798ea7c2004fa91fe3ae23b86/src/librustdoc/test.rs#L247) the output of doc-tests and doesn\u2019t let it get through to `libtest`. Consequently, the usage of `--nocapture` in this context is somewhat limited (when supplied it reveals compiler warnings, for instance) and doesn\u2019t serve its main purpose. This behavior is inconsistent with the rest of the testing.\n\nRegards,\nIvan\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/26309/reactions", "total_count": 20, "+1": 20, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/26309/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
