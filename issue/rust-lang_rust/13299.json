An old [rust-dev thread on getters and setters](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2012-July/thread.html#2154) defended the lack of such by saying that Haskell and ML are fine without them. I think that this defense might be misleading, and I still believe that it would be worth it for Rust to have properties.\n\nHaskell does not have properties because it is a functional language, but it _does_ require the use of functions to access the individual fields of a type. It has the [record syntax](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/More_on_datatypes#Named_Fields_.28Record_Syntax.29) to generate these accessors for you in order to cut down on boilerplate. As far as I know, Rust lacks the equivalent of even this. Haskell also has [lenses](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) to make this even easier.\n\nIt is important that Rust distinguish itself from the tried-and-true C and C++ languages by eliminating boilerplate/generated code. My worry is that developers simply won't see much advantage in learning a new language otherwise. I believe that if an equivalent of Scala's unapply method is necessary to keep pattern matching working correctly, it would be worth it.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13299/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/13299/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
