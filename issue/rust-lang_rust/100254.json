However, supporting this feature makes other parts of rustdoc's UI worse: Currently, rustdoc makes headers link to themselves (to make grabbing a link to the header easier). If we supported user links in headers, this wouldn't work anymore. We could use \u201c\u00a7\u201d, but it presents a small click target and adds visual noise.
