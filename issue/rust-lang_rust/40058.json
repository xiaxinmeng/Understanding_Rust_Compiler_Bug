This is unfortunate, because it's wasteful to reallocate when the required capacity would fit within the current jemalloc allocation but `RawVec` just doesn't know.\r\n\r\nAs far as abstraction leakage goes, it would be better to let the leakage stop at `RawVec` than to have [higher-level code try to second-guess `RawVec` with assumptions about the underlying allocator](https://github.com/hsivonen/encoding_rs/issues/6).\r\n\r\nI suggest that the allocator crate provide a rounding function for rounding up to the largest allocation size that would consume as much space in the underlying allocator as the requested size and `RawVec` use it to round up capacity. For jemalloc, the rounding function would round to the jemalloc bucket size.", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40058/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40058/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
