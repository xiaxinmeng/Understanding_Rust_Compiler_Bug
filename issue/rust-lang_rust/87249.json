It seems this approach allows parsing 8 digits at once instead of parsing one digit at a time which is what the algorithm in `core` currently does for integer to string conversion:\r\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/num/mod.rs.html#843\r\nPerhaps this new algorithm can then be reused in some form or another in the float parsing algorithm for more code reusage.\r\n\r\nHere is a proof of concept program making use of the final algorithm at the bottom of the **Fast numeric string to int** article:\r\n```rs\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let num = b\"12345678\";\r\n\r\n    let mut sum = unsafe { *(num as *const u8 as *mut i64) };\r\n    sum = (sum & 0xf0f0f0f0f0f0f0f).wrapping_mul(2561) >> 8;\r\n    sum = (sum & 0xff00ff00ff00ff).wrapping_mul(6553601) >> 16;\r\n    sum = (sum & 0xffff0000ffff).wrapping_mul(42949672960001) >> 32;\r\n\r\n    dbg!(sum);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\n[src/main.rs:7] sum = 12345678\r\n```", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87249/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87249/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
