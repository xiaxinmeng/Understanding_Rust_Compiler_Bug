This is a convenience method to make it easier to get the hash of a value, such as when implementing a hash table or when writing unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor most library features, it'd be useful to include a summarized version of the public API.\r\n(E.g. just the public function signatures without their doc comments or implementation.)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub trait BuildHasher { // existing trait\r\n    fn hash_one<T: Hash>(&self, x: T) -> u64\r\n    where\r\n        Self: Sized; // new method, with provided implementation\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor larger features, more steps might be involved.\r\nIf the feature is changed later, please add those PRs here as well.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/86151\r\n- [x] Add missing `Self: Sized`: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/88031\r\n- [ ] Final commenting period (FCP)\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOnce the feature has gone through a few release cycles and there are no\r\nunresolved questions left, the feature might be ready for stabilization.\r\n\r\nIf this feature didn't go through the RFC process, a final commenting period\r\n(FCP) is always needed before stabilization. This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncommenting period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- None yet.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86161/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 5, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86161/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
