It would be really nice if we could test that we don't accidentally regress the JSON output (or the other output for that matter; I suspect most breakage affects both backends).\r\n\r\nI think the easiest way to do this is to add a new `tests/rustdoc-semver-checks` submodule with a dependency on https://github.com/obi1kenobi/cargo-semver-checks. Then in `src/bootstrap/test.rs`, we'll add a new test suite that runs `cargo test` on cargo-semver-checks using the in-tree version of rustdoc to make sure there's no incompatibilities.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how this should deal with breaking changes to the JSON format - maybe we can use [toolstate](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/toolstate.html) which allows the tests to be broken until semver-checks supports the new version?\r\n\r\ncc @obi1kenobi @rust-lang/rustdoc", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110815/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/110815/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
