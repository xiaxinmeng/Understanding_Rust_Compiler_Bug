And in particular, whether there is a desire or plan to stabilize it, whether there are alternatives, etc.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure it'd be efficient if I\u00a0were a middleman in all these exchanges, so maybe just answer there?\r\n\r\nAnyway, here it is, thank you for all you do on rustdoc anyway and whatever the result of this conversation ends up being!", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73185/reactions", "total_count": 21, "+1": 21, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/73185/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
