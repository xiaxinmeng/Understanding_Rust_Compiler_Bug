However, @Veedrac has recently demonstrated that a simple, obvious, not-correct-in-general implementation is easily [5x faster](https://gist.github.com/Veedrac/dbb0c07994bc7882098e) than the current \"fast path\". I am certain this can be improved, if not to equal performance then at least to something between 1x and 2x.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the slow path is very slow indeed. Here it's less a question of micro optimization and more of smart algorithms. The [glibc approach](http://www.exploringbinary.com/how-glibc-strtod-works/) sounds promising and would also solve a long-standing issue of not being able to handle some pathological inputs. There's no better implementation to benchmark against, other than perhaps `libc::strtod`, so I have no idea how much room for improvement there is and when this issue could be considered \"closed\".
