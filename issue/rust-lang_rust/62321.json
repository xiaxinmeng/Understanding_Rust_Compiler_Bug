More precisely, it causes us to allocate storage for `x` twice (once for `x`, and once for the `pinned` variable that `x` is moved into inside the `await`).\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate state of events is caused by the fact that we cannot \"peer into\" `size_of_val` and see that the address of `x` never escapes the function. Without knowing this, we can't optimize away the storage of `x` once it has been moved.\r\n\r\nThis was first discussed here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/59123#issuecomment-501401232. One promising solution ([suggested](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/59123#issuecomment-501472425) by @RalfJung) is that we inline all occurrences of `size_of_val` (and possibly some other intrinsics) in a MIR pass, before we get to the generator transform.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62321/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 4, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62321/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
