It highlights the matches and doesn't require as much deeper nesting. After getting used to the F# style, the inability to do this is rust seems a bit limiting.\n\nI'm not sure if this issue should be in this repo or not but just direct me if I have to move it.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mdinger", "id": 4156987, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQxNTY5ODc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4156987?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/mdinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36361/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36361/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
