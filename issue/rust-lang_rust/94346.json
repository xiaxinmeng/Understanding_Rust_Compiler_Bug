This results in the inlined docs for `Bytestream` having a broken link to `Stream`, which can be observed [in these docs](https://docs.rs/aws-sdk-s3/0.7.0/aws_sdk_s3/types/struct.ByteStream.html) (where it says \"Via impl Stream\").\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n\r\nObserved this with stable rustdoc 1.56.1 and rustdoc 1.61.0-nightly (4b043faba 2022-02-24).", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94346/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94346/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
