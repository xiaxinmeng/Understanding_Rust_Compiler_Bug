`#![feature(if_while_or_patterns)]`.\r\n\r\nOriginally proposed in RFC https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2175, then amended by https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2530, implemented (partially, see below) in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/48490 by @petrochenkov, and available in nightly since ~25th February, `#![feature(if_while_or_patterns)]` permits users to write multiple \"or patterns\" `A(x) | B` in `if let`, `while let`, `for` expressions and `let` statements.\r\n\r\nSee the [motivation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2175-if-while-or-patterns.md#motivation) for an extended discussion; The primary reasons why this is useful are:\r\n\r\n+ It permits more expressive and ergonomic control flow.\r\n\r\n+ It is consistent with the behaviour of `match` expressions.\r\n\r\n### Version target\r\n\r\nThe next version is 1.32 which goes into beta the 7th of December; It is quite possible that this will slip into 1.33 however depending on how long the review process takes.\r\n\r\n### What is stabilized\r\n\r\n- [Feature gate](https://github.com/petrochenkov/rust/blob/8640a51ff8d580bbb87aa3dc0ff8bacbad111010/src/test/ui/feature-gate-if_while_or_patterns.rs) and [in the code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/48490/files#diff-8fe611e80215042c8d89714f4dd6f8ba).\r\n- Tests\r\n  - [/src/test/run-pass/rfc-2175-or-if-while-let/basic.rs](https://github.com/petrochenkov/rust/blob/8640a51ff8d580bbb87aa3dc0ff8bacbad111010/src/test/run-pass/rfc-2175-or-if-while-let/basic.rs)\r\n\r\nUsers are now permitted to write for example:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nenum Thing { Alpha, Beta(u8), Gamma }\r\n\r\nif let Thing::Alpha | Thing::Gamma = Thing::Gamma {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nif let 0 | 1 = 0 { ... } else { ... }\r\n\r\nlet mut iter = make_thing_iter();\r\nwhile let | Thing::Beta(_) | Thing::Gamma = iter.next() {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPer https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2530, leading vertical bars (`|`) are permitted; however, this behaviour cannot be observed on nightly right now. This is a fairly minor thing that will need to be fixed (+ test) in the stabilization PR.\r\n\r\nEDIT: A clarification: you *can* write `if let A(x) | B(x) = expr { ... }`. In other words, bindings *do* work.\r\n\r\n### What is not\r\n\r\nUsers are not yet permitted to write:\r\n\r\n- `if let A(0 | 1) = expr { ... }`;\r\n\r\n  This is the generalization of or-patterns as provided for by https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2535. @varkor is currently working on an implementation for that generalization.\r\n\r\n- `let Ok(x) | Err(x) = expr;` or `for Ok(x) | Err(x) in iter { ... }`.\r\n  This is provided for by the RFC but the implementation was more complex so this will be implemented in the future, possibly by @varkor in the generalization.\r\n\r\n  **This is a divergence from the RFC** since a *subset* of the RFC is implemented.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Centril", "id": 855702, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTcwMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/855702?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril", "html_url": "https://github.com/Centril", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56212/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56212/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
