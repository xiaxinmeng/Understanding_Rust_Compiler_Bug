(I.e., this bug broke my attempts to bootstrap Rust itself with `debuginfo-level = 2` in the `config.toml`. But the test suite itself is not exercising `-g` enough to observe that combination.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, PR's that are making changes to debuginfo should be going through the process of bootstrapping with `debuginfo-level = 2`, as a sanity check.\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94262/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94262/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
