Example:\n\n``` rust\n// this FAILS because left is [195, 191]\nassert_eq!( bytes!( \"\\xFF\"), bytes!( 255 ) ); \n// this SUCCEEDS\nassert_eq!( bytes!( \"\\xFF\"), bytes!( \"\\u00FF\" ) );  \n```\n\nI understand the reasoning behind this (Rust strings are always UTF-8), but then `\\xXX` shouldn't exist in the language. It brings nothing but confusion and it's functionality as implemented is the same as `\\u00XX`.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "rust-highfive", "id": 7378925, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjczNzg5MjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7378925?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-highfive", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12769/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12769/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
