Thus, `foo.js not found` (as a program to run).)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSo, workarounds exists, but the overall experience is pretty bad in terms of running the `run-make` tests. This is perhaps to be expected given that [wasm is a tier-2 target](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html#tier-2). It might be worth considering adding a prerequisite to the relevant wasm run-make tests that does a trivial dummy run of the basics, and if it fails, spits out an error telling the developer what changes they should make if they want to do `run-make` tests with this target enabled.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/109132/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/109132/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
