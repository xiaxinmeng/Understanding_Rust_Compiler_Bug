This enables many ergonomics, but trying to input a plain `InvariantType` into the function conflicts with the blanket `impl TryFrom<T> for T` which has a return type `!` instead of `Error = MyErrorType`.\r\n\r\nSince `!` can and will coerce into anything through a future [`impl<T> From<!> for T` ](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/64715) , and there is a current workaround:\r\n```\r\nimpl From<Infallible> for MyError {\r\n    fn from(_: Infallible) -> Self {\r\n        unreachable!()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nit should work, but adding this to the playground link does not change the error message at all.\r\n\r\nAlso in the playground link, there is a nearly identical error related to a `From<NonZeroUsize> for BitWidth` and its blanket impls. In that case, I can't even apply the attempted workaround because of orphan rules.", "closed_by": {"login": "jonas-schievink", "id": 1786438, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY0Mzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786438?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonas-schievink", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69448/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69448/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
