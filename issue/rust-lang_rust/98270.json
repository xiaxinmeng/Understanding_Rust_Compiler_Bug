For example, [`Vec::reserve_exact`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.reserve_exact) mentions [`Vec::reserve`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.reserve).\r\n\r\nIn almost all of these cases, the method being linked doesn't include the full type or `Self::` in the actual text, and has to resort to copying the method name with `Self::` in the link destination.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if rustdoc automatically resolved these links without the need to add the extra `Self::` prefix. For example, writing ``[`reserve`]`` should automatically resolve to `Self::reserve` if a `reserve` item doesn't exist on its own. If both the method and the standalone item exist, we could add a lint to point out the ambiguity, requiring the user to clarify either `self::reserve` or `Self::reserve`; this feels like the best move to avoid changing the existing behaviour.\r\n\r\nEither way, this pattern feels very common and seems like a papercut that makes documentation just a little bit harder to write.", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/98270/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/98270/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "not_planned"}
