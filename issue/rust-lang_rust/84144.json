That suggests the programmer should take a moment to think of alternatives before continuing.\r\n\r\nThe current message regarding mutable variables seems quite direct, as if it might be the only solution.  Perhaps in some cases it will be, but encouraging use of immutable variables is probably - generally - a good thing.\r\n\r\nOne drawback with this suggestion would be that it is less concise.
