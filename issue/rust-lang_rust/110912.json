\ud83d\udc1b A regression is something that changed between versions of Rust but was not supposed to.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short summary of the regression, along with any information you feel is relevant to replicate it.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n\r\nI tried this code in a library used in build.rs\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n        // Static QML plugin and Qt resource initialization need to be linked with +whole-archive\r\n        // because they use static variables which need to be initialized before main\r\n        // (regardless of whether main is in Rust or C++). Normally linkers only copy symbols referenced\r\n        // from within main when static linking, which would result in discarding those static variables.\r\n        // Use a separate cc::Build for the little amount of code that needs to be linked with +whole-archive\r\n        // to avoid bloating the binary.\r\n        let mut cc_builder_whole_archive = cc::Build::new();\r\n        cc_builder_whole_archive.link_lib_modifier(\"+whole-archive\");\r\n        ...\r\n        // cc::Build::file and cc::Build::compile are called on cc_builder_whole_archive later\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Cargo.toml:\r\n```\r\n[lib]\r\ncrate-type = [\"staticlib\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected to see this happen: build succeeds, but `+whole-archive` effectively does nothing because the final link of the executable is done by an external build system (CMake in this case)\r\n\r\nInstead, this happened: build fails with\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: link modifiers combination `+bundle,+whole-archive` is unstable when generating rlibs\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/issues/519\r\n\r\n### Version it worked on\r\n\r\nIt most recently worked on: 1.68\r\n\r\n### Version with regression\r\n\r\n1.69.0\r\n\r\n### Backtrace\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nAdd `-bundle` link modifier:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ncc_builder_whole_archive.link_lib_modifier(\"-bundle\");\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/pull/520\r\n\r\nNeither +bundle nor -bundle seem to make much sense for a staticlib which is built by cc rather than rustc, so adding `-bundle` doesn't seem to have any downside for CXX-Qt's purposes.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nThe CXX-Qt build system supports building two ways:\r\n  * Rust staticlib crate which gets linked with C++ code built by CMake using [CMake's equivalent of `+whole-archive`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html#link-features): `target_link_libraries(${APP_NAME}_lib INTERFACE \"$<LINK_LIBRARY:WHOLE_ARCHIVE,${CRATE}-static>\")`\r\n  * Rust bin crate\r\n\r\nThe Rust bin crate case is still working. The Rust staticlib case fails with the confusing error about rlibs in Rust 1.69. From the [Zulip discussion](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/.2B.2F-bundle.20link.20modifier.20and.20cc), this seems to be a regression from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/105601.
