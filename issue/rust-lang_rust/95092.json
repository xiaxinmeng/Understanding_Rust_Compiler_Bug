The effect of sorting vs not sorting will need to investigated with respect to soundness of the `crate_hash`.\n\nThis issue may conflict with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/94878, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95004 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95082.\n\nI am available on Zulip for further information.\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"Robert-Cunningham\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/95092/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/95092/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
