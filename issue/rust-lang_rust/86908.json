To fix the error,\r\ncast the value to the type specified by the error message (which you may need\r\nto import from `std::os::raw`).\r\n\r\nIn this case, `c_double` has the same size as `f64` so we can use it directly:\r\n\r\n'''\r\nunsafe {\r\n    printf(::std::ptr::null(), 0f64); // ok!\r\n}\r\n'''\r\n```\r\n(replaced backticks with quotes to fix the formatting issues)\r\n\r\nThe diagnostic itself is fine and correctly suggests how to fix the error, however I think the code in question is troublesome - passing a null pointer to `printf` is undefined behavior! As a language that prides itself in avoiding UB, I find it odd that the documentation would make a mistake like that. I think that the nullptr could also be a distraction to the reader.\r\n\r\nOn further discussion, someone also pointed out that the presented signature of `printf` is wrong, because it should have an integer return type.\r\n\r\nPerhaps these issues could be fixed by replacing `printf` with a dummy function `foo` that takes variadic arguments only? In my opinion, it would make a cleaner explanation overall.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86908/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86908/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
