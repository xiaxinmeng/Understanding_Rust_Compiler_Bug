This seems like an extremely odd restriction. Is there an intention to remove it at some point? The workaround is incredibly annoying:\n\n``` rust\ntrait Foo {}\ntrait Bar {}\n\ntrait FooAndBar: Foo + Bar {}\nimpl<T> FooAndBar for T where T: Foo + Bar {}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x: Box<FooAndBar> = unimplemented!();\n}\n```\n\nThe number of these traits grows quite rapidly as you need multiple combinations of various traits. In Diesel's case, many of these will end up needing to be part of the public API which is leading to a lot of confusing and hard to discover types.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "sgrif", "id": 1529387, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif", "html_url": "https://github.com/sgrif", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/32220/reactions", "total_count": 14, "+1": 14, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/32220/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
