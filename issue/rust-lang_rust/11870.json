I think this would enable us to make a much simpler `resolve` algorithm: one pass to associate each module with the set of names it exports, and then a second pass to wire up the glob imports.  (It still doesn't necessarily know which of the type/value namespaces the imported/exported names belong to, so `resolve` still remains non-trivial, but I think that's okay.)\n\nThis is meant as an alternative more-conservative option to #11825.  In particular, Servo's use-case as [documented by jack](11825#issuecomment-33439223) should continue to function under this plan, if I'm correct in inferring that the auto-generated code-bindings are solely creating imports.\n\n(globs are feature-guarded for 1.0, so choosing a strategy here need not block the release.  But it would probably make people more comfortable knowing how drastic a change to globs we might make.)\n\n(I have been careful in my weasel wording above not to claim that all problems with globs stem from `pub use` alone, since bugs like #3352 do not even use `pub use`.  But I suspect such bugs are artifacts of an complicated implementation strategy necessitated _by_ `pub use`, and so I still think this route is worth considering.)\n\n---\n\nI will admit up front: glob imports are not a must-have feature for me; I'd be okay if #11825 landed instead of this approach.  But I do think there is value in providing a way for people who want to play with some library to snag all of the functionality it provides trivially, especially for humans who learn via play.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pnkfelix", "id": 173127, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173127?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix", "html_url": "https://github.com/pnkfelix", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pnkfelix/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11870/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11870/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
