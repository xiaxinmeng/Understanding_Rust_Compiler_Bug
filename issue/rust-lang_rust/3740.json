When doing the original design I had intended that this state would be carried in the serializer, but of course if you must write the serialization function generically that didn't work, so we ended up with `ast_encode.rs` which does some manual serialization for any type that touches `ty::t`.  At first this wasn't a lot of stuff but of course it's growing and it's annoying.\n\nOne way to solve this is to modify the `Serializable` trait as follows:\n\n```\ntrait Serializable<S: Serializer> { fn serialize(&self, s: &s); }\n```\n\nThis allows a type to implement `Serializable` only for specific serializers:\n\n```\nimpl ty::t: Serializable<RustcSerializer> { ... }\n```\n\nTo really make this work, though, it is also necessary for the `auto_serialize` code to permit generation of an impl that is specialized to a particular serializer, since any struct which contains `ty::t` values will also only work with RustcSerializer.\n\nAnother option would be to extend the `Serializable` trait with some kind of state and carry _that_ around, but I think that winds up just being more type parameters without really adding any sort of flexibility.\n\n@erickt has done preliminary work but it's hitting an ICE somewhere in the static methods implementation.  I haven't tracked down the cause.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3740/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3740/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
