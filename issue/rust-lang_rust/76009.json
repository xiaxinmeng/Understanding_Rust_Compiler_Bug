Not exporting all the symbols makes sense most of the time, but there are situations where one wants to build an executable that supports `GetProcAddress()` (EG for allowing a library with a proc macro to access dynamically generated functions that may/may not exist). It would be nice if there was a build option or similar to make executables export symbols.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76009/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76009/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
