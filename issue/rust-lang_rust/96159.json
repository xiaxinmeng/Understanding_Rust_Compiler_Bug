The variable's type is specified, but rust does not manage to infer the `foo()` call when using one of its type's method, either through `foo().bar()` or an operator (syntaxic sugar).\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n<!--\r\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\r\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.60.0 (7737e0b5c 2022-04-04)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 7737e0b5c4103216d6fd8cf941b7ab9bdbaace7c\r\ncommit-date: 2022-04-04\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.60.0\r\nLLVM version: 14.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nBacktrace not relevant.\r\n\r\nI saw some other type inference issues in the issue tracker, but none seemed quite like this one.
