It's that I'm using the [Greek Question Mark](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/037e/index.htm) instead of a semicolon, causing a parse error. And while there is an error message, it's extremely opaque.\n\nA better error message would actually print the token that is in error directly in the error message, e.g. as @niconii suggsted:\n\n```\nerror: expected one of `.`, `;`, or an operator, found unicode character U+37E `\u037e`\n```\n\nUsing the human readable U+37E over the Rust encoding thing (`\\u{37E}`) would definitely help.\n\nIn the specific case of the Greek Question Mark, it looks exactly like a semicolon, and symbols that look like other symbols are pretty common in Unicode, but perfectly enumerable. If we had a table of unicode point to actually used symbol, we could display an even better notice message:\n\n```\nerror: expected one of `.`, `;`;, or an operator, found unicode character U+37E `;`\n\nnote: Unicode character U+37E (Greek Question Mark) looks like a semicolon, but is not.\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25957/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25957/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
