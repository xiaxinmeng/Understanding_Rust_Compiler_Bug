Whereas anything defined in the crate root is essentially \"in the prelude\" by necessity, being defined elsewhere means that we have the option of deciding whether or not these macros should be exported from the prelude.\r\n\r\nIn the original Zulip thread regarding which module these macros should be defined in, there was a small amount of discussion as to whether or not these should additionally be exported from the prelude: https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/219381-t-libs/topic/namespacing.20.60asm!.60/near/233407632 . There did not seem to be a clear prevailing opinion.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I faintly recall from the most recent libs-api meeting someone mentioning that adding new macros to the prelude (or even the crate root) might be a compatibility hazard, and should only be done during an edition. I'm not sure if this is an official policy or not.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not a blocker for `asm!` stabilization, as the item can be stabilized at `arch::asm` and exported from the prelude any time in the future.", "closed_by": {"login": "Amanieu", "id": 278509, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODUwOQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/278509?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu", "html_url": "https://github.com/Amanieu", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Amanieu/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87228/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87228/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
