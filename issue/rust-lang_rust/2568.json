The reason was that I put: `#[warn(err_non_implicitly_copyable_typarams)]`\n\nat the very beginning of the file, which of course meant it applied to only the first item in the file -- which wasn't the one containing the code that triggers the warning. I'd forgotten that attributes only apply to the next item, not the whole file (or module). But I'm sure I'm not the only one who will get confused by this.\n\nI'm not sure what a good solution would be, but I thought I would report it as a potential source of confusion. Maybe when the compiler prints a lint warning or error, it could also print something like \"Printing a warning because this is the default setting for item `fn quux(...`\", or \"Printing an error because the item `class foo {...` has a `#[warn(err_no_cats_allowed)]` attribute\"?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "graydon", "id": 14097, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDk3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14097?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon", "html_url": "https://github.com/graydon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graydon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2568/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2568/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
