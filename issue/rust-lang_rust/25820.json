This could be used to debug linkage and export issues.\n\nSomething like `nm` and `ldd`.\n\nI note that `nm` does appear to partly work on a .rlib, but the output is a bit raw.\n\nWhere is the best place to start for understanding the .rlib format as it stands? Is it a good idea to build this on `rustc::metadata`?\n\nSee also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24603672/rust-library-for-inspecting-rlib-binaries\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25820/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25820/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
