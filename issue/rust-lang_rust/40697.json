The precise plan is a *bit* unclear, so I'm opening this issue to try and discuss and lay it out.\r\n\r\nObservations:\r\n\r\n- Although `ty::AssociatedItem` lives in `ty`, it has no real dependencies and is based entirely on the HIR, so it would better live in HIR.\r\n    - The existing `ImplItemRef` and `TraitItemRef` are basically specialized variants of `AssociatedItem`, though they add a `Span` and use local-ids (`ImplItemId`) rather than a `DefId`.\r\n- There is a need for a query that given a `DefId` gives you back the `AssociatedItem` (including across crates). The local-crate portion of this query seems like it could live in `hir::map` quite nicely.\r\n- Some of this setup is carefully crafted to avoid incorrect incremental dependencies and can change as we progress on the proposed red/green changes (in particular, the current query goes to some lengths to avoid reading from `Hir(X)` when computing `AssociatedItem(X)`, instead reading from the containing impl/trait; this is because we don't want to require everything that needed even basic information about `X` to have to change when `X` changes).\r\n\r\ncc @eddyb @cramertj ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40697/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40697/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
