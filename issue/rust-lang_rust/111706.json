However, it is still problematic that new segments can only have the default `rw` permissions, when a user might want one to contain executable code or read-only data.\r\nMy current solution is to use `-segprot` in a build script's link arguments, but this only works on the root crate (https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9554).\r\nHaving an attribute or other transitive method of assigning segment permissions on mach-o targets is therefore necessary for the `link_section` attribute to be usable.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/111706/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/111706/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
