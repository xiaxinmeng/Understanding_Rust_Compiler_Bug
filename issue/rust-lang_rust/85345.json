The issue is of course clear to the experienced user, but it was very confusing.  The issue is that moving a trait into a module with the same name leads to confusing compiler errors.  It's possible this could be improved by noticing the clash which is bound to lead to problems.  The full repro [2] has not been boiled down as it's simple enough and I wanted to give the context to motivate why I would have done this, however the gist is this:\r\n\r\n[1] https://twitter.com/ekuber/status/1393605930483388416\r\n[2] https://github.com/tommythorn/bp/tree/newb-struggles\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected to see this happen: telling me that what I thought was a trait was now a module\r\n\r\nInstead, this happened:\r\n```\r\n  error[E0599]: no function or associated item named `new` found for struct `Boolish::TwoBitCounter` in the current scope\r\n     --> src/main.rs:179:39\r\n      |\r\n  37  |     pub struct TwoBitCounter {\r\n      |     ------------------------ function or associated item `new` not found for this\r\n  ...\r\n  179 |         let pht = vec![TwoBitCounter::new(true); 1 << addr_bits];\r\n      |                                       ^^^ function or associated item not found in `Boolish::TwoBitCounter`\r\n      |\r\n      = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is in scope\r\n  help: the following trait is implemented but not in scope; perhaps add a `use` for it:\r\n      |\r\n  2   | use crate::Boolish::Boolish;\r\n      |\r\n ```\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nmod Boolish { // XXX\r\n    pub trait Boolish {\r\n        fn update(&mut self, taken: bool) -> &mut Self;\r\n        fn value(&self) -> bool;\r\n        fn new(b: bool) -> Self;\r\n    }\r\n...\r\n    impl Boolish for TwoBitCounter {\r\n        fn update(&mut self, taken: bool) -> &mut Self {\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n...\r\n} // XXX\r\nuse Boolish::*; // XXX\r\n...\r\n    fn new(addr_bits: usize) -> LocalBp {\r\n        let pht = vec![TwoBitCounter::new(true); 1 << addr_bits];\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the lines marked with XXXs this works perfectly.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n<!--\r\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\r\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`: \r\nrustc 1.52.1 (9bc8c42bb 2021-05-09)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 9bc8c42bb2f19e745a63f3445f1ac248fb015e53\r\ncommit-date: 2021-05-09\r\nhost: aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.52.1\r\nLLVM version: 12.0.0\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85345/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85345/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
