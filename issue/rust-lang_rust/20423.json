The idea is that whenever a `&T` (resp. `&mut T`) is coerced to a `*const T` (resp. `*const T` or `*mut T`), we should treat that as a reborrow for the enclosing temporary scope. This would ensure that the borrow checker treats the `&T` (resp. `&mut T`) as borrowed for the enclosing temporary scope. This means that users can be sure that it is safe to use `*` pointer so long as it does not outlive the enclosing temporary scope. Longer than that the rules get trickier.\n\nSome notes from IRC that pretty much say the same thing:\n\n```\n[01:27:21] <nmatsakis> aturon: huon: that reminds me, there was a (somewhat minor) change to region inference I wanted to make which would help a lot without avoiding (purely technical, I think)\n                       violations of the safe aliasing rules\n[01:27:45] <nmatsakis> right now if you do fn foo(x: *mut int) and you call it with foo(&mut something-or-other)\n[01:27:59] <nmatsakis> region-inference treats that like \"no constraint what-so-ever on the region of the &mut that is passed in\",\n[01:28:07] <nmatsakis> which means it will infer a region that ends before the call even begins,\n[01:28:15] <nmatsakis> so you are technically in violation before you even enter `foo()`\n[01:28:39] <nmatsakis> I wanted to modify the rules for coercion from &-to-* to introduce a constraint that the region at least outlives the innermost enclosing temp scope\n[01:28:54] <nmatsakis> which means basically that when a & is coerced to a *, you know that * is useful about until the end of the statement\n[01:28:59] <nmatsakis> safely usable that is\n[01:29:23] <nmatsakis> I should open an issue about that I guess\n```\n\ncc https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/19733\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20423/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20423/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
