For example, the Diesel documentation shows that there exists an `impl` for specific trait+type combination: (in this case DB=Pg, short for PostgreSQL)\n(from [Diesel documentation](http://docs.diesel.rs/diesel/types/trait.FromSqlRow.html))\n\n```\nimpl<DB> FromSqlRow<Timestamptz, DB> for DateTime<UTC> where\n    DB: Backend + HasSqlType<Timestamptz>,\n    DateTime<UTC>: FromSql<Timestamptz, DB>\n```\n\nand again:\n\n```\nimpl FromSql<Timestamptz, Pg> for DateTime<UTC>\nimpl Backend for Pg\nimpl HasSqlType<Timestamptz> for Pg\n```\n\nYet it fails on compilation:\n\n> error[E0277]: the trait bound `chrono::datetime::DateTime<chrono::offset::utc::UTC>: diesel::types::FromSqlRow<diesel::types::Timestamptz, _>` is not satisfied\n\nThe problem here is that `FromSql<Timestamptz, Pg> for DateTime<UTC>` and thus also `FromSqlRow<Timestamptz, DB> for DateTime<UTC>` are implemented only when the feature `\"chrono\"` is enabled. But the [docs of FromSql](http://docs.diesel.rs/diesel/types/trait.FromSql.html) and [FromSqlRow](http://docs.diesel.rs/diesel/types/trait.FromSqlRow.html) don't indicate this at all.\n\nThis problem is mentioned elsewhere too: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18701 (however, that issue is about the manually written doc comments on impls). Features seem to stump and baffle users.\n\nI think that Rustdoc should clearly indicate, when an impl, or a type, trait or module, for that matter, is available only when a certain feature is enabled. That would at make the features discoverable, which they currently often aren't.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/35903/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/35903/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
