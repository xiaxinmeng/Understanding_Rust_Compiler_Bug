This no longer works as `std::num::FromPrimitive` has been removed (see #24822).\n\nIt seems reasonable to say that the \"correct\" replacement is `From` impls for various integral types. It would be great if we could derive those impls. `#[derive(From)]` is perhaps a bit non-obvious as to what it's supposed to be deriving. I'd like to be able to say `#[derive(From<i32>)]`, but that's not valid syntax.\n\nGiven that, either the attribute syntax should be extended to allow for `<>` in identifiers (it should perhaps allow for any well-formed types), or a more conservative approach would be to make `#[derive(From(i32))]` work instead (which is valid syntax but aborts in the derive machinery, saying the attribute is malformed). Since the current derive approach converts `#[derive(Foo,Bar)]` into `#[derive_Foo] #[derive_Bar]` this could be accomplished by converting `#[derive(From(i32))]` into `#[derive_From(i32)]`.\n\nIdeally there'd be some way to say \"derive `From<T>` for all integral types\", since `FromPrimitive` allowed for converting from all integral types, but I'm not certain how that should work. With the more conservative approach we could just pick an identifier and say something like `#[derive(From(raw))]`, but that's not very discoverable.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24823/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24823/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
