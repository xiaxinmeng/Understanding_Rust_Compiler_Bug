As you can see, despite the Any _clearly_ containing a `&str`, `Any::get_type_id` returns a completely different `TypeId` than either `TypeId::of` or `type_id` do.\n\nWhilst one can still do downcasting with the provided API, the discrepancy is still really weird.  There doesn't appear to be anything in the documentation to explain this, either.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "DanielKeep", "id": 77238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc3MjM4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanielKeep", "html_url": "https://github.com/DanielKeep", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanielKeep/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanielKeep/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanielKeep/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanielKeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanielKeep/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanielKeep/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanielKeep/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanielKeep/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanielKeep/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18612/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18612/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
