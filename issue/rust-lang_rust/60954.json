For example:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::path::PathBuf;\r\nuse std::process::Command;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let this_file = PathBuf::from(file!()).canonicalize().unwrap();\r\n    Command::new(\"echo\").args(&this_file).status().unwrap();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that we pass a reference `&pathBuf` to `args()` -- not `arg()`. That call will break up the path into multiple parts, and send them to target command.\r\n\r\nFor example if the file is `/a/b/c/main.rs`, then `echo` will print:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n/ a b c main.rs\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is:\r\n\r\n- `Command::args()` accepts `IntoIterator<Item = AsRef<OsStr>>`.\r\n- `&'a PathBuf` implements `IntoIterator<Item = &'a OsStr>`.\r\n\r\nFrom my use, I mistyped `arg()` as `args()`. My consequence was bad: my target program was `tar`, and it started compressing whatever it could touch in the path. Luckily I discovered that and stopped it when the compressed file was just about 2+ GB.\r\n\r\nThis is not a bug. However, would you please make Cargo print a warning when it encounter such a misuse?\r\n\r\nThank you,", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60954/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60954/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
