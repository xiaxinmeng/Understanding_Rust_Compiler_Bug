In the [GCC Linker Options](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Link-Options.html), it says that this is necessary for cross-library exception handling, but for programs that don't need that, this adds an unnecessary dynamic linking to the `libgcc` DLL, which would have to be distributed with the built executable since it's not available by default on Windows.\n\nPassing `-C link-args=-static-libgcc` should make `libgcc` statically linked, but it doesn't seem to override the `-shared-libgcc` flag. While this suggests a bug or undocumented behavior with the GCC linker, `rustc` should be aware that the user wants to statically link `libgcc` and not add the `-shared-libgcc` linker flag.\n\nI'm using Mingw-builds 4.8.1 on Windows 7 (OS is 64-bit, Mingw is 32-bit) and the Rust 0.11.0 release.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15420/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15420/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
