I have my own target description and a script that downloads SDK for the device and uses that to build the corresponding std.\r\n\r\nIf I enable jemalloc, I can compile a binary (with some other hacks) and it works. But I'd like to strip the size of the binary, so I'd prefer to use the system allocator instead. When I switch to use `force_alloc_system` and `\"exe-allocation-crate\": \"alloc_system\"` in the target description, it fails to link with bunch of missing references, like `__rde_dealloc`. Grepping the sources, these come from `liballoc_jemalloc` crate. So it seems, no matter what I do, some part of jemalloc (the rust part) gets pulled in, but the C part is not compiled.\r\n\r\nExperimenting with older nightlies, the first broken version is \u2012 the compilation with system allocator works in older ones (and produces ~130kB smaller binary):\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.20.0-nightly (696412de7 2017-07-06)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 696412de7e4e119f8536686c643621115b90c775\r\ncommit-date: 2017-07-06\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.20.0-nightly\r\nLLVM version: 4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have the code in this repository: https://github.com/vorner/xcompile. There's a build script that, when run, downloads the SDK (that one is a bit largish), copies current rust sources (yes, this needs `rustup component add rust-src`), patches them a little bit (I had some problems with libunwind) and compiles it. It doesn't clean things, so I always delete the sysroot and the sources between experiments (`rm -rf ~/.xargo target rust-src`).\r\n\r\nThere are two relevant (very similar) branches, `with_jemalloc` and `with_sys_alloc`.\r\n\r\nI think this might be somewhat related to this report: #43510, but the observable effects are quite different.\r\n\r\nI noticed there's that new `#[global_allocator]` attribute, and I'll read its documentation, but the `force_alloc_system` feature is still available, so I believe it wasn't the intention to deprecate it.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43524/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43524/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
