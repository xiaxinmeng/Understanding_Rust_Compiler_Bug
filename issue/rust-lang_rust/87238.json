You have to read the source to find out that its `Ord` implementation is `derive`d, and that `None` comes before `Some` in the `enum` declaration thus `None` sorts before `Some`. I think that should be documented.\r\n\r\nThe same issue also appears to apply to `Result`.\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":null}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": {"login": "orlp", "id": 202547, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjU0Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/202547?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlp", "html_url": "https://github.com/orlp", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlp/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlp/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlp/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlp/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlp/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlp/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlp/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlp/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/orlp/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87238/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/87238/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
