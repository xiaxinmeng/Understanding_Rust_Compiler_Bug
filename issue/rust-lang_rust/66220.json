The improper_ctypes lint fires on pointer types when T is not FFI safe. However pointers have defined layout that is always FFI safe, independent of what the pointer is pointing to. It certainly seems valid to point out the pointer won't be able to be dereferenced by C. This should probably be a clippy lint though.
