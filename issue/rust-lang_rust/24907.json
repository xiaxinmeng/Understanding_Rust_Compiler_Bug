I wasn't online to look up the trait documentation so I started a partial-implementation -> compile loop to extract the required signatures from rustc, one tiny step at a time. I had to laugh when I got to the end of the process only to find:\n\n```\nsrc/main.rs:437:6: 437:23 warning: use of deprecated item: renamed to Display, #[warn(deprecated)] on by default\nsrc/main.rs:437 impl core::fmt::String for DataPos {\n                     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n```\n\n:D\nAside from that and #18760 (I first tried `&mut self` rather than `&mut core::fmt::Formatter`) the errors were quite good and informative. It might be worth having E0046 include the signatures along with the item names? But I can also see this being overwhelming on traits with many items...\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24907/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24907/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
