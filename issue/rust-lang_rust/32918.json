They are all represented by `DW_TAG_structure_type`.\n\nIn gdb I handle this by examining the type name and assume that if it starts with \"(\" then it is a tuple.  A tuple struct is detected by seeing if the first field is named \"__0\".  Neither of these methods are really very good -- they work ok with today's debuginfo but are not really in the spirit of DWARF.\n\nThis requires a DWARF addition.  In the short term it would be possible to pick an extension value in the `DW_AT` user space (this must be done carefully to avoid clashing with other known extensions).\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/32918/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/32918/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
