However, it was trying to build `library/test` and by extension `library/std` for some reason. This is odd since the UEFI targets are no_std targets according to rust platform support. The error I was getting is as follows:\r\n```shell\r\nerror[E0658]: use of unstable library feature 'restricted_std'\r\n  |\r\n  = help: add `#![feature(restricted_std)]` to the crate attributes to enable\r\n\r\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0658`.\r\nwarning: `test` (lib) generated 1 warning (1 duplicate)\r\nerror: could not compile `test` due to previous error; 1 warning emitted\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuilding for some other no_std targets such as `x86_64-unknown-none` works fine and only builds core, rustc-std-workspace-core, compiler_builtins and alloc. \r\n\r\nAfter some digging around, I found that this can be fixed by making the following changes\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/src/bootstrap/config.rs\r\n+++ b/src/bootstrap/config.rs\r\n@@ -363,7 +363,7 @@ pub struct Target {\r\n impl Target {\r\n     pub fn from_triple(triple: &str) -> Self {\r\n         let mut target: Self = Default::default();\r\n-        if triple.contains(\"-none\") || triple.contains(\"nvptx\") {\r\n+        if triple.contains(\"-none\") || triple.contains(\"nvptx\") || triple.contains(\"-uefi\") {\r\n             target.no_std = true;\r\n         }\r\n         target\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, hardcoding no_std like this doesn't seem to be a good solution. Maybe #95503 will solve this but I don't really know. So just wanted to bring this to community's attention (unless everyone is already aware of this).\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Ayush1325", "id": 22546812, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTQ2ODEy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22546812?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ayush1325", "html_url": "https://github.com/Ayush1325", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ayush1325/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ayush1325/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ayush1325/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ayush1325/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ayush1325/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ayush1325/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ayush1325/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ayush1325/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Ayush1325/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97322/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/97322/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
