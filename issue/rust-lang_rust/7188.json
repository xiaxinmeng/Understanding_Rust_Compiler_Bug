Unfortunately, this opens up rust programs to denial-of-service attacks where maliciously crafted user input can cause unexpected task failure. Two cases that exist right now are invalid UTF-8 in the args list and in the environment. The mere presence of the invalid UTF-8 will cause `os::args()` and `os::env()` to immediately raise the `str::not_utf8` condition, which is unlikely to be handled by callers of these functions.\n\nI've suggested this before on the IRC channel, but I think it's worth suggesting again, that when parsing UTF-8 we should consider simply translating the first byte of any invalid sequence into the Replacement Character (U+FFFD) instead of failing outright.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7188/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7188/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
