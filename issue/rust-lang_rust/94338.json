In particular, it does _not_ check whether the `use`'d path itself is public.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I adapt the code sample from that documentation by introducing a private module with two re-exports:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub use bar::Bar;\r\n\r\n/// bar docs\r\npub mod bar {\r\n    mod bar_impl {\r\n        /// the docs for Bar\r\n        pub trait Bar {}\r\n    }\r\n    pub use self::bar_impl::Bar;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe generated documentation behaves as though I used `#[doc(inline)]` on the top-level re-export. I can add `#[doc(no_inline)]` and it will behave correctly, showing up as a re-export of `bar::Bar`, which itself is inlined. But the default behavior ends up with two separate inlined copies of the `Bar` trait, one at `crate::Bar` and the other at `crate::bar::Bar`, and there's nothing on the inlined docs that indicates that they're the same item.\r\n\r\nYou can see this today in documentation like [bytes](https://docs.rs/bytes/1.1.0/bytes/index.html) which has `bytes::Buf` and `bytes::buf::Buf`.\r\n\r\nThere's also some broken behavior in the reverse direction, which is documented in #94336.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nRe-exports should consider the visibility of the re-exported path, not the underlying item. Also see #94336 for a discussion of what happens if the re-exported path is a private re-export of a public item.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n<!--\r\nIf you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the\r\nbug also exists in the beta or nightly versions.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`rustdoc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustdoc 1.58.1 (db9d1b20b 2022-01-20)\r\nbinary: rustdoc\r\ncommit-hash: db9d1b20bba1968c1ec1fc49616d4742c1725b4b\r\ncommit-date: 2022-01-20\r\nhost: x86_64-apple-darwin\r\nrelease: 1.58.1\r\nLLVM version: 13.0.0\r\n```\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94338/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94338/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
