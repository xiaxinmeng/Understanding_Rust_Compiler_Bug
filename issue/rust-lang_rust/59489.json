I believe having an up to date assignee more frequently would simplify triage. Also, as @pnkfelix noted:\r\n\r\n> if one steals review action, it certainly seems like one should take on the burden of assignment as well.\r\n\r\nWhile one could `r? @Centril @bors r+` and such all the time, people often forget this and it instead causes churn to do so manually.
