The method is unsafe because the caller has to guarantee that the spawned thread is explicitely joined before any referenced data is dropped.\r\nThe main use for this feature is as building block for libraries that build safe abstractions around it, such as scoped threads.\r\nCurrently such libraries have to rely on subversions of the type system/borrow checker.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55132/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 5, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55132/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
