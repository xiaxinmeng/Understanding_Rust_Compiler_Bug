As per our policy for feature gates, we should prevent the unstable flags behind -Z from being used in beta and stable releases. The rationale is the same: given an interface, users _will_ end up relying on it (_especially_ with such an innocuous name as \"-Z\" to provide no warning as to its instability), and they _will_ be peeved when it breaks.\n\nI see no downside to removing these flags from the beta and stable releases. If this causes a groundswell of demand for a certain flag in the stable release, then that is an argument to stabilize it (and by failing to remove it from the stable releases, we are denying ourselves the feedback of which flags are useful).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24971/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24971/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
