I'm fairly confident the following scenario should be allowed:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait CenterOriginRect {\r\n  fn center(&self) -> Point;\r\n  fn width(&self) -> Meters;\r\n  fn height(&self) -> Meters;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl<'a, T: CenterOriginRect> From<&'a T> for Rect {\r\n  fn from(r: &T) -> Rect {\r\n    Rect {\r\n      x: r.center().x - r.width() / 2.0,\r\n      y: r.center().y - r.height() / 2.0,\r\n      w: r.width(),\r\n      h: r.height(),\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, Rect is external to my crate, but, CenterOriginRect obviously isn't, and isn't exposed publicly either. Therefore, no one could define a conflicting implementation, but compiling results in E0210.\r\n\r\nAt minimum, the error message seems either wrong or irrelevant, but seems to me this is a scenario the compiler could allow. Is that true? \r\n\r\nThanks! Love Rust! Would be happy to contribute a fix if this is in fact legal.\r\n\r\nedit: [Link to forum post](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-allowing-generic-impls-of-external-traits-when-bounds-prevent-re-impl/7296)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/50270/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/50270/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
