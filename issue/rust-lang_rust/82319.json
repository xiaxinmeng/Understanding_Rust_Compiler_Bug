So, far, so good. However, the wrapper of my wrapper needs to do a simple const calculation before use, and my old friend, `[E0401]: can't use generic parameters from outer function` (which has always struck me as broken regarding const, especially when it relates to a generic parameter as part of a struct's impl, when it's not an outer function, but I digress), prevents this code from working:-\r\n\r\n```\r\n#![feature(stdsimd)]\r\nuse std::arch::x86_64::_mm512_extract_epi32;\r\n\r\n#[inline(always)]\r\npub unsafe fn _mm512_extract_epi32<const index: i32>(a: __m512i) -> i32\r\n{\r\n\t_mm512_cvtsi512_si32(_mm512_alignr_epi32(a, a, index))\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[inline(always)]\r\npub unsafe fn _mm512_extract_epi16<const index: i32>(a: __m512i) -> i32\r\n{\r\n\tlet shift = if (index % 2) == 0\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t0\r\n\t}\r\n\telse\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t16\r\n\t};\r\n\t\r\n       // THIS IS NOT ALLOWED and gives E0401.\r\n\tconst Epi32Index: i32 = index / 2;\r\n\t(_mm512_extract_epi32::<Epi32Index>(a) >> shift) & 0xFFFF\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've raised a related issue about const generics on the stdsimd working group issues (<https://github.com/rust-lang/stdarch/issues/1011>), but this is potentially a wider issue. Now, this may be by design, but to me as an user, it's a bug. Why? Because it's naturally the code I'd write in about 30 seconds to do what I wanted.\r\n\r\nThoughts?", "closed_by": {"login": "jonas-schievink", "id": 1786438, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY0Mzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786438?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonas-schievink", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82319/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82319/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
