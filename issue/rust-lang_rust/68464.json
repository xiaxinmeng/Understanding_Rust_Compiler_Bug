On the other hand C11/C++11 requires only\r\nthat \"failure shall be no stronger than the success\", which arguably means that\r\none can write e.g. `compare_exchange(..., Release, Acquire)` in C/C++ but not in Rust.\r\n\r\nArguably, because neither C11 standard nor C++11 standard defines what it means\r\nfor an ordering to be stronger from another. When the issue was raised in\r\n[LWG2445], the proposed and accepted resolution was to lift those restrictions\r\naltogether, leaving only requirement that \"the failure argument shall not be\r\n`memory_order_release` nor `memory_order_acq_rel`\". \r\n\r\nIt would be beneficial to remove success/failure ordering restrictions for\r\nreasons described in C++ proposal [P0418r2].\r\n\r\n[LWG2445]: https://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/issue2445\r\n[P0418r2]: http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0418r2.html\r\n\r\nEDIT: Restrictions were lifted in clang & LLVM:\r\n\r\n* https://reviews.llvm.org/rG431e3138a1f3fd2bb7b25e1f4766d935058136f8\r\n* https://reviews.llvm.org/rG819e0d105e84c6081cfcfa0e38fd257b6124553a", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/68464/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/68464/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "reopened"}
