SuperCuber on the Rust discord helped me out by suggesting I make the *field* public, which solved my problem. \r\n\r\nHowever, this error is misleading -- it suggests that the struct itself is private, not the field. There should perhaps be a clarifying note suggesting that the field(s) of the struct might need to be made public. It is worth noting that this error changes when you add a `use ::A::Foo`: [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=ff1d3f465d66970dc42904681f4b04c9&version=nightly.)\r\n## Meta\r\n\r\nAffects rust playground nightly, which I assume is using the latest version.", "closed_by": {"login": "Restioson", "id": 6688948, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODg5NDg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6688948?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Restioson", "html_url": "https://github.com/Restioson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Restioson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Restioson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Restioson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Restioson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Restioson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Restioson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Restioson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Restioson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Restioson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46407/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46407/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
