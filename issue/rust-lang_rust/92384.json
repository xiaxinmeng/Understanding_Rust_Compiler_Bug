In that\r\ncase, you can use use `issue = \"none\"` in your initial implementation PR. The\r\nreviewer will ask you to open a tracking issue if they agree your feature can be\r\nadded without an RFC.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFeature gate: `#![feature(const_result_drop)]`\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for the `const_result_drop` feature, which includes constness for the following methods:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl<T, E> Result<T, E> {\r\n    // will drop error\r\n    pub const fn ok(self) -> Option<T>\r\n    where\r\n        E: ~const Drop;\r\n\r\n    // will drop ok\r\n    pub const fn err(self) -> Option<E>\r\n    where\r\n        T: ~const Drop;\r\n\r\n    // will drop error or the argument\r\n    pub const fn and<U>(self, res: Result<U, E>) -> Result<U, E>\r\n    where\r\n        T: ~const Drop,\r\n        U: ~const Drop,\r\n        E: ~const Drop;\r\n    \r\n    // will drop ok or the argument\r\n    pub const fn or<F>(self, res: Result<T, F>) -> Result<T, F>\r\n    where\r\n        T: ~const Drop,\r\n        E: ~const Drop,\r\n        F: ~const Drop;\r\n\r\n    // will drop error or the argument\r\n    pub const fn unwrap_or(self, default: T) -> T\r\n    where\r\n        T: ~const Drop,\r\n        E: ~const Drop;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that these depend on the semantics for `~const Drop`, which is (probably) tracked in #67792.\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation: #92385\r\n- [ ] Final comment period (FCP)\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOnce the feature has gone through a few release cycles and there are no\r\nunresolved questions left, the feature might be ready for stabilization.\r\n\r\nIf this feature didn't go through the RFC process, a final comment period\r\n(FCP) is always needed before stabilization. This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library API team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncomment period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- None yet.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "clarfonthey", "id": 15850505, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODUwNTA1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15850505?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey", "html_url": "https://github.com/clarfonthey", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/92384/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/92384/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
