"Our static.rust-lang.org CNAME points to `static.rust-lang.org.s3.amazonaws.com`, but apparently if we instead use `static.rust-lang.org.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com` then index.html works correctly. cc #11897.\n\n```\n13:14 <@brson> acrichto: do you have a link to that DNS issue you were talking about this morning?\n13:14 <@acrichto> brson: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html -- kinda\n13:15 <@brson> acrichto: what is it you think we need to do?\n13:16 <@acrichto> currently there is a CNAME record for static.rust-lang.org pointing at static.rust-lang.org.s3.amazonaws.com\n13:16 < eddyb> please enable index.html if you're fiddling with aws settings\n13:17 <@brson> eddyb: can you tell me how to 'enable index.html'?\n13:17 < eddyb> I know someone explaining it somewhere, maybe a github issue\n13:18 <@acrichto> brson: we need another cname record\n13:18 < eddyb> brson: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/11897\n13:18 <@acrichto> let me figure out what it needs to be\n13:18 < eddyb> oh acrichto tried it already\n13:18 <@acrichto> brson: static.rust-lang.org.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\n13:18 <@acrichto> brson: if you take a look at that link \"/doc/master\" will render the index.html page\n13:18 <@acrichto> (as it's already configured to do)\n13:19 <@acrichto> I think that for it to work properly on static.rust-lang.org that we need to have a CNAME ourselves pointing at that host\n13:19 < eddyb> acrichto: aaah this is the same thing?\n13:19 <@acrichto> eddyb: visit that url at \"/doc/master\"\n13:19 <@brson> acrichto: do you know why the different hosts behave differentlny?\n13:19 < eddyb> haha I feel even sillier\n13:19 <@acrichto> http://static.rust-lang.org.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/doc/master/\n13:19 < eddyb> acrichto: yeah I saw it :D\n13:19 <@acrichto> we're already configured for an index.html\n13:19 <@acrichto> it's just not working\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url":
