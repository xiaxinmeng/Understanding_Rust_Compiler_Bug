These are currently the only exposed support for DNS as a public interface. Functions like `TcpStream::connect` already expose the ability to resolve names via passing a string, but this cannot be done programmatically currently.\n\nThere are a number of thorny issues to deal with here:\n- Is calling `getaddrinfo` and `getnameinfo` here appropriate?\n- What should the arguments be? Should this use a builder? \n- In the `getaddrinfo` case, should IP addresses or socket addresses be returned?\n- In the `getnameinfo` case, should IP addresses or socket addresses be taken?\n- What should the return values look like? Iterators? Structs exposing accessors? (like `DirEntry`)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27705/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27705/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
