The latter are not hyperlinks, and so are black.\r\n\r\nWe should make the Rustdoc-generated prose headings also be hyperlinks to themselves, since the heading provides a larger click target than the \u00a7. We should also decide whether we want headings to be blue or black (I have a slight preference for black). Thoughts @rust-lang/rustdoc?\r\n\r\nOne other possibility would be that we want to preserve the color distinction between author-generated headings and Rustdoc-generated headings. However, as pointed out in #59829, the more things we use colors to distinguish, the harder it is to get people's attention on distinctions that really matter.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90245/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90245/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
