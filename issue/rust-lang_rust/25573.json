An experienced C programmer will try and avoid `#define` as much as possible (they do have their use) because:\n- a `#define` is unscoped, and the C preprocessor is _just_ a text preprocessor\n- a `#define` is untyped\n\nYou can check [constants - \"static const\" vs \"define\" in C](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1674032/static-const-vs-define-in-c) for more context and relevant advices; specifically Jonathan Leffer's answer (yep, just skip mine). _Note: in C++, the answer is `static const` because C++ lifts a lot of restrictions for where one can use `static const` variables._\n\nSince in Rust `const` is scoped and typed, it is really no equivalent to `#define`. It is, however, much closer to `enum`.\n\nMaybe simply comparing to `enum` instead of `#define` would avoid confusing the reader?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25573/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25573/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
