1.57.0.\r\n\r\nThe test case is a basic one from the gdb test suite:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// Copyright (C) 2017-2022 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\n\r\n// This program is free software; you can

With 1.56.0, this passes, but with 1.57.0, this is not found.\r\n\r\nYou can test it by compiling like:\r\n```\r\n$ rustc -g traits.rs\r\n$ readelf -wi ./traits | grep DW_AT_containing\r\n```\r\n\r\nFWIW this functionality landed in `ae4cc6069626206b493caf6b1158d3d5d601bbc7`.  Looking at it now, I see that it did not include a test that checked to verify that the desired DWARF was generated.  So, it's understandable that this could regress.\r\n\r\nThis particular DWARF extension is useful when examining trait objects.  It lets a debugger find the correct type at runtime.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "michaelwoerister", "id": 1825894, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjU4OTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1825894?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister", "html_url": "https://github.com/michaelwoerister", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93164/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93164/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
