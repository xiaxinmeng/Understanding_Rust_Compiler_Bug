So I ran `./x.py test linkchecker --test-args library/alloc`, realized it was building a full rustc (`tidy` seems to overwrite that default so maybe the linkchecker should, too? that sounds like https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76371), added `--stage 0`, and still had to wait quite a bit while it built rustbook and \"unstable-book-gen\" and whatnot, none of which is needed to ensure that the liballoc docs do not have bad links. And then it still built a full rustc so I stopped, I guess I will have to rely on CI for this.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to runst linkcheker on the docs for library/alloc without building rustc?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76762/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/76762/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
