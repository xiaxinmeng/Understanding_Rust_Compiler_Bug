But the test for issue #506 needs a `fn()`, and there are no such functions left in the runtime builtins with unsupervise gone.\n\nThe hack I pulled to use `get_task_id` instead worked on all platforms but darwin, where it compiled to get the return value by reference instead of in a register.\n\nAdding a wrapper wouldn't work because the test case's intent is to call the function directly. This probably requires a snapshot.\n\nCurrently xfailed on all platforms.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bblum", "id": 1820515, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjA1MTU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1820515?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum", "html_url": "https://github.com/bblum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2957/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2957/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
