Debugging with rust-lldb suggests this is at a deliberate compiler-inserted instruction undefined instruction -`ud2`. This seems... wrong. Is an invariant being violated somewhere?\r\n\r\nA little bit more info:-\r\n* Line failing is `liballoc/rc.rs:1392:21`\r\n* Rust version is rustc 1.31.0-nightly (bef62ccdd 2018-10-16), edition 2015.\r\n* Platform is Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nCode involved in Rust seems to be `abort()`, which presumably is compiled to `ud2`, ok get that. A debug message here would be nicer... like dumping the weak count to stderr.
