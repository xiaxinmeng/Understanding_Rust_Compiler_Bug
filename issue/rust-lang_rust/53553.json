We could write them out in the closure expression/\"definition\" instead of keeping an extra map around, and we could also change the `Def::Upvar` of their uses in the body, to use an index instead of referring to each captured local's original `NodeId` / `HirId`.\r\n\r\nThis way I think we can have closure bodies completely disjoint from the bodies the closures are instantiated in, maybe even at the `HirId` level. Ideally we would change the HIR in such a way that expr/pat/etc. nodes can't reference locals/labels across `HirId` \"owners\".\r\nThat is, we have `DefId`s for \"global definitions\" and everything else (ignoring the type-level signatures/where clauses etc. for the moment) lives in bodies that can't refer to eachother.\r\n\r\ncc @nikomatsakis @michaelwoerister ", "closed_by": {"login": "eddyb", "id": 77424, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDI0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77424?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb", "html_url": "https://github.com/eddyb", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/eddyb/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53553/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53553/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
