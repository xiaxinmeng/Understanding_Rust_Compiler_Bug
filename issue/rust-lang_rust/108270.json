`core` & `std` are allowed to define functions and constants on function pointer types (like `fn()` or `for<'a> fn(&'a ()) -> bool`) and since they maybe never will, this issue is of low priority. For other primitive types like `!`, `()`, `bool` etc., inherent associated functions and constants are correctly resolved.\n\n```rust\n#![feature(rustc_attrs)]\n#![rustc_coherence_is_core]\n\nimpl fn() {\n    const X: () = ();\n}\n\nfn user() {\n    <fn()>::X; //~ ERROR no associated item named `X` found for fn pointer `fn()` in the current scope\n}\n```\n\nNote that the perma-unstable attribute `#![rustc_coherence_is_core]` is used in the reproducer which doesn't come with any language or stability guarantees. However, this issue is not about it but about the fact that `core` which uses this attribute internally and `std` (which can use `#[rustc_allow_incoherent_impl]`) would not be able to properly define associated items on those types. For the same reason, I'm not labeling this as <kbd>requires-nightly</kbd>. \n\n@rustbot label T-compiler A-resolve A-associated-items\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"fmease\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108270/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108270/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
