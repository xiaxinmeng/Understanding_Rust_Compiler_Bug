I only installed rustc yeasterday: rustc 1.38.0 (625451e37 2019-09-23) on Debian Buster. I've tried cloning a couple of game engines from github to compare - Piston, gglz, glium plus a random opengl demo program (github.com/bwasty/learn-opengl-rs).\r\n\r\nIt is taking forever to compile the example code - learn-opengl-rs took about 20 minutes. Piston can literally run all day and not finish. Gglz took about 2 hrs to compile and run 1 example: cargo run --example 02_hello_world.  Other examples take equally long.\r\n\r\nIf I change the \"Hello World\" text in the example and recompile, it again takes hours. \r\nI run htop, and I cen see that the problem is that all 4 cores are pegged at 100%. It also activates the fan and my computer heats up.\r\n\r\nOnce the app runs, it stays at 60% per all 4 cores. I am also unable to close or open any windows. I have to ctrl-c and reboot to get back to normal.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a Dell Inspiron 15 3521 - it only has a 7th gen i3 4 core, so I don't expect a lot, but I am able to use Android Studio, so its not that slow.
