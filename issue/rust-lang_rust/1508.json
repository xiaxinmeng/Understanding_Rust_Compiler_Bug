Instead of reusing the scheduler's stack to call C code, we'll want each scheduler thread to hold a cache of big stacks, give each task a pointer to a C stack, a stack of C contexts and a stack of Rust contexts.\n- When calling into C code, if the task already has a C stack it reuses it, if not it checks whether the scheduler has any C stacks and pops one, or it allocates a new one, and pushes the Rust context onto the Rust context stack.\n- &c.\n- When it pops the last Rust context it returns the C stack to the scheduler's pool.\n\nLanguage:\n- Would be really nice to be able to create functions with appropriate native signatures such that they could be called directly\n\nExtensions:\n- Any glue that might be needed could be generated via a syntax extension.\n", "closed_by":
