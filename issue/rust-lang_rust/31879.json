Instead it just prints `1`, apparently terminating at the formatting error of `Foo` but otherwise suppressing the error and returning `Ok` from `write!`.\n\n(I encountered this behavior in the wild on current 1.6 stable. The above is a minimal example that reproduces it).\n\nIf this is intended, I find it extremely surprising. For one, this would mean there is no reliable way to distinguish formatting errors (`Err` returned from `Display::fmt`) from `Display` implementations that simply return an empty string in the simple `format!(\"{}\", ...)` cases.\n\nBut if that's the intended behavior, then this probably qualifies as a documentation bug or omission, because there is no explanation what is the effect of returning `Err` from `Display:::fmt`.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31879/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31879/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
