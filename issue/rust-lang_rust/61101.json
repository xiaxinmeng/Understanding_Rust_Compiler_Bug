I am absolutely new to Rust.\r\n\r\nI have started reading the book online, and after introducing the concept of mutable and inmutable _variables_ in the chapter where the guessing game is developed, the explanation for\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nio::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)\r\n    .expect(\"Failed to read line\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nis that you need to pass to `read_line` a mutable _string_.\r\n\r\nThis is not consistent with the wording so far, I believe. We have defined what is a mutable _variable_. I interpret a string is the _value_ the variable holds, different.\r\n\r\nProbably, an experienced Rustacean is used to some abuse of language, or they know what the text means. But to a totally newcomer, the concept of mutable value is undefined at that early point in the book.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "jonas-schievink", "id": 1786438, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY0Mzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786438?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonas-schievink", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/61101/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/61101/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
