Specifically, the following used to work and now fails:\n\n``` Rust\nlet b = match true {\n    true => bytes!(\"test\"),\n    false => unreachable!()\n};\n```\n\nThe lifetime of `bytes!(\"test\")` is now limited to that branch of the match, so it doesn't live long enough to be assigned to `b`.\n\nI'm not sure if this means lifetimes need to change. The other option is that `bytes!()` needs to return a `&'static [u8]`. Unfortunately, the only way to do that right now is to make it equivalent to `{static b: &'static [u8] = &[...]; b }`, which makes it no longer usable as the value of a constant (e.g. `static foo: &'static [u8] = bytes!(\"foo\")`).\n\nI'm thinking the right solution is to make it legal for me to say `&'static [1u8]`. I can type that right now, but the `'static` lifetime seems to be wholly ignored, as I get the exact same error with the following as I do with the `bytes!()` example above:\n\n``` Rust\nlet b = match true {\n    true => &'static [1u8],\n    false => unreachable!()\n};\n```\n\nIf `&'static [1u8]` becomes a valid expression with the `'static` lifetime, then `bytes!()` could start evaluating to that and everything should work as expected. Furthermore, it would be nice (but perhaps not required) if `&[1u8]`, where all elements are compile-time constants, would implicitly be given the `'static` lifetime.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11641/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11641/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
