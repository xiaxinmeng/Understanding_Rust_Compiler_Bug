I found out that the rust implementation I am building is consuming much more memory. One of the reasons is that the rust Vector size and capacity are both usize (I used vector to save the children list in each node in the trie so it is widely used and consuming a lot of memory). The thing is that the children list can not grow to more than 256 values so it would be enough to use u8 to save the size and the capacity.\r\nI can implement such a vector myself in my project but I was wondering if you will accept a PR and add it to the standard library? If you will, I will be happy yo take :).", "closed_by": {"login": "Dylan-DPC", "id": 99973273, "node_id": "U_kgDOBfV4mQ", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99973273?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC", "html_url": "https://github.com/Dylan-DPC", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/106586/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/106586/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "not_planned"}
