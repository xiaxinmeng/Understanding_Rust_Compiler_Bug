Until this point in the Guide, all bindings are declared like `let var_name = \"some_value\";` or `let var_name: VarType;`. All of a sudden, we have `let SomeType(var_name) = instance_of_SomeType;`, and the only explanation is \"you can extract the inner integer type through a destructuring `let`\".\n\nIt's clear enough from the context what the line is doing (extracting the inner value), but I don't really get how the code works, or why the syntax looks that way, rather than `let integer_length = some_expression_involving_length;`.\n\nAlso, and perhaps this should be a separate issue, I personally feel like mentioning tuple structs is unnecessary at this point in the guide? They are brought up, and then immediately dismissed in favour of proper structs, which leaves the reader (or me, at least) wondering why they exist in the language at all... Perhaps tuple structs are only explained as a precursor to showing off newtypes (which do seem useful), but I still feel like newtypes could be explained well enough without going into tuple structs, or perhaps with just a passing mention that a newtype is a special case of a thing called a tuple struct, which will be covered later.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20471/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20471/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
