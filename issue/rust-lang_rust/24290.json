(You need to cast it to the right type so that you do not e.g. mistake `-1` for a large postiive value.)\n\n_Plus_, it turns out that we don't actually do all that much inference at all; a simple experiment like this:\n\n``` rust\nenum E {\n    A = 0,\n    B = 0xF_FFFF_FFFF,\n}\n\nfn main() { }\n```\n\nwhen run with a 32-bit target, reveals that the const-evaluator is only using `isize` for the type anyway, and will not automatically promote to `i64`.\n\nSo, after [discussing (irc)](https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust-internals/2015-04-10/?msg=36307267&page=3) the matter with @nikomatsakis I think we change things slightly so that at the language level, in terms of what the const-eval does etc, we should just use `i32`.  (Of course, if you override the choice with `#[repr(...)]`, then we will use that instead.)\n\nThis would be a breaking change for 64-bit platforms, but arguably what it is really doing is fixing a portability bug that has laid dormant for at least a little while (and perhaps a long while -- its a long story).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "aturon", "id": 709807, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTgwNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/709807?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon", "html_url": "https://github.com/aturon", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aturon/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24290/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24290/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
