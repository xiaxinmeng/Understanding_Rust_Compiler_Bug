Ideally it would generate and print the seed used (a u64 integer). This could be used to debug situations, maybe with a corresponding `--random-seed <seed>` parameter (which would imply `--random`).\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\nI had a look at the codebase and I think I identified the place where the sorting currently happens (https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/src/cargo/ops/cargo_test.rs#L67). I'd be happy to try to contribute a PR.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85440/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/85440/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
