In that issue, the return values of the tuple returned from calling pipes::init() were changes from (channel, port) to (port, channel) to better conform with other calling conventions elsewhere in the code base.  I noticed that pipes::init() also went against convention, but don't yet have the understanding of self hosting compiler issues to tackle this just yet.
