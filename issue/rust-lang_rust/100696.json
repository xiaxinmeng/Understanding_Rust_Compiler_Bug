[before then it pointed to core as well](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/commit/2567c35e8491df127657100196679e5a22f485fb#diff-f3aba0b18739fa5f2507cf1e05726db411dd7c99bf83a2302be2df7ca4761915).\r\n\r\nThis does NOT seem to occur with all panics coming from core; for example, trying to `unwrap` a `None` points to main:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    None.unwrap()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nthread 'main' panicked at 'called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value', src/main.rs:2:10\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Indexing* out of bounds of an array points to main:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse rand;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let index: usize = rand::random();
