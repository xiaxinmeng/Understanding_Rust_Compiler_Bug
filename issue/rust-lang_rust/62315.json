It's also awkward trying to support both interfaces at once (the cursor implementation would be cleaner if we didn't have to).\r\n\r\nThe main drawback to using it is that there will be extra state/branching in places where we don't need it.\r\n\r\ncc @eddyb who asked me to open this, and (along with @nikomatsakis) helped provide inspiration for `DataflowResultsCursor`\r\ncc @ecstatic-morse @pnkfelix ", "closed_by": {"login": "ecstatic-morse", "id": 29463364, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDYzMzY0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29463364?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse", "html_url": "https://github.com/ecstatic-morse", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ecstatic-morse/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62315/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62315/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
