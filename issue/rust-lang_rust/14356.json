Unfortunately we are now running into this bug because of the file \"alloc.bc.deflate\" created during the build process. I have filed a bug report about this [1], but in the meantime this bug is present in every LLDB version ever [2], so I guess we need to do something about it on our end.\n\nMy proposal would be to check if we generate a filename which triggers the bug and if yes, then just add an additional character to it (e.g. \"alloc.bc.deflate\" -> \"alloc.bc.deflate0\").\n\nIf somebody has a better idea, please let me know. Otherwise I'll implement this next week.\n\n[1] http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19826\n[2] Commit message by Chris Lattner: \"Initial checkin of lldb code from internal Apple repo.\" `:)`\ncc @alexcrichton @brson \n", "closed_by": {"login": "michaelwoerister", "id": 1825894, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjU4OTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1825894?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister", "html_url": "https://github.com/michaelwoerister", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/michaelwoerister/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/14356/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/14356/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
