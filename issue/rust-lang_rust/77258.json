However the corresponding `NonZero` variants are not. This seems like an omission: I would expect `TryFrom<NonZeroU128> for NonZeroU64`. The alternative is to convert to a `u128` first, throwing away the knowledge that the value is nonzero, then try to convert it to a `u64`, then try to convert it to a `NonZeroU64` knowing that the latter conversion cannot fail (one is then faced with the choice to either use an `unsafe` call to `new_unchecked`, or a potentially unnecessarily slow call to `new` even though you know the zero check is pointless because the value *came from* a `NonZeroU128` to start with and therefore cannot possibly be zero).\r\n\r\nI saw #72712 which is related, but I thought this was a somewhat separate issue because #72712 talks about conversions from primitives to nonzeroes of different widths, while I am interested in conversions between nonzeroes of different widths\u2014for which infallible cases already exist (e.g. `From<NonZeroU32> for NonZeroU64`), only the fallible ones are missing.\r\n\r\nA bug ticket might not be quite the right forum for this; if that is the case, my apologies.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77258/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77258/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
