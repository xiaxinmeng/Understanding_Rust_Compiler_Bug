When the Rust runtime tries to create its threads, it requests a stack size independent of the TLS size, which can lead to pthread_create() failing with EINVAL when the stack size is smaller than the TLS size. This was apparently an issue for the Go runtime as well (http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2012-06/msg00175.html).\n\nA potential workaround is to add __static_tls_size (+ possibly a guard page) to the requested stack size, but it's arguably a bug in glibc that TLS comes out of the requested stack, instead of being added to it. This solution is also admittedly not very pleasing...\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6233/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6233/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
