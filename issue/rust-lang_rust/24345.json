As result, it links always with libstdc++ from gcc-4.9, even if build with gcc-4.8, resulting a binary with wrong dependency.\n\nThe problem is mainly a packaging problem I think : the purpose is to produce a package for openbsd, and depending of the build environment, the linkage isn't done with the expected library.\n\nThe source of the problem is rustc compile with `-lstdc++`, letting the linker found the dependency (and it select the library with the higher version).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "semarie", "id": 8948701, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg5NDg3MDE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8948701?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/semarie", "html_url": "https://github.com/semarie", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/semarie/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/semarie/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/semarie/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/semarie/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/semarie/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/semarie/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/semarie/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/semarie/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/semarie/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24345/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24345/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
