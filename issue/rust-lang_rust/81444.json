And it's not smart to inline big chunks of data as key or value, because usually about half of the key-value space allocated by BTreeMap remains unused. But the limit on Windows is much lower than I expected (and before #81494 can apparently easily be ~~lifted~~ improved by using `box` instead of `Box::new` for the construction of btree nodes).", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/81444/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/81444/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
