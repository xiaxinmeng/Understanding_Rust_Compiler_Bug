At a glance, this seemed to me same as how the people in Lisp land love their parenthesis. \r\n\r\nOn the JVM side, I have used Kotlin and it's  a really expressive language as powerful as rust when you consider everything to be an expression. Semicolon were optional there, how come we could not figure a way around them here? Surely if we should enjoy fearless concurrency, we should also get to enjoy a less boilerplate-y necessity.\r\n\r\nIn this issue, I express my distaste at this syntax decision in a modern language and request semicolons to be made optional in a future release while maintaining backward compatibility. \r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "jonas-schievink", "id": 1786438, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY0Mzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786438?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonas-schievink", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonas-schievink/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88063/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88063/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
