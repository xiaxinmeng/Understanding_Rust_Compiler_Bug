I am curious if there are plans to add more ways to cast floats to integers.\r\n\r\nInteger arithmetic has explicit methods like `checked_add`, `overflowing_add`, etc. The compiler chooses appropriate operator to use instead of implicit `+` according to Debug/Release mode (or more specifically to -C overflow-checks=on|off flag).\r\n\r\nHowever `float as integer` uses exactly one version of cast to integer, saturating cast. Are there plans to add explicit `to_int_saturating`, additional `to_int_checked` and to call them in implicit `as` convertation according to `overflow-checks` flag?\r\n\r\nI would expect `as` to use `to_int_saturating` in `overflow-checks=off` and to use `to_int_checked` otherwise which would panic if the result did not fit the target type.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74499/reactions", "total_count": 7, "+1": 7, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74499/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
