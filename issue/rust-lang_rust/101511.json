What's going on is that before that merge, the linker was executed via `posix_spawnp@GLIBC_2.2.5`, and after, it's executed via `posix_spawnp@GLIBC_2.15`. The difference between the two is that the former retries executing through the shell when the execution first failed with ENOEXEC. This applies to anything the compiler or cargo would execute via `std::process::Command`. The change in `posix_spawnp` behavior in glibc comes from https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13134. It's probably for the better, but it should probably be highlighted in the release notes.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/101511/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/101511/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
