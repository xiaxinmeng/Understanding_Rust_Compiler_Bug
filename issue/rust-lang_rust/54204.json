Part of the issue in my opinion is that I'd argue that the above code is also equivalent to the below code:\r\n\r\n`// i is u8`\r\n`for i in 0..=255 {...}`\r\n\r\nI definitely understand the argument that they aren't so to be fair, if the first example can/will not be supported that's totally reasonable seeing as 256 is outside of the range of a _u8_. \r\n\r\nHowever, I do think it's reasonable for the compiler to at least bark at you about the first example considering the loop and it's contained code are essentially dead/unreachable code.\r\n\r\nMy initial proposal would be to just have the compiler at least warn you about the unreachable nature of your code from example 1. My pie in the sky ask would be that the compiler would be smart enough to handle the first example, again though, I do understand why that might not be a popular ask.", "closed_by": {"login": "estebank", "id": 1606434, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY0MzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1606434?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank", "html_url": "https://github.com/estebank", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estebank/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54204/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/54204/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
