https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/2009 opened up on a project recently but this looks to be a regression I think. This regressed between nightly-2020-02-19 and nightly-2020-02-20, and bisecting further by commit reveals https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/69271 as the culprit. I'm not sure which of the PRs in that rollup though are the culprit here.\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced by running `cargo check` from the `crates/js-sys` folder in the wasm-bindgen repository. Unfortunately this one probably isn't super easy to reproduce, so I'm hoping that someone more knowledgeable can hopefully take a look at this and have a better idea about what's going on. \r\n\r\nThere's definitely macros going on in `#[wasm_bindgen]` (the `Memory` type is synthesized by a macro), which leads me to think that https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/69211 may be the culprit?
