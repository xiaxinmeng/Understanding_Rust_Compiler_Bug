It takes place [every three weeks][cal] on [Zulip][z].\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nThe meeting begins with a **10 minute** announcement period. We then turn to more in-depth discussion of this week's topic(s).\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting, a summary is posted to the [compiler-team repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/tree/master/minutes/steering-meeting). To aid with this, people use the `:point_up:` \u261d\ufe0f emoji during the meeting to help highlight key comments that might want to be included in the summary.\r\n\r\nThe procedural stuff is more completely described here: https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/procedures/steering-meeting.md\r\n\r\n## Handy links\r\n\r\n- Between meetings, we track [potential agenda topics](https://hackmd.io/wsHwsi9zR3iq0ZF2SgEq9Q#) in a HackMd document.\r\n- [Internals thread](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/compiler-steering-meeting/8588/46) -- we post the agenda to this thread, along with summaries of the meetings.\r\n- [Meeting summaries](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/tree/master/minutes/steering-meeting) -- after each meeting, we post a summary of what happened. You can view the full meeting by going to appropriate Zulip topic.\r\n- The [compiler team calendar][cal] lists the steering meetings so you can track when they are.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58850/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/58850/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
