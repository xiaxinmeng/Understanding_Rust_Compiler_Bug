They're relatively small (<2 MB each), but they really pollute the src directory. I believe this has been happening on Windows (Windows 7 64-bit with msys MinGW), but I can't confirm whether or not it's been happening on Mac or Linux as well.\n\nI noticed today when a Dropbox I was using for a quick shared toy project said it had 500-some new files in it. Here's the count:\n\n```\njragonmiris#101 $~/Dropbox/rust_shared/manager/src: ls | grep tmp | wc -l\n     547\n```\n\nTheir names all look like `tmp6fukql`.\n\nThey don't cause any compilation errors, and you can delete them really quickly with something like rm -f tmp*, but it's really non-ideal. Sorry I don't have more info, I'm trying to reproduce the problem, but I haven't figured out how to force it to happen yet.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "UserAB1236872", "id": 3078382, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzgzODI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3078382?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/UserAB1236872", "html_url": "https://github.com/UserAB1236872", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UserAB1236872/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UserAB1236872/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UserAB1236872/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UserAB1236872/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UserAB1236872/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UserAB1236872/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UserAB1236872/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UserAB1236872/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UserAB1236872/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/23130/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/23130/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
