They also suggested duplicating the help text on the docs.rs homepage, which seems like a much bigger hammer, but maybe is worth considering.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23638587/138919223-fc8c02f6-9557-4964-91bd-a810eb38ecbc.png)\r\n\r\ncc @rust-lang/rustdoc", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90310/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/90310/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
