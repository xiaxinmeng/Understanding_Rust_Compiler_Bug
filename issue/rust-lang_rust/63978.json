I noticed that the first thing that happens is a full clone of all the git submodules (see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/bootstrap/bootstrap.py#L679-L687).\r\n\r\nCloning the whole history of all the submodules is generally of little interest to compile the current version of rust, but it has a non-negligible memory footprint. Today, the largest submodules are:\r\n- `src/llvm-project` with 696.10 MiB of history\r\n- `src/doc/rust-by-example` with 136.06 MiB of history\r\n\r\nDownloading so much data can be detrimental for several reasons:\r\n- This increases the latency of the build, especially for people with a slow downloading bandwidth.\r\n- The remote git server takes some time to compress the objects before sending them, also increasing the latency for everyone.\r\n- The history takes space on disk.\r\n\r\nI've tried to tweak the lines in the above `bootstrap.py` script to limit the depth of the submodule update. Unfortunately, using `--depth=1` doesn't work, because the submodule commit referenced here may not be the latest in the submodule repo, and apparently git cannot clone at a specific commit.\r\n\r\nHowever, I found that `--depth=20` (and `--depth=1` for `llvm-project`) was working on today's state. Overall, this reduced the overhead of submodule updates quite significantly.\r\n\r\nOf course, this isn't bullet-proof:\r\n- Until git supports cloning a repo at a specific commit, the heuristic depth of 20 may not be enough in the future.\r\n- I only tested this on a fresh clone of rust-lang/rust. Updating from an existing clone may not work.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, would it make sense to add an option (CLI flag to `./x.py` for example) that allows to manually reduce the cloning depth?", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63978/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63978/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
