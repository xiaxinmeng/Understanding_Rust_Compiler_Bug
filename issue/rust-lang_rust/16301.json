For instance, perf docs could be prefixed by `//?` or placed in an annotation like `[#perf-time(O(1) amor.)]`. The former would need further special syntax to differentiate time/space information, the latter would need some augmentation to permit extended discussion.\n\nRegardless of the form it takes, making this available to Rustdoc would allow some cool stuff like Traits including a performance table for their implementers. See Qt's [Algorithmic Complexity section](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/containers.html#algorithmic-complexity) for an example of what these tables might look like.\n\nI would also suggest we adopt the following notation conventions, or something similar:\n- O(n): Worst-case bound\n- *O(n): Amortized bound\n- ~O(n): Expected bound\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16301/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16301/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
