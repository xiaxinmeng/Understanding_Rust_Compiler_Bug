While this claim is defensible in some sense, the crate documentation could be more clear about what it means by this, for example by describing the criterion outlined by @alexcrichton in the aforementioned issue:\n\n> [...] having a few small \"very well known\" functions being unimplemented I think is fine (although they should obviously be minimized where possible).\n\nThe docs already talk about `mem{cpy,cmp,set}` and `rust_begin_unwind`, but in the meantime libcore gained a few other (intentionally) undefined symbols such as `fmod` and `fmodf` --- possibly others as well. The docs should explain those symbols too, and also explain how get around the need for them (don't use `%` on floats, link with `--gc-sections`).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29502/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29502/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
