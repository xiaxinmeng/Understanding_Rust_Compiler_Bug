Verified in local docs and officially hosted `docs.rs` docs.\r\n\r\n**Details:**\r\n\r\nI originally filed this issue in the `tokio` repo thinking it was an API doc bug on their part. Someone suggested it's a rust-doc bug, so here I am. The original issue has a fair amount of detail: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/issues/1738\r\n\r\n**Reproduction:**\r\n\r\nI haven't literally tested this yet, but I believe it's on the right track:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ cargo new docbugdemo\r\n$ cd ./docbugdemo\r\n$ echo 'tokio = \"0.2.0-alpha.6\" >> Cargo.toml\r\n$ cargo doc --open\r\n```\r\n\r\n-then search for `next` or `_::next`, and follow the top hit. On the resulting page use browser find-in-page-search for \"next\". Observe 0 hits. View the source of that module, use browser find-in-page for \"next\". Observe 0 hits.\r\n\r\n**Investigation:**\r\n\r\nI'm missing a lot of context here with both rust-doc and `tokio` API, but I wonder if some of these could be contributors to the bug:\r\n\r\n- `tokio` re-exports a lot.\r\n- Maybe `tokio` defines multiple different `_` traits or types in different modules?\r\n- Maybe the name `_` happens to confuse `rust-doc`.\r\n\r\n**Related Issues:**\r\nI searched this repo with [`label:T-rustdoc search`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AT-rustdoc+search) and scanned for duplicates/related items. I believe this bug is unique.\r\n\r\nTwo relevant results:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24305 - umbrella issue about re-exports which may encompass this bug. I know `tokio` has many re-exports but I'm not certain yet if that's an issue here.\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63435 - maybe this bug has a similar cause but slightly different conditions?", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66164/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66164/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
