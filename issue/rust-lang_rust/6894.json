Steps towards this have already been made in #6462.\n\nWhilst this is not a high priority change at the moment (understandably there are far bigger fish to fry), this is a semi-common question on the IRC and I think it's good if we have some place to redirect questions to.\n\nInstead of the current:\n\n``` rust\nReal::pi::<float>()\n```\n\nthis change would allow you to do:\n\n``` rust\nfloat::pi()\n```\n\nor\n\n``` rust\ntype T = float;\nT::pi()\n```\n\nThis could also allow for neat things like a generic `SizeOf` trait: `T::size_of()`, which is far nicer than the current `size_of::<T>()`. Or maybe there could be an `Init` trait for default initializers: `T::init()`.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "rust-highfive", "id": 7378925, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjczNzg5MjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7378925?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-highfive", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rust-highfive/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6894/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6894/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
