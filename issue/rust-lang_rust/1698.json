I'm sympathetic to this sentiment\n\nLately I have been feeling wary about the rapid addition of features to the language and think that we should be more cautious about committing to things we don't really need. One of the original mandates upon the announcement of Rust was to focus on removing features (it's in the language FAQ), and I don't think there's any way to argue that we have succeeded at that.\n\nAdmittedly, the ternary operator is a low-maintenance feature, but its removal is also low-impact.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "marijnh", "id": 144427, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQyNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144427?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh", "html_url": "https://github.com/marijnh", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marijnh/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1698/reactions", "total_count": 11, "+1": 7, "-1": 4, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1698/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
