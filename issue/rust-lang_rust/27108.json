Sure, one u8 rather than one usize is theoretically cheaper to hash; but marginally so only, marginally so. I see no good reason why they should use different techniques, and so I suggest that `str` should be changed to use the hashing technique of `[u8]`. This will prevent potential nasty surprises and bring us back closer to the blissful land of \u201cstr is just [u8] with a UTF-8 guarantee\u201d.\n\nHashes being internal matters, I do not believe this should be considered a _breaking_ change, but it would still probably be a release-notes-worthy change as it _could_ conceivably break eldritch codes.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27108/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27108/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
