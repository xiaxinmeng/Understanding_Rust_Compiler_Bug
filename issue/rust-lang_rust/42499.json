The standard error message is like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror[E0308]: mismatched types\r\n  --> src/main.rs:75:39\r\n   |\r\n75 |     for row in &conn.query(get_table, schemas.as_slice()).unwrap() {\r\n   |                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected trait postgres::types::ToSql, found struct `std::string::String`\r\n   |\r\n   = note: expected type `&[&postgres::types::ToSql]`\r\n              found type `&[&std::string::String]`\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst of all, \"expected trait\" is downright misleading, I think it should be \"expected trait object\". Secondly, it would be helpful to show a hint that says that:\r\n\r\n1) `String` implements trait `ToSql`, but this method is expecting a trait object, not any type that implements the trait.\r\n2) You can create a trait object from a value of type `&String` with `value as &postgres::types::ToSql`.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42499/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42499/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
