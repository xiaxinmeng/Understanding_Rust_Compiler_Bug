This means that if they grab something like `auto-linux-all-opt` it takes 3-4 hours to build, instead of 1-2. I think some of the recent master-linux failures are for a similar reason.\n\nIdeally only the faster slaves should get those builds, and should prioritize them over other builds. I don't know how feasible that is though.\n\n/cc @graydon \n", "closed_by": {"login": "Aatch", "id": 342416, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjQxNg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342416?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch", "html_url": "https://github.com/Aatch", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aatch/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7290/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7290/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
