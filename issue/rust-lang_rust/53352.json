In doing this, it was discovered that error patterns were not being applied to `ui` tests (#52531). [invalid-module-declaration.rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/ui/invalid-module-declaration/invalid-module-declaration.rs) is a test that regressed due to this and that regression was not noticed.\r\n\r\nThe error patterns previously on `invalid-module-declaration.rs` expected the following errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// error-pattern: cannot declare a new module at this location\r\n// error-pattern: maybe move this module\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn particular, these check for duplicate module declaration errors - which should arise as the `auxiliary` folder contains modules that have the same name as those being defined within the test code. However, these errors had not been occuring, and a lack of error pattern assertions meant this wasn't noticed.\r\n\r\nAt some point in a previous commit these did work, as evidenced by old `.stderr` files for this test. In #53196, the error pattern annotations were removed in order to get it passing so that PR could land.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53352/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53352/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
