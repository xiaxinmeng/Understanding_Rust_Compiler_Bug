This is, to my knowledge cryptographic overkill, as there is no clear distinction between a single HashMap with a seed and many HashMaps with the same seed, as long as that seed is not hardcoded (and therefore able to be attacked offline).\n\nThere is no argument to be had on minimizing the risk of a single compromise, as the SipHash security model is designed to make it impossible to compromise a single map. If our users disagree with this, we may consider exposing a constructor for RandomState that explicitly reseeds it.\n\nThis can be implemented via Once or through a Thread Local Static. Whichever is more efficient.\n\nCC @alexcrichton \n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27243/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27243/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
