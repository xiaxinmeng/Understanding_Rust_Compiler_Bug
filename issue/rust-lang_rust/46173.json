However, the DWARF was not updated to follow.\r\n\r\nFor example, for a sample type mentioned in the PR:\r\n```\r\nenum E { A(bool), B, C, D }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNightly emits this DWARF:\r\n\r\n```\r\n <2><b9>: Abbrev Number: 6 (DW_TAG_union_type)\r\n    <ba>   DW_AT_name        : (indirect string, offset: 0x8a275): E\r\n    <be>   DW_AT_byte_size   : 1\r\n    <bf>   DW_AT_alignment   : 1\r\n <3><c0>: Abbrev Number: 7 (DW_TAG_member)\r\n    <c1>   DW_AT_name        : (indirect string, offset: 0x7d): RUST$ENCODED$ENUM$0$B\r\n    <c5>   DW_AT_type        : <0xcc>\r\n    <c9>   DW_AT_alignment   : 1\r\n    <ca>   DW_AT_data_member_location: 0\r\n <3><cb>: Abbrev Number: 0\r\n <2><cc>: Abbrev Number: 8 (DW_TAG_structure_type)\r\n    <cd>   DW_AT_name        : (indirect string, offset: 0x7092a): A\r\n    <d1>   DW_AT_byte_size   : 1\r\n    <d2>   DW_AT_alignment   : 1\r\n <3><d3>: Abbrev Number: 7 (DW_TAG_member)\r\n    <d4>   DW_AT_name        : (indirect string, offset: 0x93): __0\r\n    <d8>   DW_AT_type        : <0xe0>\r\n    <dc>   DW_AT_alignment   : 1\r\n    <dd>   DW_AT_data_member_location: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is entirely missing entries for `C` and `D` (`B` is implicit in the special `RUST$ENCODED$ENUM$0$B` member name).\r\n\r\nThis is a good opportunity to remove `RUST$ENCODED$ENUM` and also `RUST$ENUM$DISR`.\r\n\r\n@eddyb pointed out one approach on irc, namely to use the existing `DW_TAG_variant_part` support in DWARF.  This will yield somewhat weird-looking output; first because the tag is only defined as a child of a structure, so the union will have to be wrapped in an artificial struct; and second because the discriminant is defined to be a reference to one of the struct's members.\r\n\r\nThis does seem likely to work, though; and since neither gdb nor lldb currently handle `DW_TAG_variant_part` at all, we probably have some leeway to do what we like.  Plan B might be something like introduce a small DWARF extension to represent the layout in a form closer to what rustc is actually doing.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately LLVM's debuginfo builder also does not seem to have a notion of discriminated unions, so step 1 will have to be an LLVM patch.", "closed_by": {"login": "tromey", "id": 1557670, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTc2NzA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1557670?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tromey", "html_url": "https://github.com/tromey", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tromey/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tromey/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tromey/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tromey/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tromey/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tromey/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tromey/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tromey/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tromey/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46173/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46173/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
