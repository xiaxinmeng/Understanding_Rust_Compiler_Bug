This tracking issue should remain open until we've done the implementation and successfully tested it with a new (unstable) style edition.\r\n\r\n### About tracking issues\r\n\r\nTracking issues are used to record the overall progress of implementation.\r\nThey are also used as hubs connecting to other relevant issues, e.g., bugs or open design questions.\r\nA tracking issue is however *not* meant for large scale discussion, questions, or bug reports about a feature.\r\nInstead, open a dedicated issue for the specific matter and add the relevant feature gate label.\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n\r\n- [ ] Open a new (nightly only) style edition 2024, and start adding style improvements to it incrementally, documenting them in the style guide\r\n- [ ] Implementation in `rustfmt`/`cargo-fmt` (both owned by t-rustfmt), specifics tracked in https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/5720\r\n- [ ] Stabilize the `rustfmt` and `cargo-fmt` options.\r\n- [ ] Stabilize the 2024 style edition\r\n\r\n[stabilization-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr\r\n[doc-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#documentation-prs\r\n\r\n### Implementation history\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a list of all the PRs that were involved in implementing the feature.\r\n-->\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/105336/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/105336/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
