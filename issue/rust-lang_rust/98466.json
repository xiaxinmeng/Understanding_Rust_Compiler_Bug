compelling sample:\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let mut _x: isize;\n    let mut _y = (_x = 2) == (_x = 2);\n    println!(\"{}\", _x = 5);\n    println!(\"{}\", _x);\n}\n```\nThis prints\n```\n5\n2\n```\nWhich is potentially surprising, since it's not immediately obvious that the `_x` in the `println` macro is acting like a named argument.\n\nIt would be useful to emit either a warning or an error so that named arguments that are used only based on position are identified to avoid causing confusion, since to a reader it looks like an assignment.\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START
