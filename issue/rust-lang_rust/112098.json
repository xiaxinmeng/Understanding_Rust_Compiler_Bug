Since the only difference between the builds is '_build-path_', by adding a '_--remap-path-prefix_' command in _src/bootstrap/builder.rs_ file fixed the issue. The '_issue-fixed.sh_' script will generate the reproducible binaries.\r\n\r\nSince this issue happens only with _vendor_ sources between different build paths in same host, it is clear that some crate is depending on local build path and generating a different assembly code.\r\nI've analyzed the _librustc_driver-***.so_ files and found the _.rustc_ section is differed. But, I couldn't figure out which crate is causing this issue. The _*.rlib & *.rmeta_ files generated during stage0/1 also showing a lot of differences and couldn't figure out which crate causing this issue.\r\n\r\nIt might be a bug in rust. What could be the reason that causing this issue when using vendor sources? Let me know is there anyway I can figure it out.\r\nThere was some similar issue here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/98185\r\n\r\nEDIT(AlbertLarsan68): Fixed the link", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/112098/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/112098/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
