It shows \"Loading search results...\" and doesn't complete, just like in the link above.\r\n\r\nThe JS console says: `TypeError: paths is undefined (main.js:95:15458)`, and in the JS debugger I see the following: It's trying to access `rawSearchIndex['byteorder'].p`, but `rawSearchIndex['byteorder']` does not have `p`. It looks like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrawSearchIndex['byteorder']: {\u2026}\r\ndoc: \"This crate provides convenience methods for encoding and decoding numbers in either [big-endian or little-endian order].\"\r\nitems: (265) [\u2026]\r\npaths: (5) [\u2026]\r\n<prototype>: {\u2026}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, for my own crate it works correctly:\r\n```\r\nrawSearchIndex['climeta']: {\u2026}\r\ndoc: \"\"\r\ni: (2184) [\u2026]\r\np: (143) [\u2026]\r\n<prototype>: {\u2026}\r\n```\r\n\r\nActually I guess there should be nothing about `byteorder` at all in the index, because I built the docs with `--no-deps`, and alas, when building without `--no-deps`, the search works!\r\n\r\nNow, I tried to build again with `--no-deps`, and it still works. Apparently it was trying to load some old index file that had an outdated format ...\r\n\r\nIt's great when a problem gets solved while writing the issue report \ud83d\ude06, but I think this issue might still serve a purpose, so I'll open it anyway, if only for others to find it. And maybe rustdoc should try harder to not load outdated index files.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63666/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63666/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
