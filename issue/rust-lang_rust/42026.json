I was surprised to find out that LLDB wouldn't find the debug symbols, even I had been sure to compile them in.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that on macOS, the debug symbols are stored in a directory that is separate from the binary. This directory has an extension `.dSYM`. (To be sure, there is also symbol table compiled in the binary, and LLDB was able to show stack traces because of this.), This `.dSYM` directory was produced in the build, but it's stored in `target/debug/deps/` instead of `target/debug/`. Therefore, debugging`target/debug/$BINARY_NAME` with LLDB caused LLDB not to find the debug symbols.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem, since it's surprising; I, and I bet that many others too, expect to be able to debug the main build artefact of a debug build. Many don't necessarily find the \"debuggable\" binary in the subdirectory.\r\n\r\nThere's a second problem too: using VS Code, I can modify the settings of the Launch debugger command. I can set the binary name that is going to be debugged. But the binary in the directory `target/debug/deps/` doesn't have a deterministic name, because of the hash appended to the name (which is of course the point there...). One could argue that being not able to set a glob filename for the debugging command is just a shortcoming of VS Code, but I think that there should also be a deterministically named debuggable binary.\r\n\r\nThe easy fix, of course, is to create a `.dSYM` directory in `target/debug/` too, corresponding to the binary there.", "closed_by": {"login": "golddranks", "id": 2675542, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzU1NDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2675542?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/golddranks", "html_url": "https://github.com/golddranks", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/golddranks/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/golddranks/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/golddranks/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/golddranks/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/golddranks/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/golddranks/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/golddranks/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/golddranks/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/golddranks/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42026/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42026/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
