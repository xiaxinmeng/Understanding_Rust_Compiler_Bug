I've been thinking recently that we may want a \"fancy suite\" which supports lots of custom-building options like mixing C/C++ with rust in various flavorful ways. Some examples of this would be:\n- Printing \"hello world\" from a rust library which is bootstrapped from C\n  - This would show a basic usage of bootstrapping the runtime externally\n- Exporting a symbol to get used from C at various locations in a library\n- Calling back and forth between C and Rust to make sure that things work out OK\n- Possibly other flavorful things with `#[no_std]` and friends (but perhaps limited support for I/O).\n\nI was thinking something along the lines of `src/test/fancy-suite/testname/Makefile` would basically be the \"run this test\" rules. Each test would be responsible for doing its own validation of output/errors/whatnot.\n\nI'm not sure if this really warrants a whole new style of testing infrastructure, but some of the use cases that'd be nice to test I don't know how to test today. Although perhaps in theory they could all be written in just a rust program in `src/test/run-pass`, but the makefiles/such will probably need defines for the rustc and friends to use.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10434/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10434/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
