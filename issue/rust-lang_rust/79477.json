The downcast variant\n**will truncate any bits that can't fit into the smaller variant**, which may be\nunexpected behavior. Changing `as`'s behavior so it does not support downcasting\nwould be a big task, and perhaps not worth it \u2013 that is out of the scope of this\nproposal. Instead, I propose to add a new method, `truncate_into()` that\nperforms the downcasting behavior such that it is clear in the code what is\nhappening.\n\nIt would likely be implemented as two traits, `TruncateFrom` and `TruncateInto`,\nakin to `TryFrom` and `TryInto`. `TruncateInto` would be implemented in terms of\n`TruncateFrom`, and `TruncateFrom` could just use `as` internally. In the\nfuture, if we change the behavior of `as`, we would probably have to convert\ninto an array first and then ignore some of the bytes.\n\nThis proposal stemmed from [discussion on Zulip] about the confusion arising\nfrom `as`'s truncating behavior.\n\n[discussion on Zulip]: https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/122651general/38142asgotchas.html\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79477/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79477/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
