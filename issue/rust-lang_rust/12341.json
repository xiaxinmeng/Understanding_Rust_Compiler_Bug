Two different syntax, make it no clarity and no consistency. Especially, the semicolon in inner-attr is most ambiguous (for newbies). They are many comments in #2569 about this.\n## The solution\n\nWe remove the inner-attributes and inner-doc-comments, and we always use outer ones everywhere. In the past, there was no place to write **crate-scope** outer-attributes and outer-doc-comments. But now, `crate` is already a keyword, we can reuse it to define crates (#12107), and place attributes and doc-comments on top of it:\n\nsrc/libstd/lib.rs:\n\n```\n/// The std library's documents, and attributes, go here\n#[crate_type=\"rlib\"]\n#[crate_id=\"std\"]\npub crate std;\n```\n\nAs a result, inner attributes and doc-comments are not required any more, we can remove them entirely. Perhaps we should keep the `//!` comment syntax, if most people like it (I do).\n", "closed_by": {"login": "emberian", "id": 704250, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDI1MA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/704250?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian", "html_url": "https://github.com/emberian", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12341/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/12341/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
