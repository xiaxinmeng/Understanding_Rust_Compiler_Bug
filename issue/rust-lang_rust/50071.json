I wanted to check whether that's true, but couldn't find any case where it's called. I went as far as reverting all my changes, and making `check_box_free_inputs` `eprintln` a message, and never saw one. Not while compiling the compiler itself, and not while compiling the testcase from #50041 (which *does* create a basic block with a termination call to `box_free`, contrary to most cases where the MIR only contains a `drop` ; and I tried adding `#[feature(nll)]` to that testcase in case that matters, to no avail)\r\n\r\nActually, full disclosure: I **did** see *two* calls... when compiling liballoc, which contains *explicit* calls to the function. (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/99d4886ead646da864cff7963f540a44acd4af05/src/liballoc/arc.rs#L581 https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/99d4886ead646da864cff7963f540a44acd4af05/src/liballoc/rc.rs#L696). And for those, `check_call_inputs` is clearly enough, since type checking actually happens before MIR.\r\n\r\nCc: @nikomatsakis ", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/50071/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/50071/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
