However, I can point to some questionable code in a previous iteration of the libstd btree code that such a check would have at least caught: prior to PR #30426, the btree node.rs code had this line:\n\n  https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/26a2f852beae15235e7d3c4c5751ffe8e9459817/src/libcollections/btree/node.rs#L305\n\nWas this a bug? Well, ... according to the invariants of `Unique` and `NonZero`, the `keys.is_null()` check should in principle be optimizable to be \"always false\", right?\n- The assignment occurs at the end of a drop method implementation, but the struct in question was marked `#[unsafe_no_drop_flag]`, and so that drop code can (and will) be run repeatedly, so that `keys.is_null()` call can well occur in a context where the data is in a \"bad state\"\n- (indeed, the whole point of the `keys.is_null()` check is to catch the null being used as a sentinel value, even though it is in fact illegal in that context.)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31217/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/31217/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
