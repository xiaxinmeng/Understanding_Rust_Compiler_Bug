Generally, the only new language features added after this milestone must be backwards compatible, or to fix soundness holes, though we do expect to have some leeway to make small incompatible fixes that have low impact on existing code bases.\r\n\r\n* Library stability - We have a system of measuring and ensuring the stability of API's, and a significant portion of the standard library is declared stable. Stable API's will not change. Large portions of the standard library need to be stable for 1.0, including primitive types, vectors, strings, option, numerics, collections, some I/O and concurrency.\r\n\r\n* User experience - The system is polished and the presentation is complete and professional. New users have a clear path to using and learning the system. This encompasses the web site, documentation, installation, and tooling.\r\n", "creator": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 376, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2013-10-10T18:48:33Z", "updated_at": "2016-08-28T23:13:24Z", "due_on": "2015-05-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2015-05-21T20:59:13Z"}, "comments": 18, "created_at": "2013-07-31T03:01:21Z", "updated_at": "2015-03-25T05:09:11Z", "closed_at": "2015-03-25T05:09:11Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "**UPDATE:**\n\nThe plan for drops, as I recall, was to prohibit \"specialized\" drops, but this never got implemented. The idea is to require that impls of `Drop` meet special criteria such that the `Self`parameter must (a) be a nominal type (struct or enum); (b) have fresh type parameters for each type parameter of the type with (c) no additional bounds beyond those declared in the type declaration. Note that we will have to permit type bounds in type declarations, as well, which is to some extent a separate issue (also required for DST).\n\nFor example, this is legal:\n\n```\nstruct Foo<T> { ... }\n\nimpl<T> Drop for Foo<T> { ... }\n```\n\nbut this is not\n\n```\nimpl<T:Send> Drop for Foo<T> { ... }\n```\n\nnor the example below.\n\n**ORIGINAL:**\n\nThe following code prints `Dropping!`. This is wrong.\n\n``` rust\nstruct Foo<T>;\n\n#[unsafe_destructor]\nimpl Drop for Foo<bool> {\n    fn drop(&self) {\n        println(\"Dropping!\")\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let _foo: Foo<()> = Foo;\n}\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8142/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8142/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
