The settings page settings are durable - they are remembered across page loads. Right now the `[+]` in the upper right is durable. That's surprising, since it looks the same as the non-durable left hand toggles, and isn't visible in the settings page. Also, it can be used via the `+` / `-` keyboard shortcuts, where it might not be as clear that someone is triggering a settings change.\r\n\r\nI think we should change the `[+]` in the upper right to be ephemeral. If someone wants to durably hide all docs (or durably show all docs), the settings page settings should accomplish that.\r\n\r\n/cc @GuillaumeGomez @jyn514 ", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84318/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84318/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
