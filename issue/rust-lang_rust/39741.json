Interestingly enough, I built it first by sending the project through SCP from my computer to the test server where I was going to compile it, but I saw that I was sending the compiled rlibs so I stopped the transmission, probably corrupting the files. When I ran `cargo build` the compiler panicked. I then ran `cargo clean` and `cargo build` worked as expected, so I can no longer reproduce the issue :/\r\n\r\n## Meta\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.15.1 (021bd294c 2017-02-08)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: 021bd294c039bd54aa5c4aa85bcdffb0d24bc892\r\ncommit-date: 2017-02-08\r\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrelease: 1.15.1\r\nLLVM version: 3.9\r\n```\r\n\r\nBacktrace:\r\nSadly I ran `cargo clean` before runing with backtrace and since then I cannot reproduce the issue.
