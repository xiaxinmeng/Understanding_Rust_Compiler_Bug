I decided that, for testing purposes, it was worth it to just make it a runtime check rather than compile time. However, I ran into another issue. For example:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nstruct X {}\r\nimpl X{\r\n    const CHECK: bool = false;\r\n    fn new()->Self {\r\n        assert!(Self::CHECK);\r\n        Self {}\r\n     }\r\n}\r\nfn main(){\r\n    let _ = X::new();\r\n    print!(\"done\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe assert won't produce an error at compile time, but it also won't produce an error at runtime (when `X::new()` is called). It gets completely compiled out, if you comment out the assert statement the exact same bytes are generated. \r\n\r\nI assume from a design perspective the expected behavior is essentially to replace the assert line with `panic!(\"...\")`. That being said if it errored (or warned) at compile time I think that would also be reasonable. \r\n\r\n### Meta\r\nThis applies to both the stable and nightly versions of `rustc`. \r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108850/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/108850/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
