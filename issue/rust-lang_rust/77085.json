I was able to push that to around 1,100 lines (PR #76906). \r\n\r\nHowever, in the process, I found that `FnCtxt` was rather long, with 13 fields in the struct and some rather long `impl`s attached. The sum total is 3,200 lines, which effectively means that the `// ignore-tidy-filelength` comment was moved from `mod.rs` to [`fn_ctxt.rs`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_typeck/src/check/fn_ctxt.rs).\r\n\r\nThe goal of this issue is to\r\n1. Make `fn_ctxt.rs` smaller, at minimum less than 3,000 lines by\r\n2. Moving some of its functionality into \"sub-structs\" that will be in separate files\r\n\r\nUnknowns to solve:\r\n - [ ] How do the 13 fields group into nice sub-structs\r\n - [ ] What to name the above mentioned sub-structs\r\n - [X] How to achieve this refactoring without changing the interface of `FnCtxt`\r\nSolution: Cannot do", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77085/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77085/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
