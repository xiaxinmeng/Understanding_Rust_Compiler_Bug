This resulted after a lot of fantastic hard work in PR #50763 which added the `unused_labels` lint.\r\n\r\nAt the time, the lint was set to `allow` by default. The consensus was that there would need to be a review and a crater run before it was changed to `warn`. Issue #50751 was closed without this happening, and this is where we stand today.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see this changed to `warn` by default.
