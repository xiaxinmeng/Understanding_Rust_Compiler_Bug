E.g., an occurrence of \"`println`\" in the tutorial would be a link to [here](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/core/io.html#function-println) (if I understand the suggestion correctly).  We could do this cross-linking for all top-level items: types, traits, functions, impls, etc.\n\nI wouldn't expect this to happen for code blocks, just for inline code.  Ideally, there would also be a way to turn it off -- both in the sense that we might want to be able to tell rustdoc not to do cross-linking on a particular run (to make the docs build faster), and in the sense that we might want to be able to specify that particular occurrences should never be cross-linked (because after a point it might hinder readability). \n\nPresumably we'd also eventually want this cross-linking within the documentation itself, too, as well as in the tutorial and manual.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6758/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/6758/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
