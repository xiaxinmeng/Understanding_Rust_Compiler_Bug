However, there are use cases where you want to start an external process, get immediate feedback on whether it started or not, and then continue (or finish), without waiting for the external process to finish at all.\r\n\r\nFor example, you might have `--help` for showing command line options, and `--manual` to show a full manual which you want to show by starting a web browser at a given URL but don't want the browser window to close when the rust app finishes straight after opening the browser. Similarly, you might have an app that produces results and has a `--show` option that tells the app to launch an app to show the results (spreadsheet, photoeditor, whatever); and again, you want the results window to hang around even though the command line app has finished.\r\n\r\nThis is probably easy on Unix; but I can't find a way to do it on Windows.", "closed_by": {"login": "mark-summerfield", "id": 1773348, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzMzNDg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1773348?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mark-summerfield", "html_url": "https://github.com/mark-summerfield", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mark-summerfield/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mark-summerfield/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mark-summerfield/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mark-summerfield/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mark-summerfield/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mark-summerfield/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mark-summerfield/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mark-summerfield/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mark-summerfield/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/50679/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/50679/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
