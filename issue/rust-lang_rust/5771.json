Like many other APIs the OpenGL API gives away integer tokens representing created objects. For example, the call glCreateProgram creates a GLuint token representing a shader program object. These tokens in the OpenGL API (and other similar APIs) are basically the same idea as pointer types. Because these tokens behave similarly to pointers I would like to wrap them in a type which has similar behaviours. For example, the glGetAttribLocation call gets a token representing an attribute, or buffer to fill with data of a shader program. I would like to wrap the token returned by glGetAttribLocation in a structure which has the same lifetime as the program token returned by glCreateProgram, but to do this I have to use an unneeded amount of pointers (to get proper lifetime guarantees.) Basically, I would like my wrapped glGetAttribLocation call to be like:\n\n```\n impl GLContext {\n  fn get_attrib_location <'r> (\n     &self,\n     program: Program <'r>,\n     name: ~str\n  ) -> Option <AttributeLocation <'r>> { /* Definition Omitted */ }\n```\n\nInstead of:\n\n```\n impl GLContext {\n  fn get_attrib_location <'r> (\n     &self,\n     program: &'r Program,\n     name: ~str\n  ) -> Option <AttributeLocation <'r>> { /* Definition Omitted */ }\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/5771/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/5771/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
