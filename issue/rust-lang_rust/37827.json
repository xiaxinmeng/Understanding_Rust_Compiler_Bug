Would be a bit more composition-friendly.\r\n\r\nAlso, don't forget to add to the prelude when stabilizing!\r\n\r\n# Original report\r\n\r\nThere's a currently-unused codepath in the Windows implementation of `std::process::Command::spawn` that can set `DETATCHED_PROCESS`:\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b1363a73ede57ae595f3a1be2bb75d308ba4f7f6/src/libstd/sys/windows/process.rs#L162\r\n\r\nIt looks like historically there was a method to set this but it got removed. Unfortunately there's currently no way to set this, and no other way to set the `CreateProcess` flags, so for a project I'm working on I basically had to reimplement `spawn` for Windows:\r\nhttps://github.com/luser/sccache2/blob/89f4b44d01084846893a64137d965ee844fe2d72/src/commands.rs#L103\r\n\r\nI think we need some way to set this, even if it's Windows-specific. There are a bunch of other flags that can be specified, so maybe a way to set arbitrary flags would be useful?\r\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684863(v=vs.85).aspx\r\n\r\nI think this would fit nicely onto a Windows equivalent of the [`std::os::unix::process::CommandExt`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/unix/process/trait.CommandExt.html) trait, maybe something like:\r\n```rust\r\ntrait CommandExt {\r\n  fn process_flags(&mut self, flags: u32) -> &mut Command\r\n}\r\n```", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37827/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37827/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
