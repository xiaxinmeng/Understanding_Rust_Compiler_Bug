I believe the expected behavior would be to pass through the error that `rustc` is producing. \n\nObviously this is being triggered by incorrect usage, however for people new to Rust (such as myself), incorrect usage is kind of the name of the game when learning a new language, and in this particular case it's super confusing as to what the cause is. I was able to find the source of the problem before sinking too much time in to it, but I assume that a lot of people might just get frustrated and give up.\n\nAs far as my environment goes, this happened on OSX 10.9, in both bash (GNU bash, version 4.2.45(2)-release (i386-apple-darwin12.2.0)), and fish (version 2.1.0). If you need any more info, let me know.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bitwalker", "id": 955793, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk1NTc5Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/955793?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitwalker", "html_url": "https://github.com/bitwalker", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitwalker/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitwalker/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitwalker/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitwalker/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitwalker/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitwalker/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitwalker/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitwalker/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bitwalker/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11655/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11655/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
