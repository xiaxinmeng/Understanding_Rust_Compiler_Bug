Indeed the way I felt it is that the first issues help you to get a grasp of how to make rustc work and have a little contact with rust as a language, but in the later issues one have to face a problem that is technically non trivial and face the peculiarities of Rust at the same time, which can be rather hard (at least that's how I felt it).\n\nAn idea could be for the more advanced users to tag medium issues as such, so that the less adavanced programmer could grow out of the easy issues. Servo sorta does that with its student projects doing a similar thing with rust could be another good idea.\n\ntldr: once you've done a few E-EASY issues its a huge gap to attack the other issue, having medium difficulty issues would help newcomers to train and be better (and thus more usefull).\n\nI'll dup this on reddit to have it read by more people, don't hesitate to close the issue if you think it's not the place to have it.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18435/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18435/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
