One thing that would be helpful is if, uint at least, had an impl something like \n\n```\nimpl of iter::base_iter<uint> for uint\n{\n    fn each(blk: fn(&&uint) -> bool)\n    {\n        let mut i = 0u;\n        while i < self\n        {\n            if (!blk(i))\n            {\n                ret;\n            }\n            i += 1u;\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn size_hint() -> option<uint>\n    {\n        option::some(self)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nEven better would be a real range type. They seem to be a nice abstraction for collections and algorithms and they would make it simpler to iterate over ranges with non-zero lower bounds.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2715/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2715/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
