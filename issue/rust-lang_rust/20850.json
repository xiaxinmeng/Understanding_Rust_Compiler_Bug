From what I can tell, there are a few \"page families\" that would need some tweaking (complete with fancy GitHub-powered checklist):\n- [x] _The Rust Programming Language_ (http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) [#21071]\n- [x] Rust Reference & Documentation (similar page styles) [#21133]\n  - (http://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html)\n  - (http://doc.rust-lang.org/index.html)\n- [x] API Docs (http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html) [#21597]\n\nFor the Rust Reference and Rust Documentation, a viewport meta tag might be all we need to make it mobile-friendly. The API Docs actually look pretty good on mobile already (the sidebar is pushed to the bottom of the page), but the page appears to load slightly zoomed-in (another viewport fix, likely).\n\nThe Book is rendered on mobile pretty much equivalently to the way it is displayed on larger displays, but it would be ideal for the content take up the full width of the screen. This leaves the sidebar to either be placed at the bottom of the page or converted into a dropdown menu of some sort.
