I'm surprised by that, because the `nonsend` variable is never used after the `.await` point, and it's not `Drop`. Some other notes:\r\n\r\n- Adding a `drop(nonsend)` call after the `let nonsend = ...` line doesn't help.\r\n- This _does_ compile if swap the two lines in `my_future`. That is, if `nonsend` is created after the `.await` point, the future is still `Send`.\r\n\r\nAre there any future plans to have the rustc look more closely at which locals do or do not need to be stored across an `.await`?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63768/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 6, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/63768/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
