This is a pain point for running Rust on systems without `pthread`/`TLS` support.\r\n\r\nI work on an OS that works on embedded devices. We have a libc (a MUSL fork), and much of the Rust standard library runs out of the box on our system. However, since we roll our own threads, we don't have `pthread` support.\r\n\r\nI've been working to get Rust running on our system, and this is an annoying issue. It isn't a big deal for `print!`, since it's trivial to roll our own, but it really matters for `panic!`. While it seems like we could just use a custom hook, we can't in practice since it involves taking a lock. When a library thread calls `panic!` we'd prefer to get an actual message, rather than a crash in our `pthread` stubs.\r\n\r\nI think a solution for this would be to add an option to `std`, similar to `force_alloc_system `? This would disable all the complex infrastructure around prints and panics, and just do the absolute simplest thing. These functions can be implemented (with very similar functionality) on systems without `pthreads`, it's just a case of exposing them in some way.", "closed_by": {"login": "dtolnay", "id": 1940490, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDA0OTA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1940490?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay", "html_url": "https://github.com/dtolnay", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dtolnay/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43633/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43633/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
