Basically, what I discovered was, that if I use `#[derive(Default)]` a generic struct creates a documentation for the derived trait.\r\n2. If I only partially implement `Default` myself (e.g. for a particular type `T`) there is no documentation about that trait generated.\r\n3. My expectation was that such a documentation would be generated.\r\n4. As mentioned by `@krdln` the problem exists only if you declare a `pub type` synonym and use that type synonym in `impl`.", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40395/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40395/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
