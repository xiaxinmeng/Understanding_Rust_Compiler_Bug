In particular, `addr_of_mut!(*ptr::null_mut())` is Undefined Behavior because it dereferences a null pointer.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the example for `Creating a pointer to uninitialized data` it shows this code:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet f1_ptr = unsafe { ptr::addr_of_mut!((*uninit.as_mut_ptr()).field) };\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that example it appears as though `expr` contains a dereference of uninitialized data, which is not normally valid. That seems in conflict with the earlier warning that \"all the usual rules\" apply.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that maybe dereferencing is allowed in `expr` as long as the pointer isn't dangling?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94473/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94473/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
