I don't see anywhere in the guide or reference that this is intentional and is possibly only supported accidentally as a side effect of the `as` syntax. \n\nLibrary writers that make use of this functionality put a burden on users requiring `extern crate \"foo-lib\" as foo_lib;` for all use and doctests that refer to crates with a hyphen have to be explicitly wrapped in `fn main` (to allow for an explicit `extern crate`) in order to properly refer to their crate.\n\nIs this specifically supported or an accident? If the latter, can this be removed? A lot of people name their projects/repos with hyphens and `cargo` will happily create a new crate with a hyphen in the name unbeknownst to a new user that this will cause extra burden. \n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18565/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18565/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
