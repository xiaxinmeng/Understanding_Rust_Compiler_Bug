Writing to the fields of moved values should be treated as a use after move.\n\nI was trying to demonstrate to a newer Rust user how it won't allow you to create cyclic structures without shared ownership constructs. I wrote this code, to create a linked list loop:\n\n``` rust\nstruct Node {\n    next: Option<Box<Node>>,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut first = Node { next: None };\n    let second = Node { next: Some(Box::new(first)) };\n    first.next = Some(Box::new(second));\n}\n```\n\nOf course, this currently compiles. This was surprising to me at first, and I modified it to examine the type to figure out what was going on:\n\n``` rust\n#[derive(Debug)]\nstruct Node {\n    next: Option<Box<Node>>,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut first = Node { next: None };\n    let second = Node { next: Some(Box::new(first)) };\n    first.next = Some(Box::new(second));\n    println!(\"{:?}\", first);\n}\n```\n\nThis didn't compile, because the println was a use after move.\n\nTo a user who doesn't already know this quirk of Rust, this sequence of events would be completely baffling. How does the println use after move when the field setting doesn't? I really think assigning fields on moved values should be a use after move.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "sfackler", "id": 1455697, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTU2OTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1455697?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler", "html_url": "https://github.com/sfackler", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sfackler/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36313/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36313/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
