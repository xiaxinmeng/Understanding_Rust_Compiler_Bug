I wasn't sure how to whittle it down even more, but it looked like this:\n\n``` rust\nmacro_rules! foo {\n    (@bar [$baz:ident]) => {\n        $baz += 1;\n    };\n    ($($args:tt)*) => {\n        {\n            let mut baz = 1;\n\n            foo!(@bar [baz]);\n        }\n    };\n}\n```\n\nand the output warning looked like:\n\n```\nwarning: value assigned to `baz` is never read, #[warn(unused_assignments)] on by default\n  --> <anon>:10:27\n   |>\n10 |>             foo!(@bar [baz]);\n   |>                           ^\n```\n\nOf particular note is that the caret is pointing to the closing square bracket, not `baz` as I would expect. Similarly, the bracket was colored yellow and not `baz`.\n\n[Playpen](https://is.gd/CB8F8K)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36550/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36550/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
