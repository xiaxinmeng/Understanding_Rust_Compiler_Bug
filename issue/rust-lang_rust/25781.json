Unfortunately, there's an ugly issue where the Windows path is only propagated to Mingw shells on first boot, making Rust upgrades a bit more difficult. If I want to use Rust in my mingw shell, I have to reboot or use vanilla cmd.\n\nFor instance, Rust is now in c:\\program files\\rust stable 1.0. (Or something similar, in any case.) Might it make more sense to instead use c:\\program files\\rust {stable,beta,nightly}? Then I can run separate toolchains if I like and switch my path accordingly, but a 1.0-1.1 upgrade won't break my path if I want to stick with stable. This moves the version information out of the path, but is it really necessary when `rustc -v` works everywhere consistently? Perhaps I might want multiple stable/beta versions installed, but in that case the advanced installer would let me choose another directory anyway. This would also help with the uninstall case--I've used Windows versions for the past 6-8 months or so and my path was littered with a whole bunch of old directories that weren't removed when I uninstalled older versions. :)\n\nThanks.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25781/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25781/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
