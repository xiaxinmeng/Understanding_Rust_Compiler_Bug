Could potentially display some performance metrics there too.\r\n\r\nI mention StatusPage.io specifically because I'm on the dev team and can probably organize a free account: Atlassian has been giving away free non-profit and open source software licenses for a long time and I think this should extend to status pages too, but I haven't looked into this officially.\r\n\r\ncc @aidanhs who I gather may have set up the current Twitter account.", "closed_by": {"login": "aidanhs", "id": 1050652, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTA2NTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1050652?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/aidanhs", "html_url": "https://github.com/aidanhs", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aidanhs/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aidanhs/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aidanhs/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aidanhs/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aidanhs/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aidanhs/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aidanhs/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aidanhs/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aidanhs/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42308/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42308/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
