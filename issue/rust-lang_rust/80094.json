In that\r\ncase, you can use use `issue = \"none\"` in your initial implementation PR. The\r\nreviewer will ask you to open a tracking issue if they agree your feature can be\r\nadded without an RFC.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFeature gate: `#![feature(array_zip)]`\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for the `zip` method on arrays.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a short description of the feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nJust like `Iterator::zip` combines two iterators into one, `[T; N]::zip()` returns a new array where every element is a tuple where the first element comes from the first array, and the second element comes from the second array. In other words, it zips two arrays together, into a single one.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet x = [1, 2, 3];\r\nlet y = [4, 5, 6];\r\nlet z = x.zip(y);\r\nassert_eq!(z, [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor most library features, it'd be useful to include a summarized version of the public API.\r\n(E.g. just the public function signatures without their doc comments or implementation.)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn zip<U>(self, rhs: [U; N]) -> [(T, U); N]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn the simplest case, this is a PR implementing the feature followed by a PR\r\nthat stabilises the feature. However it's not uncommon for the feature to be\r\nchanged before stabilization. For larger features, the implementation could be\r\nsplit up in multiple steps.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation: #79451\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n@cramertj [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79451#issuecomment-740792557)\r\n> [...] This seems like a pretty niche feature to me personally, but I can understand that there are situations when you might want it.
