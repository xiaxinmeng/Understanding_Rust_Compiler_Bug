https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/99467\r\n- [ ] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][doc-guide])\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR ([see instructions on rustc-dev-guide][stabilization-guide])\r\n\r\n[stabilization-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#stabilization-pr\r\n[doc-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/stabilization_guide.html#documentation-prs\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\nThe feature is unlikely to be implementable in the form that is specified in the RFC, i.e. by preserving relative order of `-l` and `-Clink-arg(s)` options.\r\n`-C link-arg` was usable for overriding options previously passed by the compiler for long time, so is pretty much guaranteed to be passed at the end of command line at this point.\r\n\r\nThe suggested solution (see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81490 and below) is to reuse the `-l` option for such arguments and introduce `-l link-arg=arbitrary-link-argument`, which is exactly like `-C link-arg=arbitrary-link-argument`, except that its relative order to other `-l` options is respected.\r\n\r\n### Implementation history\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/99427/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/99427/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
