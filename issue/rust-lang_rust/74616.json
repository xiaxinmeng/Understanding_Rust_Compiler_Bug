Recently, pull request https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73084 was merged, which makes progress towards resolving https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43081.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, older versions of certain procedural macro crates (such as `proc-macro-hack v0.5.15` and `js-sys v0.3.39`) cannot handle the changes in input caused by the Rust bugfix. To allow these crates to continue to compile, a backward-compatibility hack was added to adjust the input passed to `proc-macro-hack` and `js-sys` specifically.\r\n\r\nEventually, we would like to remove this backwards-compatibility hack, since the compiler should not have hard-coded exceptions for certain crates. However, removing this hack will break any crates that depend on affected versions of `proc-macro-hack` or `js-sys`.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that your crate continues to work, you'll want to ensure that your `Cargo.lock` references `proc-macro-hack` v0.5.16 or above, and `js-sys` v0.3.40 or above. This can be done by running `cargo update -p proc-macro-hack` and `cargo update -p js-sys`. If you maintain a library crate (without a `Cargo.lock`, no action is needed on your part).\r\n\r\n### Internal compiler details\r\n\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73084#issuecomment-652613950, I added a hack to change the behavior of `NtIdent`s passed to certain proc-macros. This was done by special-casing certain identifiers, and should be eventually be removed in favor of a proper solution.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to always wrap single identifiers in `None`-delimited groups, then we will need to wait until enough of the ecosystem has bumped `proc-macro-hack` and `wasm-bindgen`, to avoid breaking a large number of crates.\r\n\r\nCrater run: https://crater-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/pr-73084-1/index.html\r\nTriage: https://hackmd.io/O7icbSylRP6uVZyAQ9EDeA", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74616/reactions", "total_count": 7, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 2, "hooray": 0, "confused": 1, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 3}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/74616/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
