I notice in the case of the float modules, some calls use intrinsic's, some use cmath. I would be great to have a list of the required intrinsic's as we are bringing up Xtensa Rust support.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "MabezDev", "id": 6977289, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzcyODk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6977289?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/MabezDev", "html_url": "https://github.com/MabezDev", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MabezDev/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MabezDev/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MabezDev/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MabezDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MabezDev/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MabezDev/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MabezDev/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MabezDev/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MabezDev/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88817/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88817/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
