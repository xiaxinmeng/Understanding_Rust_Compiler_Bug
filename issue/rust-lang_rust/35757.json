Here's a couple examples from my project. First the correct spelling:\n\n```\n$ cargo test test_file\n     Running target/debug/duct-0b3d1841f083e660\n\nrunning 1 test\ntest test::test_file ... ok\n\ntest result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured\n\n   Doc-tests duct\n\nrunning 0 tests\n\ntest result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured\n```\n\nAnd misspelled, so that no tests actually run:\n\n```\n$ cargo test tast_file\n     Running target/debug/duct-0b3d1841f083e660\n\nrunning 0 tests\n\ntest result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured\n\n   Doc-tests duct\n\nrunning 0 tests\n\ntest result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured\n```\n\nYou can't see it here on GitHub, but the strongest detail in the terminal is that most of the green colored text (the ok's) is the same in both examples. Also because doc tests come after, and I have no doc tests in this project, the last three lines are also the same.\n\nI can't think of a use case where you'd want the test runner to silently do nothing. Can we make running no tests an error?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/35757/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/35757/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
