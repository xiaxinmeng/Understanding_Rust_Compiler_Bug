By simple I just mean the ability to know the name of the function and possibly the instruction pointer inside the function.\n\nSome possible use case:\n- Traces for each gc allocation (the old C++ managed box allocator did this)\n- Stack trace printing on failure\n- Less codegen bloat from failure functions that pass around file/line number. (function name isn't equivalent, but maybe sufficient?)\n\nThis is obviously a tricky thing to do, and I don't think that we should bring in libunwind for just this (it's pretty simple), but it appears that each platform has their own solution for acquiring a simple backtrace, and we can take the least common denominator of all of them:\n- [windows](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb204633%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)\n- [osx](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/backtrace.3.html)\n- [linux](http://linux.die.net/man/3/backtrace)\n\nThis would probably be a module in `std::unstable` like the way `dynamic_lib` is a module. This isn't really a high priority, but it would certainly be something nice to have!\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10128/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10128/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
