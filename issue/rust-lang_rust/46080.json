On some architectures it improves performance (e.g. my x86-64 Intel i7) and on others it degrades performance (e.g. my ARM v7 Raspberry Pi). I want to test it on as many architectures as possible and then conditionally turn it on or off.\r\n\r\nI personally don't have access to a variety of different machines to test this. Would it be possible to run my benchmarks on different architectures on Rust's testing infrastructure? The benchmark could be a single `.rs` file that prints two numbers on the screen (time in seconds to sort 10M integers with and without branchless partitioning).\r\n\r\ncc @alexcrichton ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46080/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46080/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
