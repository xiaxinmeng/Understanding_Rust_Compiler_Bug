The goal of this page is describe why this change was made and how you can fix\r\ncode that is affected by it. It also provides a place to ask questions or register a complaint if you feel the change should not be made.\r\n\r\n#### What is the warning for?\r\n\r\nThe `underscore_literal_suffix` warning is issued when you use `_` as a literal suffix. Due to the behavior of the lexer, this is limited to these two situations:\r\n\r\n- After char/string/byte/bytestring literals: `\"Foo\"_`\r\n- After float literals ending with `.`: `1._` (this kind of construction is already banned by means of #41946)\r\n\r\nThis warning can always be fixed by removing the `_` and inserting whitespaces if necessary.\r\n\r\n#### When will this warning become a hard error?\r\n                    \r\nAt the beginning of each 6-week release cycle, the Rust compiler team\r\nwill review the set of outstanding future compatibility warnings and\r\nnominate some of them for **Final Comment Period**. Toward the end of\r\nthe cycle, we will review any comments and make a final determination\r\nwhether to convert the warning into a hard error or remove it\r\nentirely.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42326/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42326/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
