For examples `libc` bindings were moved to its own crate and `std` links to it.\r\n\r\nIt worth checking if similar thing can be done for `libm` dependency. Decoupling `libm` library from `std` has advantages:\r\n - clear interface between the libraries\r\n - external `libm` will have its own release cycle independent of the Rust one. If there is a bug in `libm` crate then it can be released separately without waiting for a new Rust release.\r\n - external `libm` has more freedom over its implementation. Initially `libm` is going to be just a wrapper over system shared library. But it is be possible to create a version that statically links to openlibm and avoid dynamic linking. It would be great to see a libm version implemented fully in Rust, similar to what [math.rs](https://github.com/nagisa/math.rs) tries to achieve. And users could switch between libm implementation depending on their requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother question - do math functions like hyperbolic cosine need to be part of std at all? Would it make more sense to remove `libm` dependency from std completely and let users plug math crate manually instead?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40798/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40798/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
