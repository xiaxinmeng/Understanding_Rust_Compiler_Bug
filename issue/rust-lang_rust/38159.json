I couldn't find one, but searching for this is a bit hard.\r\n\r\nRight now, the borrow checker does not allow a borrow of a variable in the else branch if the let binding borrows the variable.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```rust\r\n  let mut m = HashMap::<i64, bool>::new();\r\n  if let Some(x) = m.get(&10) {\r\n    // do something...\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    m.insert(10, true);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `m.insert` is invalid, because the borrow checker assumes an active borrow for the hashmap.\r\n\r\nThe `Some(x)` binding is not in scope anymore, though, and there's no way to access `x`, so this should be allowed.", "closed_by": {"login": "theduke", "id": 241621, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTYyMQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/241621?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/theduke", "html_url": "https://github.com/theduke", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/theduke/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/theduke/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/theduke/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/theduke/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/theduke/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/theduke/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/theduke/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/theduke/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/theduke/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38159/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/38159/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
