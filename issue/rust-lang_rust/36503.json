Even if something like VisualRust writes a visualizer plugin thing to do this without natvis, there still needs to be a way to hook into `Debug` impls to easily get this sort of information.\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36503/reactions", "total_count": 7, "+1": 7, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36503/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
