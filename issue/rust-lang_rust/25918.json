There are two approaches we can take. The first is making a copy rather than using a reference:\n\n``` rust\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = vec![\"Hello\", \"world\"];\n\n    let y = x[0].clone();\n\n    x.push(\"foo\");\n}\n```\n\n> Rust has move semantics by default, so if we want to make a copy of some data, we call the clone() method. In this example, y is no longer a reference to the vector stored in x, but a copy of its first element, \"Hello\". Now that we don\u2019t have a reference, our push() works just fine.\n\nThe type of `x` is `Vec<&'static str>`. It's not necessary to clone anything here, because reference types are Copy. Even calling `x[0].clone()` is just copying the pointer into y, not making a copy of the string. \n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25918/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/25918/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
