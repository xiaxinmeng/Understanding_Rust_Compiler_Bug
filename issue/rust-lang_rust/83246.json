What gives?  This made me scratch my head for a few minutes.  As it turns out, in `impl dyn Foo`, `dyn Foo` is treated as short for `dyn Foo + 'static`.  The issue can be fixed by changing `impl dyn Foo` to `impl<'a> dyn Foo + 'a`.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say the current error is *bad*, exactly, but it would be nice if rustc could somehow warn the user about what's going on \u2013 either by warning on the impl itself, or by somehow attaching an explanation to the type error (though that might not be worth the complexity).", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/83246/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/83246/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
