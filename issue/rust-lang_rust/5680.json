This behaviour should only exist as an escape hatch for custom build logic. Most of the time, rustpkg should be able to infer what to build. The inference rules should be:\n- `foo/lib.rs` implies compiling `lib.rs` into a library with basename `foo`\n- `foo/main.rs` implies compiling `main.rs` into a binary called `foo`\n- `foo/test.rs` implies compiling `test.rs` into a test binary called `foo-test`\n- `foo/bench.rs` implies compiling `test.rs` into a benchmark binary called `foo-bench`\n- The presence of `pkg.rs` in the package root disables inference and does the \"custom build logic\" routine.\n- The \"standard inferred build\" routine is available as a library call within a `pkg.rs` script.\n\nA sketch of the logic for inferring these things is here:\n\nhttps://github.com/graydon/rust/blob/rustpkg/src/librustpkg/rustpkg.rc#L1143\n\nIt doesn't make any difference if these files are in the root of a package or in subdirs: the stem `foo` for a crate is taken from immediately-containing directory name in all cases.\n\nTest and benchmark binaries should not leave their build dirs; they should be run in-place by the install process. Mains should be installed to `bin` and libraries to `lib` in the corresponding install dirs.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "catamorphism", "id": 427212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzIxMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/427212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism", "html_url": "https://github.com/catamorphism", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/catamorphism/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/5680/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/5680/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
