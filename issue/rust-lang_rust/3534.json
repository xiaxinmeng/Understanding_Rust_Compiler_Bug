For such enums, we overload the `*` operator and support autoderef.  They can be declared with the rather non-obvious notation of `enum Foo = T`.\n\nWith the advent of structs, I think this special treatment has little purpose.  We could as easily write:\n\n```\nstruct Foo { repr: T }\n```\n\nand then create instances of such new types as `Foo { repr: v }`.  Accessing the representation of a newtype would simply be `foo.repr`.  It would not be possible to \"autoderef\" through a newtype'd value, but I am not sure if this is a problem---I have had problems where I introduced a newtype only to find that it was \"leaking\" out of its newtype wrapper due to implicit derefs I wasn't aware of.  \n\nAnother advantage is that currently our method lookup rules must have a special case just to accommodate newtype'd enums.  Currently we auto-deref as long as we can and then attempt auto-ref---except if one of the intermediate states is an enum, in which case we attempt auto-ref for that enum as well.  \n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3534/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/3534/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
