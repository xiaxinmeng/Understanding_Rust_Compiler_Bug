We made a standalone crate of this for use in Cranelift, however other compiler projects could make use of such a library as well, and in general it'd be good to have only one copy of this code.\r\n\r\nWhere's the best place for the code live?\r\n - Create a new repository under [the rust-lang organization](https://github.com/rust-lang/).\r\n - Use the repository that Cranelift is currently using [here](https://github.com/CraneStation/rustc_apfloat).\r\n\r\nWhat should the crate be called?\r\n - `rustc_apfloat` -- the current name. \"apfloat\" isn't very descriptive, except that it's the name of the upstream code this crate is based on. And the crate isn't specific to rustc :-).\r\n - `software_float` -- a more descriptive name, and not yet claimed on crates.io\r\n - other ideas?\r\n\r\ncc @eddyb @lachlansneff ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55993/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55993/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
