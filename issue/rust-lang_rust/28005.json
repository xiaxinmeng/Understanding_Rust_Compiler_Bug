Rustc output had pretty colors, but then today I upgraded to Git for Windows 2.5, which includes the mintty.exe replacement terminal (w/ bash shell). The terminal itself has colored text, such as on the prompt lines, but rustc/cargo no longer have color. \n\nI've searched all previous issues and support for mintty and msys, but haven't been able to solve the problem. (Tried setting the TERM variable to different combinations, setting MSYSCON, etc.) I've also read through the code for rust/libterm and the term crate. When I create a test program with the term crate, console color works fine:\n\n```\nextern crate term;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut t = term::stderr().unwrap();\n\n    t.fg(term::color::GREEN).unwrap();\n    write!(t, \"hello, \").unwrap();\n\n    t.fg(term::color::RED).unwrap();\n    writeln!(t, \"world!\").unwrap();\n\n    t.reset().unwrap();\n}\n```\n\nSo it seems the term crate is able to produce color in my environment, but I cannot figure out why rustc cannot. I'm hoping that someone can give some advice or help me debug this issue.\n\nThanks\n", "closed_by": {"login": "JoshBlake", "id": 470818, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDgxOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/470818?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshBlake", "html_url": "https://github.com/JoshBlake", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshBlake/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshBlake/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshBlake/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshBlake/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshBlake/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshBlake/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshBlake/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshBlake/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JoshBlake/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28005/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/28005/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
