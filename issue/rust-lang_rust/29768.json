These are a pain. They are hard to keep in sync, for one thing, as we transform the MIR. I now think we should instead store, for each statement, the innermost scope. This will allow us to recover the full set of scopes for debuginfo, as well as computing whether a statement is in an unsafe block or what.\n\nHowever, for borrowck, we also need to have scopes be grouped into continuous regions of the control-flow-graph, and we need to know as we exit a scope. For this purpose, the graph extents are tolerably good, or it seems useful to have a \"SCOPE-ENTRY\" and \"SCOPE-EXIT\" sort of statement. We might just do the borrowck before we do any optimization.\n\nIn a non-lexical lifetimes world, though, introducing SCOPE-ENTRY and SCOPE-EXIT statements for all regions would be horrible and a pain. So it seems better that we keep the notion of graph extents for the purposes of borrowck, and we just avoid changing the structure between computing graph extents and running borrowck -- or else we keep the graph extents up to date.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "nikomatsakis", "id": 155238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIzOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikomatsakis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikomatsakis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29768/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29768/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
