`false`.\r\n\r\nI would expect at least \u96f6/\u3007\u3001\u4e00\u3001\u4e8c\u3001\u4e09\u3001\u56db\u3001\u4e94\u3001\u516d\u3001\u4e03\u3001\u516b\u3001\u4e5d (0-9) to be recognized. As for other numeral systems, like the Arabic numerals, after 9 the number wouldn't fit into a `char` anymore and thus can't be recognized, but with Chinese numerals, beyond 0-9 there's many other numbers represented with a single character too, like for example 10: \u5341, which could still be a `char`. I'm not sure whether this should be recognized, but perhaps it should.\r\nThere is also financial numbers and many others, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_numerals#Standard_numbers> for a comprehensive list.\r\n\r\nI've been told that, the numerals _are_ covered in the [`UnicodeData.txt`](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/UnicodeData.txt) file mentioned in the docs of [`char::is_numeric`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.char.html#method.is_numeric), but they are listed in the `Lo` category which stands for Other Letter and so Rust doesn't consider them numeric, which doesn't make sense to me because clearly they are numerals and not letters. Rust should probably either recognize (some parts of) this category as numerals or the numerals should be added manually.\r\n\r\nAdding support for this would in turn also mean support for numerals of other East Asian languages, like Japanese and Hokkien.\r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n\r\n This happens on the stable 1.51.0 channel and all others.\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"inquisitivecrystal\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\n\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": {"login": "inquisitivecrystal", "id": 22333129, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzMzMTI5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22333129?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/inquisitivecrystal", "html_url": "https://github.com/inquisitivecrystal", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/inquisitivecrystal/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/inquisitivecrystal/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/inquisitivecrystal/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/inquisitivecrystal/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/inquisitivecrystal/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/inquisitivecrystal/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/inquisitivecrystal/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/inquisitivecrystal/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/inquisitivecrystal/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84056/reactions", "total_count": 8, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 8}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/84056/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "not_planned"}
