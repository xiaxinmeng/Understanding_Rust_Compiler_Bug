The suspected issue is that Rustdoc spawns asynchronous writes here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f41927f30943e4d57af62cfcedc9f07b819013e7/src/librustdoc/docfs.rs#L62-L68\r\n\r\nHowever, Rustdoc never checks that the writes are completed. We should add a mechanism that prevents the process from exiting before these write tasks are completed.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution: \r\n* Add a field `outstanding_writes: Arc<AtomicUsize>` to `DocFS`. \r\n* Increment `outstanding_writes` at the start of `DocFS::write`, and decrement at the end of the spawned Rayon task. \r\n* Add a method `DocFS::wait_for_outstanding_writes(&self)` that spin-loops until `outstanding_writes` is zero. (Alternatively: use a condition variable, and have `write` notify the condvar when `outstanding_writes` is decremented.)\r\n* Either call `wait_for_outstanding_writes` explicitly in the end of the Rustdoc process, or add it as a `Drop` implementation to `DocFS`.\r\n\r\ncc @GuillaumeGomez ", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/109060/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/109060/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
