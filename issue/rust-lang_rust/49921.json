Wrapping it in a BufReader (either as the outer or middle layer) made no real difference.\r\n\r\nSo I googled around a bit and found the recommended size was 64KB according to some random Microsoft article, so I decided to copy-paste the std::io::copy implementation and increase the buffer size. This got up to 600 MB/s at about 256KB which sounded a lot more reasonable...then it continued going upwards from there past the point of believability (unless the files were being pulled from RAM as a consequence of my repeated accesses). With a 10MB Vec, I got 228.36 GB/s \ud83d\ude43.\r\n\r\nUnrealistic values aside, has anybody checked the buffer value to make sure there isn't some huge low-hanging fruit for std::io::copy speeds?", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/49921/reactions", "total_count": 12, "+1": 8, "-1": 0, "laugh": 4, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/49921/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
