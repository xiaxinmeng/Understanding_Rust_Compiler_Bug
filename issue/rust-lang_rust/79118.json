However, most custom allocators indirectly rely on this function.\r\n\r\nThis means that allocators must be re-entrant, which is essentially impossible since re-entrancy detection requires thread-local storage, which in turn calls `AcquireSRWLockExclusive`.\r\n\r\nFor some reason I haven't been able to fathom, this does not always result in a crash, so many custom allocators which rely on TLS appear to work. However, seemingly inconsequential changes (such as changing the size of a struct) result in the program crashing with an access violation or stack overflow.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to remove this allocation and encode these strings at compile-time.", "closed_by": {"login": "m-ou-se", "id": 783247, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc4MzI0Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/783247?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se", "html_url": "https://github.com/m-ou-se", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/m-ou-se/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79118/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/79118/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
