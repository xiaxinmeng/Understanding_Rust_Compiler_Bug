The second use of unsafe is an unsafe block\n\nIt occurs in 4-5 depending on how you count:\n- unsafe fn\n- unsafe trait\n- unsafe block\n- unsafe impl\n- `#[unsafe_no_drop_flag]`\n\nIn my TURPL draft I currently state the following:\n\nTheir are several places `unsafe` can appear in Rust today, which can largely be\ngrouped into two categories:\n- There are unchecked contracts here. To declare you understand this, I require\n  you to write `unsafe` elsewhere:\n  - On functions, `unsafe` is declaring the function to be unsafe to call. Users\n    of the function must check the documentation to determine what this means,\n    and then have to write `unsafe` somewhere to identify that they're aware of\n    the danger.\n  - On trait declarations, `unsafe` is declaring that _implementing_ the trait\n    is an unsafe operation, as it has contracts that other unsafe code is free to\n    trust blindly.\n- I am declaring that I have, to the best of my knowledge, adhered to the\n  unchecked contracts:\n  - On trait implementations, `unsafe` is declaring that the contract of the\n    `unsafe` trait has been upheld.\n  - On blocks, `unsafe` is declaring any unsafety from an unsafe\n    operation to be handled, and therefore the parent function is safe.\n\nThere is also `#[unsafe_no_drop_flag]`, which is a special case that exists for\nhistorical reasons and is in the process of being phased out.
