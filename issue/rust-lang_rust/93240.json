That\u2019s looking terrible.\r\n\r\nThe location being in a place that moves horizontally is suboptimal; changing that would be an enhancement. The font size is ridiculously high (because it\u2019s part of a \u201ctitle\u201d, I guess?). I like the thing no longer being inside of the search bar like it used to be, so I\u2019m not suggesting any reverts, just more polishing work. Maybe this option could be placed e.g. still roughly next to the \u201cResults for \u2026\u201d heading, but right-justified so it doesn\u2019t move around when I change my search term, and also in a normal / more reasonable size. E.g. saying something like \u201csearch in \\[all crates\\]\u201d.\r\n\r\nBy the way, something not indicated in the picture that I just noticed: if it says \u201c\u2026 in \\[All crates\\]\u201d, I don\u2019t think the \u201cAll\u201d should be capitalized anymore.\r\n\r\nThe question of whether or not it\u2019s necessary for rustdoc to parrot my search term at all is one I don\u2019t care all that much about. If there\u2019s any benefit to keeping it, sure, keep it; I don\u2019t really care.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n(Minor note, looking back at my image, the arrows are a bit short. The text about font size is in-fact referring to the font size of the dropdown list, nothing else.)", "closed_by": {"login": "GuillaumeGomez", "id": 3050060, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTAwNjA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3050060?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez", "html_url": "https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GuillaumeGomez/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93240/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93240/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
