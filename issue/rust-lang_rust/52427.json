If this is incorrect, or has been brought up before, then I apologize.\r\n\r\nConsider the following code\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n/// Takes a number and increments it.\r\npub fn inc(mut x: usize) -> usize {\r\n    x = x + 1;\r\n    x\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow obviously this is a silly implementation of the function, but there are times when making a parameter mutable is useful. To avoid seeing it in documentation I often do the following:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn inc(x: usize) -> usize {\r\n    let mut x = x;\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be easier if the fact that the parameter is mutable is just elided in the documentation. It's an implementation detail and is of no interest to the caller.", "closed_by": {"login": "derekdreery", "id": 1392222, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTIyMjI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1392222?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekdreery", "html_url": "https://github.com/derekdreery", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekdreery/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekdreery/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekdreery/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekdreery/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekdreery/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekdreery/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekdreery/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekdreery/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekdreery/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52427/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/52427/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
