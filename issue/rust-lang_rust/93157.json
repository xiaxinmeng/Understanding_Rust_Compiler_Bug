Because while Rust copyright license allows distribution of derivative works, trademark policy might restrict this very own concession. Propousal:\r\n* Removing obnoxious clauses stating \"need for explicit permission, except non commercial-use\" on policy itself in what is related with media-guide. This would resolve derived restrictions from such a demanding policy. Given, in theory, even if somebody wants to makes minor changes, they would need to rebrand the entire compiler and build tools, so in practice nobody does (and just infringe above policy for practicallity).\r\n* Addressing the previous, in order to allow people to fork and by consequence contributing back, without the fear of infriging this overreaching policy. In other words this would also allow to study and redistibution of derivative works (not that people dont already, by infringement anyway) but so people have the ability to improve the source code and contribute/release improvements for the Rst codebase (which obviously still contain all references to Rst and abranged by its current trademark policy), without the need for users to rebrand their modified versions, allowing patching without \"explicit approval\u201d and withdrawing any fear of policy violation or infrigment. Therefore the community has doubts if Rst compiler and Cargo can be considered FOSS or not because it's ND by rebranding impracticability (except for non-commercial usage) so that is why is strictly urgent to remove such malevolent limitations.\r\n* Finalize all the details around the foundation and language independence and by consequence create a brand new policy, while still being able to efectively protect, and prevent copycats, or even malicius forks, that intend to republish sources with injected malware or any sort of related atacks to our project, but still respecting contributor freedom has explained above. A good sugestion would be for the team to look into similar policy, to what is propoused here. Implementation that adopt this kind of positions are for example what Perl and/or Python foundations have in place. Many believe such projects managed to reached a good balance between both objectives, on this very dificult balance.\r\n\r\npartialSOLUTION: all branding should be defined in one file or folder making it easy for somebody who wants to distribute modified copies to rebrand. Firefox has the same trademark policy as Rust (Mozilla Media-guide), but they at least make it relatively easy to rebrand the browser: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/branding/unofficial\r\n\r\nThanks nonetheless for the feedback, all your previous contributions for this project. And goodluck with finalizing all the foundation work. :)\r\nP.S.Sorry for any misspellings here, but english is not my native language. Will hopefull hear back from you in the future, Cheers.

Especially given recently show of position, that seams to provide a bit more openess and willingness to find a solution for this topic -> relevant answer:\r\n\"\r\nThe foundation will be reviewing the trademark policy, but it will ultimately be up to the board to decide the terms that are selected.\r\n\"", "closed_by": {"login": "Dylan-DPC", "id": 99973273, "node_id": "U_kgDOBfV4mQ", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99973273?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC", "html_url": "https://github.com/Dylan-DPC", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dylan-DPC/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93157/reactions", "total_count": 16, "+1": 14, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 2}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/93157/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "not_planned"}
