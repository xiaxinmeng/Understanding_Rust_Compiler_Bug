The `target_arch` was native (skylake).\r\n\r\nInstead, this happened: The intrinsics were not inlined, and required a function call each time. Some of the functions were just two moves and the operation, others had _ZN4core9core_arch3x868m128iExt8 in them.\r\ne.g. `_mm_or_si128` was just\r\n```\r\nvmovaps\txmm0, xmmword ptr [r8]\r\nvxorps\txmm0, xmm0, xmmword ptr [rdx]\r\nvmovaps\txmmword ptr [rcx], xmm0\r\nret\r\n```\r\nbut `_mm_sub_epi64` was more complex. Both intrinsics should have been inlined.\r\n\r\n### Version it worked on\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nProvide the most recent version this worked on, for example:\r\n\r\nIt most recently worked on: \r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt most recently worked on: rustc 1.50\r\n\r\n### Version with regression\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nProvide the version you are using that has the regression.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`rustc --version --verbose`:\r\n```\r\nrustc 1.52.0-nightly (d6eaea1c8 2021-03-14)\r\nbinary: rustc\r\ncommit-hash: d6eaea1c8860adb5302d2fbaad409e36585ab217\r\ncommit-date: 2021-03-14\r\nhost: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\r\nrelease: 1.52.0-nightly\r\nLLVM version: 12.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf you know when this regression occurred, please add a line like below, replacing `{channel}` with one of stable, beta, or nightly.\r\n\r\n@rustbot modify labels: +regression-from-stable-to-nightly -regression-untriaged\r\n-->\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "human-0", "id": 33237916, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjM3OTE2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33237916?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/human-0", "html_url": "https://github.com/human-0", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/human-0/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/human-0/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/human-0/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/human-0/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/human-0/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/human-0/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/human-0/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/human-0/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/human-0/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/83137/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/83137/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
