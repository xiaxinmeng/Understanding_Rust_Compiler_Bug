But I'll just leave this example I found while working on the `iter-trait` crate:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrait Map {\r\n    type Key;\r\n    type Value;\r\n}\r\nimpl<K, V, C: IntoIterator<Item = (K, V)>> Map for C {\r\n    type Key = K;\r\n    type Value = V;\r\n}\r\nimpl<T> Map for Vec<T> {\r\n    type Key = usize;\r\n    type Value = T;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should succeed, because the compiler can statically know that `Vec` does not match the given blanket implementation. But it doesn't, claiming that the two impls conflict.\r\n\r\n*Technically* this can be solved by specialisation, but that isn't stable and won't be for a while. Also, the current implementation of specialisation doesn't handle these sorts of cases yet.\r\n\r\nPlayground link: https://is.gd/VUIdw9", "closed_by": {"login": "clarfonthey", "id": 15850505, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODUwNTA1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15850505?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey", "html_url": "https://github.com/clarfonthey", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clarfonthey/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43103/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/43103/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
