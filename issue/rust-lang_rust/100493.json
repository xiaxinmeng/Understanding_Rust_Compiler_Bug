Namely, the docs now require immutability for the whole lifetime of `'a`, instead of just while it's borrowed. See also [this discussion on urlo](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/is-this-technically-sound/79783). This is relevant to our crate, `ltptr`, which provides bound lifetimes for raw pointers and uses those in conversions: https://docs.rs/ltptr/0.1.4/ltptr/trait.FromLtPtr.html", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100493/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/100493/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
