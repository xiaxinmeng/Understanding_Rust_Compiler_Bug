Is there a reason why the panic message is not:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthread 'main' panicked at 'still to do', ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nor a different panic message that's without a doubt not related to the `unimplemented` macro? (for consistency with how much the docs stress the difference between them)\r\n\r\nFor reference, [here's the paragraph](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/macro.unimplemented.html) for the difference between `unimplemented!` and `todo!`:\r\n\r\n> The difference between [unimplemented!](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/macro.unimplemented.html) and todo! is that while todo! conveys an intent of implementing the functionality later and the message is \u201cnot yet implemented\u201d, unimplemented! makes no such claims. Its message is \u201cnot implemented\u201d. Also some IDEs will mark todo!s.\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/96131/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/96131/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
