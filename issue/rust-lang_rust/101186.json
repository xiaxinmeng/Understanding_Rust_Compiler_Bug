I found this absolutely useless diagnostic though: https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=b80473c86172959763c139535154c3f9\r\n\r\nDid some more thinking and I'm wondering now if the `did.is_local()` check should actually be `infcx.opaque_type_origin(did).is_some()` so we only generate those generalized inference vars if we're actually able to handle the opaque type. I was kinda hoping to keep that isolated in `handle_opaque_type`, but that appears to have been a misplaced hope.\r\n\r\nOne more thing is that we're using `eq` inside `handle_opaque_types` when it should probably be using the relation that is calling `handle_opaque_types`. So maybe we could scrap the entire generalization logic and just always invoke `handle_opaque_types` by passing the relation as an argument and forwarding to that instead of using `eq`.\r\n\r\nso many possibilities to try out. Let's merge this PR for now and I'm moving this comment to an issue so we can continue there.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @oli-obk in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/99928#discussion_r958095248_", "closed_by": {"login": "oli-obk", "id": 332036, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjAzNg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332036?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk", "html_url": "https://github.com/oli-obk", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oli-obk/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/101186/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/101186/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
