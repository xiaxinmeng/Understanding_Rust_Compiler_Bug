I have heard of this happening today in IRC to somebody using the 0.8 Windows installer but I have found that my build from 1434b4bfcafe90cffa6627e3be18a9e5b6501ad1 is fine while my build from 6828d2e01860593a687f36397eb38dc338f092a9 causes the issue. I have previously had this same error when rustc was not in a folder named `bin` but the cause seems to be something different this time.\n\nI would be happy to assist with testing things on my system tomorrow if that helps.
