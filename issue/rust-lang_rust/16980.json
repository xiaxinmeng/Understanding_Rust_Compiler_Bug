In this case the target is the usual `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, and `rustc` is built in the usual way for the platform.\n\nIt also seems useful for writing C libraries in Rust.  We won't necessarily have `__morestack` available, and people who are already using C are more likely to want to compromise on this particular facet of memory safety.\n\nThis is a pretty big pain point\u00a0\u2014 I'm currently running `sed` on the LLVM IR to fix it! There may be a more involved solution but the original PR was closed months ago and I'd like to have the simple fix ASAP.  If people are okay with `-C no-split-stack`, I could revive the code from the PR.  Or we could make it something like `--unsafe-codegen-options no-split-stack`.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "kmcallister", "id": 444997, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDk5Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/444997?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister", "html_url": "https://github.com/kmcallister", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kmcallister/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16980/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/16980/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
