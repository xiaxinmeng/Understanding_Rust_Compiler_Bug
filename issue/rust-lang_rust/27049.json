So in the above example, it\u2019s not so much that the value at x is changing, but that the binding changed from one i32 to another.\n\nThe issues I see here are:\n- In the example being discussed, there are no pointers, so \"points to\" seems to come out of nowhere.\n- Using the phrase \"the value at x\" to refer to a variable's value again suggests there's some indirection going on, but we're just assigning to a variable. There's nothing subtle here at all.\n- The second sentence feels like a distinction without a difference.\n\nLater:\n\n> However, when we say something is \u2018immutable\u2019 in Rust, that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not able to be changed: We mean something has \u2018exterior mutability\u2019.\n\nIs that a typo? Or is saying something is immutable really saying it has exterior _mutability_?\n\nThe term 'exterior mutability' is never mentioned again.\n\nI don't have concrete suggestions (like a pull request) because I'm worried I just don't get what we're going for here.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27049/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/27049/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
