This is really hard because of all the \"Example\"s written in bigger letters catching the eye. A little picture for those who don't want to try:\n\n![rust_api_doc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7430871/4249184/5d1b3588-3a72-11e4-91f2-d4a2423d0166.png)\n\nIn comparison, try to find `math.sqrt()`  in the [Python math documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) by just scrolling the page. To me, this seems easier because of the clear highlighting of the function names and the indentation of the explanations. (Don't get me wrong, the python documentation isn't perfect, too)\n\n![python_api_doc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7430871/4249183/5d183f9a-3a72-11e4-8d4c-86df4728c0b2.png)\n\nThis issue is not really big, but programmers are humans and they're often in a hurry. A clearer structure/design of the API documentation would improve readability and help people looking for specific features without knowing the precise function name in Rust.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/17193/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/17193/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
