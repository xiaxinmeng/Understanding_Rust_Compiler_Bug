In the first, each implementation of the trait can be expanded to view its documentation. In the second, it is not possible to do this. Instead, in order to find documentation that _may_ be present on the implementation, one must:\r\n\r\n1. Find some name of an implementing type among all the text and punctuation of the relevant line.\r\n2. Click on it.\r\n3. Scroll down past all of the type documentation, scanning to locate the same trait implementation again.\r\n4. If preference \"Auto-hide trait implementation documentation\" is set, click to expand the documentation.\r\n\r\nAfter I asked about this behavior in chat, @jsha proposed that the following changes could fix this:\r\n\r\n> - On a trait page, under \"Implementors\", there should be a link that takes you straight to the implementation of that specific trait on the type page, so you don't have to scroll a lot.\r\n> - On a trait page, under \"Implementors\", there should be an indicator on each implementor as to whether you will find implementor-specific documentation when you click through (so you can skip clicking on things that will be boring)\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think that these are both good but not quite sufficient to restore all previous utility, and that it is possible to improve on the 1.55 behavior *and* the 1.54 behavior,\u00a0by **making the implementors toggleable if and only if they have documentation.** That way, the toggle buttons can double as the \"indicator \u2026 as to whether you will find implementor-specific documentation\", keeping visual/structural clutter low, and yet the trait page contains all relevant documentation (allowing it to be scanned or searched).\r\n\r\n@rustbot modify labels: +T-rustdoc ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/89874/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/89874/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
