This isn't a huge deal when the error represents an actual error case, however I/O \"errors\" are used often to signal termination in hot paths and the allocation can cause significant bottleneck.\n\nOne example is with non-blocking I/O, `io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock` is used to signal that the source is not read to process the op. Suffering an allocation for this very common case is not acceptable.\n\nTo work around this, Mio provide a helper to construct a `WouldBlock` error without the allocation: https://github.com/carllerche/mio/blob/master/src/io.rs#L40-L49.\n\nHowever, `WouldBlock` is not the only case. Another common case that I am hitting is using `io::ErrorKind::WriteZero` being triggered when calling `write_all` to `io::Write` implementations that are backed by memory (vs. an I/O type).\n\nIn general, there should be a way to construct I/O errors without allocating.\n\n/cc @alexcrichton \n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36658/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/36658/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
