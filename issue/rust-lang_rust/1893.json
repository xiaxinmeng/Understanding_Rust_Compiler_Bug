of `export` lists, we could have exports on individual items.\n\nSo, instead of:\n\n```\nfn foo() { ... }\nexport foo;\n```\n\nWe would have:\n\n```\npub fn foo() { ... }\n```\n\nAnd instead of:\n\n```\nimport foo::bar;\nexport bar;\n```\n\nWe would have:\n\n```\npub import foo::bar;\n```\n\n(Here I changed `export` to `pub` to better match classes and to avoid exceeding the 5-character limit, but I'm ok either way.)\n\nThis change would help avoid the pain of managing export lists and should make libraries easier to write. Often people look at the definitions of items and want to know then and there whether the item is public or not.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "pcwalton", "id": 157897, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton", "html_url": "https://github.com/pcwalton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1893/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1893/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
