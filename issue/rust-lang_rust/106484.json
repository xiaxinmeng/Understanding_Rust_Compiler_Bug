(commercial use not only for developing test)\r\nBut, our target is mainly based on \"armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf\" which is placed to \"Tier2\".\r\nAccording to the docs, I read that \"Tier1 is guaranteed to work\" and \"Tier2 is guaranteed to build\".\r\n\r\nIf we have a plan to release the target as a product,\r\nIt means \"armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf\" is NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK at all (including a sub-compatibility)?\r\nThat makes us to hesitate to adopt rust to our product....\r\n\r\nIf Tier2 CANNOT be guaranteed to work or sub-compatibility, we'd love to the target is being promoted to Tier1. Is it possible?\r\nAlthough I read the doc about \"Target Tier Policy\", the process of promoting to \"Tier1\" is a bit ambiguous to me.\r\nWhat kind of things are required for that?\r\nAnd where can I start suggesting or raising issue \"armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf\" to promote to Tier1?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.", "closed_by": {"login": "jyn514", "id": 23638587, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjM4NTg3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23638587?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514", "html_url": "https://github.com/jyn514", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jyn514/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/106484/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/106484/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
