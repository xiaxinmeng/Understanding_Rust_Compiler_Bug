To help with this, we'll allow shared-kind parameters to be specified as such explicitly, and emit a warning when a non-explicit shared type param could be wider.\n\nAs part of this, I'll also abbreviate the keywords for kinds, to be more in line with the rest of the language: `pin`, `unq`, and `shr`.
