However, this is not the case for the binary created by `rustc`, here the main function first jumps to `foo_do_something` which then does nothing but to jump to `foo::do_something`.\r\n\r\nI've tested this with `rustc 1.53.0` and `clang 12.0.0`", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86745/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/86745/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
