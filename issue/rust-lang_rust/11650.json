Generally, the only new language features added after this milestone must be backwards compatible, or to fix soundness holes, though we do expect to have some leeway to make small incompatible fixes that have low impact on existing code bases.\r\n\r\n* Library stability - We have a system of measuring and ensuring the stability of API's, and a significant portion of the standard library is declared stable. Stable API's will not change. Large portions of the standard library need to be stable for 1.0, including primitive types, vectors, strings, option, numerics, collections, some I/O and concurrency.\r\n\r\n* User experience - The system is polished and the presentation is complete and professional. New users have a clear path to using and learning the system. This encompasses the web site, documentation, installation, and tooling.\r\n", "creator": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 376, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2013-10-10T18:48:33Z", "updated_at": "2016-08-28T23:13:24Z", "due_on": "2015-05-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2015-05-21T20:59:13Z"}, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2014-01-18T17:52:55Z", "updated_at": "2014-05-15T17:06:45Z", "closed_at": "2014-05-15T17:06:45Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "@kballard pointed out in IRC that the argument types for `std::run::Process::new` and `std::unstable::dynamic_library::open_external` are wrong for a couple reasons:\n- They don't quite work like proper paths. `Process::new` wraps the syscall `execvp`, which looks in the current directory for `\"./foo\"`, but in the `PATH` search paths for `\"foo\"`. `open_external` uses `dlopen`, does the same thing with the `DL_LIBRARY_PATH` or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables. Since `Path::new` automatically normalizes the paths, it turns a local reference of `\"./foo\"` into `\"foo\"`, which changes the semantics of the syscall.\n- In the case of `Process::new`, it uses `~str` for the program and arguments, but on Unix paths have no encoding.\n- In the case of `dynamic_library::open_external`, on Macs you can embed special [dyld macros](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man1/dyld.1.html) as in `\"@executable_path/../foo\"`, which will look for a library relative to the location of the executable.\n\nBecause of these issues, I feel that the only real option is to have those methods take `&[u8]`, or a trait that can produce one, like `std::path::BytesContainer`. \n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11650/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11650/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
