GAnarchy is a \"project page generator\", written in Python, designed to encourage anarchy-based development models.\r\n\r\nRather than having pull requests coming from \"peripheral\" repos into a \"central\" repo, and issues that only make sense on the \"central\" repo, GAnarchy proposes a development model where there is no \"central\" repo and no pull requests, instead having every repo owner pull from random other repos as they see fit.\r\n\r\nAnyone can become a repo owner and be listed on a GAnarchy instance. This means the project loses the idea of a \"vision\" (as defined by the developers) and instead becomes need-driven (or user-driven).\r\n\r\n[This paragraph refers to a future, unpublished, work-in-progress version of GAnarchy] Issues are not tracked in a central location, either, but are instead aggregated from multiple fediverse instances. Anyone on the fediverse (also erroneously referred to as \"mastodon\") can open issues. Any GAnarchy instance may include these issues, or they may exclude these issues, and the issues are sorted by activity so as to prevent off-topic issues from sticking around.\r\n\r\nObviously, GAnarchy isn't the only tool that can do this. Or rather, it actually may be. I don't know of another tool like GAnarchy but I'd love to be proven wrong! GAnarchy should not be the *only* way to run a project using an anarchy-based development model.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this kind of development model, with the help of GAnarchy or any other tool or just a strong community willing to make it work, would throw a wrench in the parent company's hostility plans. Anyway this got too long and now I'm lost, but, to put it simple, I believe this \"alternative\" development model would make things a lot better for Rust. All it really requires is a \"project commit\": an empty commit that defines the project title and description. See [the GAnarchy README](https://cybre.tech/SoniEx2/ganarchy#usage) for what the commit message should look like.\r\n\r\nPlease don't let mozilla throw Rust in the bin. If it's what it takes, give it back to the community instead.", "closed_by": {"login": "Centril", "id": 855702, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTcwMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/855702?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril", "html_url": "https://github.com/Centril", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Centril/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60339/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60339/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
