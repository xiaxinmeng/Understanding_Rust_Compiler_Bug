It entered Homu's queue at #5, and made it as high as #3 not long after that. It's now #14 in the queue. It got added to a roll-up, but that roll-up failed tests, and so I have no idea when it will be merged.\n\nI find this _very_, _very_ frustrating. When a PR of mine is finished I like for it to be merged ASAP, to minimize the chance of merge conflicts, and so I can forget about it and focus entirely on other things.\n\nIf Homu simply merged PRs in the order that they were added to the list, that would make things fairer and more predictable. (Having the ability to bump priorities for things like roll-ups would still be fine; some merges have good reason to be higher priority.)\n\nI anticipate some counter-arguments, so let me preemptively rebut them.\n- \"It'll get merged eventually, and the merge order doesn't matter.\" To a neutral observer of the entire system, correct, it doesn't much matter. To an individual developer, it definitely does matter. (Trust me, I am deeply frustrated about #37064's progress right now!)\n- \"The real problem is that merging is too slow.\" Well, yes, if merging took no time then this would matter a lot less. But that's not the case, and making it not the case sounds difficult and not likely to happen soon. Whereas changing the queue ordering sounds straightforward, and so would be easy to do quickly.\n- \"If the queue gets long your PR will end up in a roll-up anyway.\" Perhaps, but if it gets bumped repeatedly before going into the roll-up, it will end up taking a lot longer to get merged than it would have with a fair algorithm.\n\nFairness and predictability, that's all I want! :)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37107/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/37107/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
