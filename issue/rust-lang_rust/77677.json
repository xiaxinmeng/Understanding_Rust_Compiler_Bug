This kind of error message (the first one, `E0401`) had me puzzled for some time before figuring out that it was nonsensical. I\u2019m referring to the `try adding a local generic parameter in this method instead` part. The real code of course was _quite a bit_ longer, making the situation _actually_ confusing, in particular:\r\n* The `try adding ...` hint points to the wrong place entirely. It _should_ suggest adding a parameter to the `impl TraitG` (even though such a suggestion might not always make sense, idk).\r\n* The `type parameter from outer function` pointer is also somewhat confusing, since when `foo`\u2019s body is a few lines and `bar` is _super long and nested_, it is quite nontrivial to even figure out that \u201c`outer function`\u201d refers to `bar()`. (As in: it is easy to forget that you\u2019re even inside of a function body at all if you\u2019ve been focusing on this `Bar` struct and it\u2019s `impl`s for a while.) Also... what is the distinction between the words `function` and `method` here? (My original code has `bar(self)` but still called it \u201c`outer function`\u201d.)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n@rustbot modify labels: A-diagnostics, T-compiler, D-confusing, C-bug.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77677/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/77677/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
