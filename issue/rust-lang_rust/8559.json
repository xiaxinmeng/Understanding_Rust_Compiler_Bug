In the typeck data structures, these are represented separately, with the former in the `tcx.supertraits` map, and the latter as a field of `ty::TraitDef`.\n\nHowever, when encoded in the metadata, I just recycled the old code which would encode super-builtin-kinds as though they were regular supertraits (fixme in `metadata/encoder.rs`), and on the other side, repartition them into the two distinct sets when reading cross-crate trait info (fixmes in `metadata/decoder.rs`).\n\nA consequence of this is that in `typeck/collect.rs`, I had to make sure even the builtin supertraits were inserted into the `tcx.trait_refs` map so they could be encoded using the same old metadata code.\n\nIt would be better to encode a `TraitDef`'s builtin bounds like the separate field that it is. This would also require, in the `item_trait` case in `encoder.rs`, iterating over the `tcx.supertraits` map's value instead of iterating over what the AST thinks the supertraits are.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "arielb1", "id": 1830974, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzA5NzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1830974?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1", "html_url": "https://github.com/arielb1", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/arielb1/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8559/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/8559/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
