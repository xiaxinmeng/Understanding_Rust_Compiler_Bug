(And as far as I can tell, one cannot silence the warning away via `#[allow(..)]`.\r\n\r\nBut that switch is not as trivial as just changing the `#[derive(..)]`' in the tests, because the compiler complains that the definitions for those derives can not be found. It does suggest using `extern crate rustc_serialize;`.\r\n\r\nRight now I am deciding between just adding `*.stderr` files with the deprecation warning, or making the multiple nearly-trivial changes to the source files that the compiler is suggesting.
