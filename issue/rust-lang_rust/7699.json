This allows O(1) or O(logn) lookup/insert time, and constant time update/eviction with the recency list.\n\nThe representation is usually something like:\n\n``` c++\nstruct LRU<K,V> {\n    struct node<K,V> *tree_root;\n    struct node<K,V> *recency_head, *recency_tail;\n}\nstruct node<K,V> {\n    K key;\n    V value;\n    struct node<K,V> *tree_parent, *tree_left, *tree_right;\n    struct node<K,V> *recency_prev, *recency_next;\n}\n```\n\nThis is more difficult to represent in Rust. You could do it with `@mut` pointers, but we all know what would go wrong there, and also that would prevent you from sharing it between tasks. You could also do it with unsafe pointers. I suggest instead representing it as a vector, and replacing the pointers with indices into the vector.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "thestinger", "id": 1505226, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDUyMjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505226?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thestinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thestinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7699/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7699/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
