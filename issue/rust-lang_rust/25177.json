messages.\n\nConsider the following code ([playpen](http://is.gd/GZs71v))\n\n``` rust\nfn main()\n{\n    let ab = {\n        let thing = match (1, 2) {\n            (_, _) => println!(\"Hello\"),\n        }\n        (3, 4)\n    };\n}\n```\n\nThis prints the error message\n\n```\n<anon>:8:5: 8:6 error: expected one of `.`, `;`, or an operator, found `}`\n<anon>:8     };\n             ^\n```\n\nI spent a little while staring at this confused, saying to myself \"but there _is_ a semicolon there, after the `}`\" ... of course, the message was 100% correct in its content.\n\nThe question is: What can we do to provide better feedback in a case like this (where the true error lies earlier in the stream).\n\nOne idea I had was that it might help to increase the span to include the preceding token, i.e. to make the message indicate \"I found a `}` after the `)` in `(3,4)`, expected one of ...\"\n\nAnother idea: While parsing, track stylistic anti-patterns like whitespace separating a function expression from the parentheses for its arguments in a call-expression, and then report them as part of the error report.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365,
