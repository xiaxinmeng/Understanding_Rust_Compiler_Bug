This is ideal for discriminant size, and even for struct size. The bad part is that we add explicit padding (7 bytes on 64-bit machines) to make up for the middle padding. This leads to horrible things like unaligned moves in LLVM and alloca's of 7 bytes.\n\nI believe that it may actually be better for a discriminant to be the smallest size above or equal to the maximum alignment of the struct. So in the above case the discriminant would actually become `uint`, and for `Option<u8>` it would remain `u8`. This would remove any padding between the discriminant and the beginning of the data.\n\ncc @jld, I think this would remove some need for `tbaa.struct` for now, although we'll still want that eventually. I'm also not sure if reading a word is more efficient than reading a byte, but it kinda seems so to me?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11551/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/11551/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
