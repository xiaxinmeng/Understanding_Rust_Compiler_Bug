This is usually what we want.\r\n\r\nHowever, if `rustc` is being used in build infrastructure where the actual directory and pathnames differ from the \"canonical\" ones, it would be useful to be able to remap the pathnames into the canonical form in the debug info, so that they're useful for debugging.\r\n\r\ngcc and clang have the `-fdebug-prefix-map=old=new` option, which matches each source path against the `old` prefix and remaps it to `new` in the debug info (non-matching paths are unchanged). I think we can copy this design, with a `-C debug-prefix-map=<old>=<new>` (though I'm not thrilled that it can't deal with paths with an `=` in them).", "closed_by": {"login": "jsgf", "id": 147966, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0Nzk2Ng==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147966?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf", "html_url": "https://github.com/jsgf", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsgf/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39067/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39067/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
