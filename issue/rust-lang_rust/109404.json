However, due to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89986, this doesn't happen with staticlibs. This makes debugging code linked statically into a C++ project harder.\r\n\r\nI created a mostly-minimal reproduction of the issue here: https://github.com/obsgolem/rust-staticlib-issue-repro\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, make sure you are on a Windows machine with VS installed. Then do roughly the following:\r\n```\r\ncd cmake_test\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\ncmake ..\r\n```\r\nOnce this is done, open the Visual Studio solution and build all in Debug. Set the startup project to test, then set a breakpoint in `lib.rs:5`. When you hit the breakpoint, note that the debugger doesn't recognize the layout of the `Vec`.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the expected behavior, remove the `staticlib` entry from `CMakeLists.txt:14` and change the `crate-type` in `Cargo.toml` to `cdylib`. Then, following a clean build, you will find the debugger will correctly pick up the natvis for `Vec`.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/109404/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/109404/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
