I think it would be perfect to have a `xor` method, very similar to the `or` method:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\nimpl<T> Option<T> {\r\n\r\n    //...\r\n\r\n    fn xor(self, optb: Option<T>) -> Option<T> {\r\n        match (&self, &optb) {\r\n            (&Some(_), &None) => self,\r\n            (&None, &Some(_)) => optb,\r\n            _ => None,\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that would solve my problem nicely, and could be useful for a lot of people as well.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/50512/reactions", "total_count": 15, "+1": 15, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/50512/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
