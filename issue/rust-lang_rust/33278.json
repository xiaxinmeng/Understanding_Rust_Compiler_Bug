In `rustc` terms, I think this would be `-C +vfp2,+v7-a,+thumb2`.  AFAICT, this is somewhat different than the `arm-linux-androideabi` target, which appears to not assume the existence of an FPU, and also doesn't compile as Thumb where possible.  When using Rust on Android, we'd like our Rust libraries to be just as well optimized as our C++ libraries, which means either a) having an official, tier-2 supported target; or b) compiling it ourselves.\n\nOne could multiply ARM targets to no end, but this seems like a pretty reasonable target for many Android devices out there.  Is it possible to have this target added and supported?\n\ncc @alexcrichton \n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33278/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33278/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
