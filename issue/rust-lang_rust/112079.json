There is a clear notice that it is an experimental API, but no indication of what the experimental API does or when one would enable it.\r\n\r\nThere is a brief explanation in the unstable book, which is very clear and helpful:\r\n\r\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/language-features/yeet-expr.html\r\n\r\nMy \"expected behavior\" is that the `std::ops::Yeet` docs on the official website should (1) link [the unstable book passage](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/language-features/yeet-expr.html) (2) briefly explain the relationship between the yeet feature and std::ops::Yeet\r\n\r\n#### \"Why did you file this as an issue and not a PR?\"\r\n\r\nI would be happy to make a PR, but I don't fully understand how docstrings get out of the codebase and onto doc.rust-lang.org/std. If I look at the source for the Yeet trait https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/ops/try_trait.rs.html#434 there appears to be a sensible one-sentence docstring explanation of my expected \"(2)\" (explains how Yeet relates to yeet). But that sentence doesn't appear on doc.rust-lang.org/std. So I think it would be perfect if that docstring added a link to the unstable book, but if the docstring *isn't on the website* then apparently I don't understand how to file a PR on the std website.", "closed_by": {"login": "mcclure", "id": 277318, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzMxOA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277318?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcclure", "html_url": "https://github.com/mcclure", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcclure/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcclure/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcclure/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcclure/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcclure/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcclure/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcclure/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcclure/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcclure/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/112079/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/112079/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
