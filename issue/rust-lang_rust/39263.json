Not only this call-to-action won\u2019t be visible with text alraedy entered, it does not really help with identifying the purpose of the field.\r\n\r\nI realised this when got to a windows machine for some screen reader tests (for https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/39246) and had the placeholder read out to me. Screen reader, when focused on the field read out:\r\n\r\n> Click or press S to search, ? for more options editable field\r\n\r\nand I realised that this placeholder doesn\u2019t make sense even when I\u2019m able to see the page, much less when I don\u2019t.\r\n\r\n![Quick prototype with `Search terms` for placeholder](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/679122/22225998/4081782e-e1cd-11e6-80ed-a8f2c992da5b.png)\r\n\r\nI quickly prototyped a potential change and filled this issue so anybody with better ideas could chime in.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39263/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39263/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
