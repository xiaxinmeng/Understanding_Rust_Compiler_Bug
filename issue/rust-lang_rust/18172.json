There are comments around (such as [here in html5ever](https://github.com/servo/html5ever/blob/cb98c0cb700835f7473a9fc09a7ee9564ef3c73e/src/lib.rs#L16-L18)) that using `#![no_std]` should be used if one wants to write a Rust library that is going to be used from other languages. It's not really clear to me how accurate that recommendation still is currently / will be at 1.0 with the changes to std that have happened over the past months; however, assuming it's still true, I think there are a couple of problems that don't seem to have easy solutions:\n- It's really easy to accidentally pull in std by using another crate that links std (html5ever currently has this problem - servo/html5ever#47).\n- According to [the unsafe docs](http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide-unsafe.html#avoiding-the-standard-library), a crate using `#![no_std]` needs to define a few lang_items like `stack_exhausted`. If two independently-developed crates both define the lang items, you get duplicate name errors when trying to use both simultaneously.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18172/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18172/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
