It still has an issue though with false positives around crates that contain natively linkable stuff, like `-sys` crates for example. The issue has been discussed in PR #42588 already, however it has been dismissed, because its a similar situation to the `bad_style` lint. There is a difference though, which is that you disable the lint at the declaration site, not the use site.\r\n\r\nThe difference became a very visible in my `werk` crate. I was having a bunch of integration tests each only linking to my werk crate to get the native API it offers, and I had to add `#![allow(unused_extern_crate)]` to [every single integration test](https://github.com/est31/werk/commit/9623fb5a441465e758a79b29da951e2a8e7184a8), while I had to allow the bad_style lint only in once place. That's not nice!\r\n\r\nIt would be cool if the false positive doesn't get fixed, there at least was a feature where I could do something with the werk crate so that the \"unused\" `extern crate werk` doesn't become a warning. This is not just interesting for my particular use case which is probably a bit niche compared to mainstream. Its also interesting if you look into the future (#44660), where `#[allow(unused_extern_crate)] extern crate foo;` becomes legacy, and you'd probably have to think about either having to add a way to disable the lint in Cargo.toml, or the only way to disable the lint will be globally for all dependencies by doing `#![allow(unused_extern_crate)]` in {lib,main}.rs. I think what I suggest is better than those two alternatives.\r\n\r\ncc @aturon\r\ncc @ishitatsuyuki ", "closed_by": {"login": "est31", "id": 8872119, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzIxMTk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8872119?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31", "html_url": "https://github.com/est31", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/est31/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44827/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44827/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
