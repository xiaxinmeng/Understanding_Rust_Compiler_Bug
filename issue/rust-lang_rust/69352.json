The differences most often seem to be in stage 1's libparking_log, librustc_parse, or librustc_driver.\r\n\r\nA git bisect suggests that this was caused by 138c50f0af57e2631aa09092b826e2c3efd224d2, although due to the fact that this issue is itself difficult to reproduce this could potentially be incorrect.  But after many builds with and without that patch, I have only seen the error with it.  Assuming that is correct, I believe this issue might well be due to non-determinism in LLVM's `-O3`, but I'm not sure how to run just the LLVM portion on the compile so I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nNote that this is a part of #34902.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69352/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/69352/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
