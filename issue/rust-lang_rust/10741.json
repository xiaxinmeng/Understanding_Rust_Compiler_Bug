Right now the archive includes the `crate.o` and all native static dependencies. There's no reason that this file couldn't also include `crate.bc` to allow for LTO.\n\nI would imagine that a `--lto` option would be specified when creating an executable and for when creating a dynamic library (I don't think this makes sense for static libraries?). When `--lto` is specified, then we don't load the `bc` files from all of the upstream `rlib` archives and throw it all into LLVM, then we tell LLVM to run its LTO passes.\n\nBasically this would mean perhaps shoving more things into `rlib` archives by default (need to make sure that using rlib files still works), and then implementing the `--lto` option to load the `bc` files from archives. \n\nNote that native libraries should all still \"just work\" to the greatest extent possible.\n\nNot quite an easy bug, but certainly an interesting project!\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10741/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/10741/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
