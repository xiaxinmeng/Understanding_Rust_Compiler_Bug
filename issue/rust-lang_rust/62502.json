Skip implementing `std::error::Error` for their error type, giving up error ergonomics for users regardless of whether or not they care about no_std\r\n2. Hide the implementation of `std::error::Error` behind a feature, which is awkward.\r\n    - And if you already have `alloc` behind a feature, now you end up with separate `alloc` and `std` features (which is the option I took [in one of my crates](https://github.com/thomcc/rust-base16/tree/a5321823aa9361279d12ee460aa99ca1a4e62ddf#no_std-usage), and is mostly why I'm filing this) but is tedious, and makes your library have a larger configuration surface than feels necessary.\r\n3. Ignore no_std completely (what most crates do and will probably continue to do).\r\n\r\nBummers, all of them.\r\n\r\nIf Error is moved to `alloc`, while not *ideal* <sup>[1]</sup>, it would make things easier for the relatively common case of library crates that could otherwise be `no_std` + `alloc`, but don't want to give up error handling ergonomics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<b>[1]</b>: I think having `Error` in `core` makes more sense, but IIUC it can't: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/33149 (my read of this, which is probably wrong in some way, is that it's more or less because `Error::downcast` needs to be able to return a `Box<T>`)\r\n\r\nAs far as I know nothing prevents it from being in `alloc` (since Box is present in `alloc`), but I could easily be missing something important.\r\n\r\nanyway thx for coming to my ted talk", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62502/reactions", "total_count": 13, "+1": 5, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 8, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62502/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
