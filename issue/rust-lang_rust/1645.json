for enum types.  Effectively we treat them as `[u8]` at all times.  This causes a variety of problems. Mostly it causes poor interaction with shape code and C code, which assumes that we do alignment correctly.  I think there is probably an issue for this but I haven't found one that specifically describes it.  \n\nSome symptoms:\n- # 1535: Replacing a type like `int` with `enum foo { foo(int) }` is not equivalent.  It will cause shape code to misbehave when doing comparisons and the like because shape code will try to align to a word boundary, but the data will be stored with no alignment at all.  (For example, I tried to replace `ty::t` with such a type)\n- Converting tag discriminants from int to i32 does not work because the payloads are no longer properly aligned on 64-bit targets.  Basically, it works now by accident because int is 64-bits and we don't have any payloads of greater than 8-byte alignment.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "luqmana", "id": 287063, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzA2Mw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/287063?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/luqmana", "html_url": "https://github.com/luqmana", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luqmana/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luqmana/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luqmana/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luqmana/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luqmana/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luqmana/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luqmana/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luqmana/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luqmana/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1645/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1645/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
