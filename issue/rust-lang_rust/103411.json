Now it's linear (not exponential), but the constant factor is very high.\r\n* The slow pass is still `item_bodies_checking`.\r\n* Nearly 100% of the time is spent in `probe_for_return_type`.\r\n* I flattened this testcase from `1 = 1 = ... = 1;` to repeats of `1 = ();`. This doesn't affect the speed, but may make the sample tree easier to read.\r\n* It becomes 5x faster if I add `#![no_std]`. This strikes me as odd because I wouldn't expect anything in `std` to make this assignment valid.\r\n\r\n@rustbot label +I-compiletime", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103411/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/103411/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
