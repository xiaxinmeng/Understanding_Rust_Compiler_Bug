I've searched for issues under these keywords but found nothing, so here goes...\r\n     I've been noticing that the Rust compiler is *extremely* slow on WSL (windows subsystem for linux) running the newest ubuntu version. Compiling a simple hello world program takes in excess of 25 seconds, which is extremely excessive. This problem isn't noticed on native windows, and the only main performance difference between WSL and native is disk IO speed, so that's probably the issue. Antivirus is off. People have said that it's because of the numerous temporary and internal files created... maybe reduce the count of those or merge them into a few big files? Other compilers are orders of magnitude quicker than rustc, even on WSL.", "closed_by": {"login": "workingjubilee", "id": 46493976, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDkzOTc2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46493976?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee", "html_url": "https://github.com/workingjubilee", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/workingjubilee/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55684/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/55684/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "not_planned"}
