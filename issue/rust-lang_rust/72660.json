Indeed, it errors when `TEST` is used in the definition of `TEST_2`. However, it *also* warns that `TEST` isn't used; so it has a conflicting definition of what counts as \"use\".\r\n  * Extra verbosity not being great, we could get rid of the \"not used\" warning here and resolve the conflict of definitions in one go.\r\n* The error message \"any use of this value will cause an error\" gets repeated. I think the word choice \"any\" fits well to the warning at definition site, but on the usage site better would be: \"error: use of ill-defined/erroneous/something? constant\" Maybe also the secondary span could be shortened not to include the item definition; as for me, it muddles the distinction of definition and usage even more. (Might be just here, though, as the usage and definition site are quite similar in this example?)\r\n* The message \"note: `#[deny(const_err)]` on by default\" is confusing: yes, the default setting for `const_err` is `deny`, but it isn't actually `deny` here. Is the default setting what you wanted to tell about? How is it relevant, especially as it would be better conveyed in the earlier \"note: the lint level is defined here\" warning?\r\n  * Edit: I understood a bit more about the \"note: `#[deny(const_err)]` on by default\" message. `#[deny(const_err)]` is a per-item attribute, so it notes that it's on by default... *on this item*. The message could be better.\r\n### Meta\r\nReproduces on Rust version: 1.43.1 && latest nightly 2020-05-26.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/72660/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/72660/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
