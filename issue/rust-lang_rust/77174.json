In that\r\ncase, you can use use `issue = \"none\"` in your initial implementation PR. The\r\nreviewer will ask you to open a tracking issue if they agree your feature can be\r\nadded without an RFC.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFeature gate: `#![feature(inherent_ascii_escape)]`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude a short description of the feature.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor most library features, it'd be useful to include a summarized version of the public API.\r\n(E.g. just the public function signatures without their doc comments or implementation.)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl u8 {\r\n    pub fn escape_ascii(self) -> core::ascii::EscapeDefault;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl [u8] {\r\n    pub fn escape_ascii(&self) -> EscapeAscii<'_>;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// core::slice\r\npub struct EscapeAscii<'a>;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn the simplest case, this is a PR implementing the feature followed by a PR\r\nthat stabilises the feature.
