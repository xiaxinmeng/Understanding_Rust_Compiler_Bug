This should be easy and impactful to optimize.\r\n\r\nLRUCache lives in components/style/cache.rs. It currently uses a VecDeque to manage a circular list of entries (to avoid copying when adding elements to the front of the list), which never grows. We can avoid the heap-allocation by using an inline buffer instead of a VecDeque.\r\n\r\nThe easiest approach would probably be to make a minimal wrapper around ArrayVec called ArrayVecDeque, which tracks the current \"front\" of the list and exposes an iterator that iterates the entries in order.", "closed_by": {"login": "bholley", "id": 377435, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzQzNQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377435?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bholley", "html_url": "https://github.com/bholley", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bholley/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bholley/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bholley/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bholley/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bholley/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bholley/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bholley/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bholley/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bholley/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42244/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/42244/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
