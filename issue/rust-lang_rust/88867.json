Team members should feel free to ask me to grant them edit permissions to this spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nThe \"tentative team\" and \"tentative verdict\" columns are guessed and not binding. Teams should feel free to edit them.\r\n\r\nTeams can \"claim\" a crate by adding their name to the \"Investigating team\" column.  This means they are committing to figuring out which category the crate belongs to, if it is indeed their crate. It is acceptable for a team to run this process and determine that the crate is in fact not theirs, and hand it over to the team they think owns it. If a team has claimed a crate that you think better belongs to yours, please contact them and work it out.\r\n\r\nOnce a team has made decisions on a crate, they should update the \"verdict\" column and make the appropriate edits to the crate readme. Ideally, they should also fix up the crate permissions to only contain rust-lang-owner and the GitHub team.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88867/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/88867/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
