But in fact, the full range that i64 seconds gives us is restricted to `i64::MAX` milliseconds (see #16626 for more details). \n\nI offer to change the internal representation of `Duration` to\n\n```\npub struct Duraion {\n    ticks: i64,  // A single tick represents 100 nanoseconds  \n    nanos: i8  // to hold values from -99 to 99\n}\n```\n\nSome pros:\n1. Internals of `struct Duraion` are not exposed. So, we are free to change them.\n2. New representation is 3 bytes smaller.\n3. Methods like `num_milliseconds` etc will return correct i64 values (see #16626).\n4. `TimeSpan` in .NET and `Duration` in Joda-Time types do the same.\n\nSome cons:\n1. The overall range of values for `Duration` will be shorter:\n   - `i64::MAX` seconds gives us 106751991167300 days. We don't use <s>need</s> it.\n   - `i64::MAX` milliseconds gives us 106751991167 days. This is our current choice.\n   - `i64::MAX` ticks gives us 10675199 days. The range is still long enough, who cares?\n2. ?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18416/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/18416/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
