This will bite us hard as soon as the compiler starts inserting yield-checks.\n  -- Easy solution: Add a preempt_disable counter in the rt scheduler, \u00e0 la linux spinlocks, that it checks every yield\n  -- Hard solution: Make the scheduler know how to reschedule to the owner of a lock on the same core. (Still requires unkillable, I think)\n- `fn lock(fn() -> T) -> T` is a cute interface, but doesn't support lock interleaving.
