Either way, it still seems like a good idea though.\n\n---\n\nErrors such as #18946 would benefit from being multiline e.g. the second would be an improvement over the first:\n\n```\n<anon>:2:5: 2:10 error: mismatched types: expected `core::option::Option<int>`, found `core::result::Result<_, _>` (expected enum core::option::Option, found enum core::result::Result)\n```\n\n```\n<anon>:2:5: 2:10 error: mismatched types: expected `core::option::Option<int>`,\n                                             found `core::result::Result<_, _>`\n                                         (expected enum `core::option::Option`,\n                                             found enum `core::result::Result`)\n```\n\nSimple whitespace padding on single line errors cannot be implemented because of how it interacts with word wrapping (see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/19203#issuecomment-64301925). A better way would be to optionally enable multiline errors e.g. via compiler flags. However, a compiler flag for just one error may be overkill.\n\nThis bug is to collect errors which could be improved by being multiline errors and the way they should be improved. Then a more comprehensive fix can be enabled later.\n\ncc @P1start @steveklabnik @jakub- @sinistersnare\n\n---\n\nAlso might have other creative uses like improving #16619.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mdinger", "id": 4156987, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQxNTY5ODc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4156987?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/mdinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mdinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19464/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/19464/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
