The reason appears to be that the 32-bit test builders (both MSVC and GNU) are the slowest, taking the \"full\" 150 minutes even on a good day.\r\n\r\nI'm not that sure what the best solution is - eventually we could play with checkpoint/restart, but I would not want to do that on Windows first.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's possible to investigate the cause of the slowness, or to bump the time limit, or to split the pc-windows-gnu builders (the latter would also speed up the cycle time).\r\n\r\nHowever, the Windows 32-bit test builders being the slowest of our entire group seems to be a good cause to split them (this also makes some sense, because they spawn a lot of processes, which is slow on Windows).\r\n\r\nCases:\r\n\r\n - https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rust-lang/rust/build/1.0.5550 (#46144) - MSYS_BITS=32 test pc-windows-gnu, 2017-11-29\r\n - https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rust-lang/rust/build/1.0.5550 (#46366) - MSYS_BITS=32 test pc-windows-gnu, 2017-11-29\r\n - https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rust-lang/rust/build/1.0.5559 (#46370) - MSYS_BITS=32 test pc-windows-gnu, 2017-11-30\r\n - https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rust-lang/rust/build/1.0.5743 (#46802) - MSYS_BITS=32 test pc-windows-gnu, 2017-12-18\r\n - https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rust-lang/rust/build/1.0.5756 (#46733) - MSYS_BITS=32 test pc-windows-gnu, 2017-12-20\r\n - https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rust-lang/rust/build/1.0.5765 (#46752) - MSYS_BITS=32 test pc-windows-gnu, 2017-12-21", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46903/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/46903/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
