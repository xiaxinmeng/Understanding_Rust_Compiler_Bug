Full LTO doesn't have the slowdown.\r\n\r\nHere's the [source code](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/d4ed6e2cb486becf081eb7da75133a32d83829d4/src/diagnostics/inspect_validator/src/data/scanner.rs#646) which is causing the regression. The function has about 20 `.await` points, which I suspect might be related. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with inlining the awaited function (I replaced it with a panic and linking was still slow).\r\n\r\n~Here's the LLVM IR for the fast and slow cases (built with the above commits of rustc, respectively): [llvm-ir.zip](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/files/3800043/llvm-ir.zip)~\r\nEDIT: See [below](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66036#issuecomment-562407697) for a reproducer\r\n\r\ncc @petrhosek \r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66036/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/66036/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
