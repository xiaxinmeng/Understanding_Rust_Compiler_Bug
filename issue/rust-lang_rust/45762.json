AFL has two components needed to integrate it with an LLVM-based language:\r\n\r\n- [instrumentation (an LLVM pass)](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/afl.rs/blob/master/afl-plugin/afl-llvm-pass.so.cc)\r\n- \u200e[a runtime](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/afl.rs/blob/master/afl/src/afl-llvm-rt.o.c)\r\n\r\n[afl.rs](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/afl.rs/) is a project intended to help setup their Rust project for fuzzing with AFL. In particular,\r\nafl.rs attempts to [register the LLVM pass](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/afl.rs/blob/master/afl-plugin/build.rs) and [dynamically link the runtime](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/afl.rs/blob/master/afl/build.rs), but it [rarely works](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/afl.rs/issues/57) as it relies on the linker/compiler having ABI compatibility with whatever one has on their own system.\r\n\r\nConsidering how important fuzzing is for building secure and reliable systems, and how big the security community is around AFL, I propose the AFL instrumentation and runtime be available behind an unstable flag in the compiler.\r\n\r\nIf people seem to agree and think this is a good idea, I'd love to help out getting this implemented, though my knowledge on how best to do this in rustc is very limited and would love advice.", "closed_by": {"login": "frewsxcv", "id": 416575, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjU3NQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/416575?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv", "html_url": "https://github.com/frewsxcv", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45762/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/45762/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
