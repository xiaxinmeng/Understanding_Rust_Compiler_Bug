what is the order of operations\n   eddyb_ | (-(1u8)) as u64\n   eddyb_ | arrrrrrr1: lol it's so wrong\n   eddyb_ | arrrrrrr1: it doesn't normalize the expression to its type\n   eddyb_ | arrrrrrr1: so -(1u8) produces const_uint(-1u64)\n   eddyb_ | same for !0u8\n   eddyb_ | arrrrrrr1: and... casts ignore bit sizes so there's no truncate or zero/sign-extend\n   eddyb_ | arrrrrrr1: rustc::middle::const_eval::eval_const_expr_partial is just wrong. if you want the location of the wrong code :P\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id":
