It's not as minimal as maybe it could be because it's a little tricky to figure out what's causing the slow compiles and I've spent as much time as I can on this right now. It's very sensitive to seemingly irrelevant changes in the code. If I remove the unused `count` variable, compile times dramatically improve. If I remove the empty `for` loop, compile times dramatically improve.\r\n\r\nOn my actual project, I am getting compile times in excess of 20 minutes.
