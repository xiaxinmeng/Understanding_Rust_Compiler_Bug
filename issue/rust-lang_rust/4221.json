Creating large contiguous arrays is a commonplace operation in low-level programming, and users should not have to use a library function or macro to do it. The syntax used in the following examples is not optimal for a few reasons, but illustrates the point.\n\nFor example, to create a vector of zeroes that is 20 elements long, you could use the single expressions:\n\n```\n@[0, ...20];\n@[mut 0, ...20];\n```\n\nThe following function would create a vector that is `count` elements long, and every element has value `t`:\n\n```\nfn mk_buffer<T: Copy>(count: uint, t: T) -> ~[T] {\n    return ~[t, ...count]\n}\n```\n\nThis syntax could support interleaving of multiple values as well. The following function would create a vector that is `count` elements long, which alternates between the values `t1` and `t2`:\n\n```\nfn mk_alternating_buffer<T: Copy>(count: uint, t1: T, t2: T) \u27f6\u2002 ~[T] {\n    return ~[t1, t2, ...count];\n}\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "geoffhill-zz", "id": 37933, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTMz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37933?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffhill-zz", "html_url": "https://github.com/geoffhill-zz", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffhill-zz/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffhill-zz/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffhill-zz/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffhill-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffhill-zz/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffhill-zz/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffhill-zz/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffhill-zz/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffhill-zz/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4221/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/4221/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
