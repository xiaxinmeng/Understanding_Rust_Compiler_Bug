Example:\n\nhttp://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/\n\nThe rust documentation for str defines Structs, Enums, Traits and 3 Functions.\n\nSo... I'm lost. This isn't like any documentation for any other language I'm familiar with. For example, when I view the java documentation for String I get a list of every method I can call on the String.\n\nI can not find such a list for str.\n\nLet's say I want to search a str or run a regex against it.\n\nI looked in the Searcher trait, but there are no useful methods/functions for searching that I could see. The trait description is: This trait provides methods for searching for non-overlapping matches of a pattern starting from the front (left) of a string.\n\nI see no way to define a pattern or even search.\n\nI'm obviously totally missing it. Please help.\"\n\nA good starting point might be to copy the text from http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html into it, link explicitly to `StrExt`, and explain what `StrExt` is.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22902/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/22902/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
