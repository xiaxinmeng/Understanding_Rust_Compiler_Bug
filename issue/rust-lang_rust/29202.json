Previously when running `pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain` or `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain` MSYS2's pacman would fetch a 4.x version of gcc. However, the packages have been bumped, now giving gcc 5.2. This results in the issues outlined above.\n\nThis can be worked around by using MSYS2 but obtaining an alternative version of gcc. I've had success using MSYS2 but putting gcc 4.9 from [mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php) on the path.\n\nI imagine it may be possible to remedy this by passing different args when using gcc 5.2, but have not experimented with this. I'd be interested in if anyone has had any success with this method.\n\nShould the Windows build instructions be updated to reflect a work around for the above issues? I'd be happy to do so, but would like to have some discussion about the best direction to go with this.\n\nThis is a possible dupe of #28843, but I believe it is a separate issue.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29202/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29202/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
