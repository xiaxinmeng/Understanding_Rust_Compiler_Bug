However, this adds no value to the client of the API, since `decl_id` is enough to identify a struct.\n\nCurrently, some type references contain a `ref_id` that corresponds to the `ctor_id` of the type, instead of the `decl_id`. This forces clients of the API to keep a hashtable mapping from `ctor_id` to `decl_id` in case they want to get the original struct declaration.\n\n_Note: I have observed this only in tuple structs. It seems like normal structs don't even have a valid `ctor_id`_\n### Example\n\nImagine you want to get all references to `MyStruct` in the following program:\n\n``` rust\nstruct MyStruct; // decl_id: 1, ctor_id: 2\nfn main() {\n    let x = foo();\n}\n\nfn foo() -> MyStruct { // Here, the reference to MyStruct has ref_id: 1\n    MyStruct // Here, the reference to MyStruct has ref_id: 2 (the constructor)\n}\n```\n\nIdeally, both references should have `ref_id = 1`\n### Solution\n\nRemove the `ctor_id` field and modify the save code in such a way that references always point to a `decl_id` instead of a `ctor_id`.\n\ncc @nrc do you think this makes sense?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33398/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33398/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
