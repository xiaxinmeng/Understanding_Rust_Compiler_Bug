What do you want to do with x.py?\r\na) library: Contribute to the standard library\r\nb) compiler: Contribute to the compiler itself\r\nc) codegen: Contribute to the compiler, and also modify LLVM or codegen\r\nd) tools: Contribute to tools which depend on the compiler, but do not modify it directly (e.g. rustdoc, clippy, miri)\r\ne) user: Install Rust from source\r\nPlease choose one (a/b/c/d/e): \r\n```\r\nThis looks great for beginners! However, I am doing almost all of these things. Furthermore I am asked to do a choice that will probably change my config.toml but I don't know exactly what it does -- I don't have nearly enough information to answer these questions. Looking at https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/bootstrap/defaults, this affects things like whether debug assertions are enabled, whether LLVM is downloaded, etc -- for powerusers it makes a lot more sense to explicitly talk about those things than to hide them behind opaque labels such as \"compiler\" vs \"library\".\r\n\r\nIs `x.py setup` meant to be used only by beginners, or also by long-time rustc contributors? If the latter is the case, then currently I think it doesn't work. An easy work-around could be to let me select \"none of the above\", which probably corresponds to my current config (I don't have `profile` set, instead I have a carefully hand-crafted config.toml).\r\n\r\nIf `x.py setup` is meant to be ignored by people that are comfortable editing config.toml directly, then nothing needs to change here, but then things like https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/1588 are not great since of course I still want to be able to see what this year's way of configuring vscode for rustc work looks like.\r\n\r\nBasically what I am asking is, while you do your amazing work of making rustc easier to get into for beginners, please don't forget the experts. :)\r\n\r\nCc @jyn514 ", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/107846/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/107846/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
