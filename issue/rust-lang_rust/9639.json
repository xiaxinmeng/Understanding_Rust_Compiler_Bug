This is because Linux allows for non-unicode paths.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a lot of clients of `Path`, including related functionality like `Process` arguments and environment variables, that still use `&str`. These need to be updated to handle `&[u8]` so they can represent non-unicode `Path`s.\n\nAll of the known locations where this is an issue are marked up by `// FIXME` lines referencing this issue. Note that in the case of `Process` args and environments, these comments are at the usage locations rather than the implementation.\n\nSub-tasks that have been filed for various components:\n- [ ] #11916 `glob(\"*\")` does not support matching non-utf8 filenames\n- [x] #11650 `Process::new` and `dynamic_library::open_external` should take `&[u8]`s, not `Path`s or `~strs`\n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9639/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9639/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
