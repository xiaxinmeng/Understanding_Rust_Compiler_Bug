I originally [posted this to Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/4vlxmu/hey_rustaceans_got_an_easy_question_ask_here/d605t7s).\n\nHere's the code in question, reduced from real code:\n\n```\nuse std::ops::MulAssign;\n\npub trait Vector: MulAssign<<Self as Vector>::Component> {\n    type Component;\n}\n\npub trait VectorOp {\n    type Vector: Vector<Component=f32>;\n}\n\npub fn foo<O: VectorOp>(v: &mut O::Vector) {\n    *v *= 3.0f32;\n}\n```\n\n`foo` fails to compile. The compiler complains:\n\n```\nthe trait bound `<O as VectorOp>::Vector: std::ops::MulAssign<f32>` is not satisfied\n```\n\nIt seems to me that this bound should be satisfied since `VectorOp` says `VectorOp::Vector: Vector<Component=f32>`.\n\nFurther observations:\n- I can fix the error by adding `where O::Vector: MulAssign<f32>` to `foo`, but I feel like I shouldn't have to add that.\n- If I change the bound on `Vector` to simply `MulAssign<Self::Component>`, the compiler complains about \"unsupported cyclic reference between types/traits\". What I have seems equivalent, though, and the compiler doesn't complain about it. (This may be unrelated, but it seemed strange to me.)\n- Moving `foo` into `VectorOp` compiles:\n\n```\npub trait VectorOp {\n    type Vector: Vector<Component=f32>;\n    fn foo(v: &mut Self::Vector) {\n        *v *= 3.0f32;\n    }\n}\n```\n- Putting `foo` into a trait that extends `VectorOp` does not compile:\n\n```\ntrait Foo : VectorOp {\n    fn foo(v: &mut <Self as VectorOp>::Vector) {\n        *v *= 3.0f32;\n    }\n}\n```\n", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/35177/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/35177/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
