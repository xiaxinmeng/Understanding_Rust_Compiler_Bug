So I downloaded visualcppbuildtools_full.exe from\r\nMicrosoft's site and ran it, but it told me I needed at least .Net\r\nFramework 4.5.1. So I downloaded NDP451-KB2859818-Web.exe from Microsoft's\r\nsite and ran it. This worked, so I then ran visualcppbuildtools_full.exe\r\nwhich also worked and then ran rustup-init.exe.\r\nBut during rustup-init.exe's execution it popped up an error message\r\nsaying I needed MSVCR120.dll. I got an official link for this from the rust IRC channel and after installing it rust & cargo seem to be working.\r\n\r\nBut having to install 3 Microsoft exe files -- all found in different places on the Microsoft site is a poor user experience. Surely the installer could be smarter about its dependencies and grab what it needs that's missing?", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40054/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/40054/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
