One way to imagine this is that we'd alter the ABI of `fn bar`, as we usually do for `#[track_caller]` functions, to accept an additional parameter for the `Location`. When calling `bar()` we'd then propagate the location, again as usual.\r\n\r\nHowever, the place which actually defines `fn bar() { ... }` would not be aware of the `#[track_caller]` annotation, so it seems to me that we'd have to insert a shim where the `extern \"Rust\"` block resides.\r\n\r\nI've opened this issue to seek some clarity on what @eddyb meant as neither me nor @anp fully understood.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/70830/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/70830/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
