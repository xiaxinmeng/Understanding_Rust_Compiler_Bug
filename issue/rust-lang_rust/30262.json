The line multiplies `Tensor` by a `f32`, the `impl` regards `Tensor * Tensor`.\n- [This impl](https://gist.github.com/fizyk20/543f3d5263b722923f81) causes the same problem, but switching `impl<T, U> Mul<Tensor<T, U>> for Vector<T>` to `impl<T, U> Mul<Vector<T>> for Tensor<T, U>` causes the problem to go away (with no changes to the bounds).\n\nI'm aware that the code is long and I haven't provided much information - that's mostly because I have no idea where else to look for any clues. If there is something I can do to make this issue easier to analyze, please tell me and I'll do it.\n\nI'll also mention that I have build the debug version of rustc 1.4.0 to check the debug logs, but I have no idea what to look for. If something from the debug logs is needed, I can also generate it (provided I know what to generate).\n\nIf this is not a bug, but just me doing something stupid, I'd also love to hear what I'm doing wrong.\n\nI'd greatly appreciate any help or hint on how to debug this issue further :)\n\n**Update:** I have just found that changing\n\n``` rust\nlet result: Vector<Test2> = vector1 * 5.0;\n```\n\nto\n\n``` rust\nlet result: Vector<Test2> = <Vector<Test2> as Mul<f64>>::mul(vector1, 5.0);\n```\n\nmakes the code work. The same can be done to get multiplying vectors to work ([click](https://github.com/fizyk20/differential-geometry/blob/b70b38eb8abd3559935bdbe32738394ea4b70c25/src/tests.rs#L140)). I hope this will help.\n\n**Update 2:** This doesn't work, either:\n\n``` rust\nlet result: Vector<Test2> = Vector::<Test2>::mul(vector1, 5.0);\n```\n\nThis leads me to believe that something goes wrong when the compiler tries to choose the appropriate `Mul` implementation. Somehow this causes it to evaluate bounds for types it was never supposed to choose and overflow. I'm still not sure if this is a bug, but maybe there is a way to improve the algorithm :)\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30262/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/30262/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
