The distinction is that `DT_RPATH` takes precedence over the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable, whereas `DT_RUNPATH` does not. The latter is more convenient and means that rpaths are less likely to get in your way, since you can override them. `DT_RPATH` is also claimed to be deprecated by [the ld.so manpage](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html). So I think that `rustc -C rpath` should generate `DT_RUNPATH` where available.\n\nglibc has supported this since at least 1999. musl 1.1.6 (January 2015) seems to honor `DT_RUNPATH` but not treat it differently. You can emit both, and the GNU dynamic linker ignores `DT_RPATH`.\n\nYou can tell GNU ld to emit `DT_RUNPATH` instead of `DT_RPATH` by adding `--enable-new-dtags`, probably something like\n\n``` diff\ndiff --git a/src/librustc_back/rpath.rs b/src/librustc_back/rpath.rs\nindex 6674d31..e96f33d 100644\n--- a/src/librustc_back/rpath.rs\n+++ b/src/librustc_back/rpath.rs\n@@ -41,6 +41,7 @@ pub fn get_rpath_flags(config: &mut RPathConfig) -> Vec<String> {\n\n fn rpaths_to_flags(rpaths: &[String]) -> Vec<String> {\n     let mut ret = Vec::new();\n+    ret.push(\"-Wl,--enable-new-dtags\".to_string());\n     for rpath in rpaths {\n         ret.push(format!(\"-Wl,-rpath,{}\", &(*rpath)));\n     }\n```\n\nHowever, neither Apple's linker nor lld supports this, and I'm not really sure how to make this platform-conditional.
