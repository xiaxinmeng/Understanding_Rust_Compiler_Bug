Until this is the case, a discarded documentation comment should trigger a warning about an unsupported feature so the programmer would know the content wouldn't appear in the generated documentation.\n\nSome examples of discarded documentation comments are impls:\n\n```\n/// Description of a foo...\npub struct Foo { ... }\n\n/// Functions that bar the foo... - this comment is silently discarded by rustdoc.\nimpl Foo { pub fn bar(&self) { ... } }\n\n/// Functions that baz the foo... - this comment is silently discarded by rustdoc.\nimpl Foo { pub fn baz(&self) { ... } }\n```\n\nStruct members:\n\n```\npub struct Foo {\n    /// Bar field... - this comment is silently discarded by rustdoc.\n    bar: Bar,\n}\n```\n\nEnum constructors:\n\n```\npub enum Foo {\n    /// Bar constructor... - this comment is silently discarded by rustdoc.\n    Bar,\n}\n```\n\nAnd there are probably others. Omitting such comments from the output reduces the usefulness of the documentation; doing so silently means the programmer can't tell when his documentation is being discarded. \n", "closed_by": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9611/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/9611/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
