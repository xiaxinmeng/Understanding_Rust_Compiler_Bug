Generally, the only new language features added after this milestone must be backwards compatible, or to fix soundness holes, though we do expect to have some leeway to make small incompatible fixes that have low impact on existing code bases.\r\n\r\n* Library stability - We have a system of measuring and ensuring the stability of API's, and a significant portion of the standard library is declared stable. Stable API's will not change. Large portions of the standard library need to be stable for 1.0, including primitive types, vectors, strings, option, numerics, collections, some I/O and concurrency.\r\n\r\n* User experience - The system is polished and the presentation is complete and professional. New users have a clear path to using and learning the system. This encompasses the web site, documentation, installation, and tooling.\r\n", "creator": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 376, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2013-10-10T18:48:33Z", "updated_at": "2016-08-28T23:13:24Z", "due_on": "2015-05-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2015-05-21T20:59:13Z"}, "comments": 8, "created_at": "2014-07-08T13:27:22Z", "updated_at": "2015-04-11T01:59:24Z", "closed_at": "2015-04-11T01:59:24Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "``` rust\n#[deriving(Ord, PartialOrd, Eq, PartialEq, Show)]\nenum Foo {\n    A = 10,\n    B = 0,\n    C,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let v = [A, B, C];\n\n    println!(\"      deriving\\tdiscriminant\");\n    for x in v.iter() {\n        for y in v.iter() {\n            println!(\"{}, {}: {}  \\t{}\", *x, *y, x.cmp(y), (*x as uint).cmp(&(*y as uint)));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```\n      deriving  discriminant\nA, A: Equal     Equal\nA, B: Less      Greater\nA, C: Less      Greater\nB, A: Greater   Less\nB, B: Equal     Equal\nB, C: Less      Less\nC, A: Greater   Less\nC, B: Greater   Greater\nC, C: Equal     Equal\n```\n\nThat is, `deriving` considers `A` the smallest, but it has the largest discriminant.\n\nI would think that `#[deriving]` should be changed to use the explicit discriminants (if they are available), but there is some possibility that  declaration order may be the correct thing (you can always reorder the variants to match their discriminants).\n\nThere's also an edge case due to the (apparent?) untypedness of enum variant discriminants: when ordering `enum Foo { A = 1, B = -1 }`, is the discriminant of `B` considered negative, or is it positive and huge?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15523/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/15523/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
