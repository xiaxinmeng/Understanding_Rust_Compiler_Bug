One user was [`rustc_codegen_ssa::mir::analyze::LocalAnalyzer`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/fe10f1a49f5ca46e57261b95f46f519523f418fe/src/librustc_codegen_ssa/mir/analyze.rs#L49), which is doing a custom recursive traversal in [`process_place`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_codegen_ssa/mir/analyze.rs#L99). There's a [`HACK` comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/fe10f1a49f5ca46e57261b95f46f519523f418fe/src/librustc_codegen_ssa/mir/analyze.rs#L184-L186) from @eddyb suggesting that this should be rewritten.\r\n\r\n@eddyb, did you have something specific in mind? I spent some time trying to decipher the logic here, but there's parts I don't understand. For example, there's [a long comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/fe10f1a49f5ca46e57261b95f46f519523f418fe/src/librustc_codegen_ssa/mir/analyze.rs#L150-L170) about why we need to call `visit_local` for `NonUseContext::VarDebugInfo`, but `visit_local` [does nothing for `NonUse`s](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/fe10f1a49f5ca46e57261b95f46f519523f418fe/src/librustc_codegen_ssa/mir/analyze.rs#L277). What's the indended behavior here?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `LocalAnalyzer` visits basic blocks in numerical order, but [this code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/fe10f1a49f5ca46e57261b95f46f519523f418fe/src/librustc_codegen_ssa/mir/analyze.rs#L286-L291) assumes we will visit the assignment to a local before any uses of it. This isn't a soundness issue; The worst thing that can happen is that locals are placed onto the stack unnecessarily. However, I think we should be visiting basic blocks in RPO, no?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/72931/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/72931/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
