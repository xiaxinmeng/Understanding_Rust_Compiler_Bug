conditions, and imposes complex interactions between the runtime and libcore.\n\nThe current rules are something like this:\n- Children that fail cause their parents to fail\n- Parents that fail do not cause their children to fail\n- Children can be 'unsupervised', after which their failure does not propagate to their parents\n- Children of dead parents that fail cause their grandparents (and so on) to fail\n- The main task is supervised by the kernel\n- When the kernel fails all tasks are killed\n\nIssues:\n- Parents should probably also cause children to fail\n- Task notification (by which tasks can be informed of what the fate of other tasks was) is related, but the current semantics are not clear when linked failure is involved.\n- There is a known race condition between children killing their parents and the parent blocking on a port in which it is possible for the parent to yield forever.\n- Kernel level failure, upon which all tasks fail, is incredibly racy, basically broken.\n\nSee also: #1788 (redesign task API), #1857 (task-local data), #1078 (task notification)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bblum", "id": 1820515, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjA1MTU=", "avatar_url":
