It is possible to write an extension that does the same thing as `#[deriving(..)]` does, but it has to be implemented as `#[deriving_MyTrait]` instead of `#[deriving(MyTrait)]`. This unfortunate, especially when a user wants to derive multiple first- and third-party traits:\n\n``` rust\n#[deriving(Clone, Eq, Ord)]\n#[deriving_Foo]\n#[deriving_Bar]\n#[deriving_Baz]\npub struct Blah {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nThe repetition of multiple `#[deriving_Foo]`s was the driving force for the creation of `#[deriving(..)]` in the first place!\n# The Proposal\n\nChange the signature of the macro registration function to this:\n\n``` rust\npub type MacroCrateRegistrationFun =\n    fn(macro_callback: |Name, SyntaxExtension|,\n       deriving_callback: |~str, DerivingExtension|);\n```\n\n`#[deriving(..)]` types will be registered by the extension infrastructure just like other syntax extensions are.\n\nThis does have a (potentially) large downside: the extension infrastructure will have to have special knowledge of `#[deriving(..)]` to keep track of the registered extensions. I think it's probably worth it, and there are already some other \"special\" extensions like `trace_macros!`.
