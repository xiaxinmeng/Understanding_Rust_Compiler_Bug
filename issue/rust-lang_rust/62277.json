However, it would do a full build of the code, including codegen and linking. Many of our tests don't need this, however, and should instead use the new `check-pass`, introduced in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/61778. For tests that exercise codegen and linking, `build-pass` can be used instead.\r\n\r\nAs a first step, it would be good to remove `compile-pass` to prevent users adding new tests that unconsciously take a dependency on codegen/linking, and push them to use `check/build-pass` to make the distinction explicit.\r\n\r\nTo do this, we'd like to start with a mass migration of `compile-pass` tests to `build-pass` (rather than `check-pass` because we don't want to accidentally stop testing codegen/linking functionality). However, we don't want to lose the distinction between tests which are intentionally `build-pass` and those that have been automatically migrated, so automatically-migrated tests should include a note like `// build-pass (FIXME(this-issue-#): could be check-pass?)` or similar.\r\n\r\nOnce that's done, we can remove `compile-pass` and work on moving over the `FIXME`-tagged tests to either `check-pass` or remove the `FIXME`.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62277/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/62277/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
