However, there are some things that can be written in function/expression scope that still make it out into the public API. While that issue was about trait impls, it seems that inherent impls work in a similar way. Consider the following snippet:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn asdf() {\r\n    impl SomeStruct {\r\n        pub fn qwop(&self) {\r\n            println!(\"hidden function\");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let asdf = SomeStruct;\r\n    asdf.qwop(); // prints \"hidden function\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though `qwop()` was written in function scope, it's still visible globally because it was defined with `pub`. Rustdoc should collect these impls and display them.\r\n\r\nOne thing i'm curious about is whether we should show non-`pub` functions defined in non-module scope when `--document-private-items` is set. I think we can get away with it, because it already displays private functions there regardless of where they're defined.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53763/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/53763/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
