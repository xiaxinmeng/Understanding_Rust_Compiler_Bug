The is used in, e.g. `lazy-static`, store the result of the initialization function. It would be nice if `Once` became `Once<T = ()>` and offered the same expanded API.\r\n\r\nOne can always hand roll this with `Cell`, as `lazy-static` does when not using `spin`, but the composition of the `Once` and interior mutability is unsafe and thus requires extra care. This is exactly analogous to locks without the \"slot\", as POSIX threads defines the interface, also being unsafe/unergonomic.\r\n\r\nRelatedly, there have long been murmers of moving `lazy_static` itself into `std`. I'm personally on the fence about that, but if we do so I see no reason why not to generalize `Once` as this issue proposes. There is also https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs/issues/111 advocating less macro magic by having the `Lazy<T>` type be exposed. Well, that `Lazy<T>` is basically `Once<T>`.", "closed_by": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56664/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/56664/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
