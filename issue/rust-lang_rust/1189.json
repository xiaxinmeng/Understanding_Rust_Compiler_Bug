There is at least one race condition that could result in the task not being killed and never waking up.\n\nSeems like we should be able to maintain the relationships between tasks just using Rust messages. This is desirable because every bit of synchronization we eliminate from the runtime makes it easier to understand. There are some obstacles to being able to implement this though, primarily that we need to be able to select on multiple ports. Additionally, I don't really envision how reparenting would work.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bblum", "id": 1820515, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjA1MTU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1820515?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum", "html_url": "https://github.com/bblum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bblum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1189/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/1189/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
