It uses `GetModuleHandleW` to find the module to pass to `GetProcAddress` when it should instead be using `LoadLibraryW`. Using `GetModuleHandleW` assumes the module has already been loaded by the calling process. That may be a safe bet for certain functions that you want to \u201cdelay load\u201d but certainly not all. `LoadLibraryW` will just go the extra mile of also loading the module if it has not already been loaded. There's also no need to call `FreeLibrary` for such APIs so it should be a pretty simple fix.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/78444/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/78444/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
