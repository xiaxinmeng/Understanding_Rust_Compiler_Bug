One way that we could help out would be to randomize the order of struct fields by default when compiling in debug mode. This would only apply to structs that are not tagged with a `#repr`, and would effectively act as the `#[repr(random)]` proposed by @petrochenkov at https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37429#issuecomment-260080723 (actually adding explicit `#[repr(random)]` would probably require an RFC, and so is not a prereq for this issue).
