"Hello,\n\nI was recently reading about the 0.2 release of Rust, and it looks really interesting!  One thing that bugged me that I wanted to bring up - I'm not a fan of the \"crust\" keyword.  The word \"crust\" has an intrinsic meaning in English, and my brain insists on reading it incorrectly at first read.  I'd like to suggest changing it to \"externc\", which mimics C's `extern \"C\"`, and also doesn't have any other intrinsic meaning.\n\nThanks!\n", "closed_by": {"login": "brson", "id": 147214, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson", "html_url": "https://github.com/brson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2082/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/2082/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
