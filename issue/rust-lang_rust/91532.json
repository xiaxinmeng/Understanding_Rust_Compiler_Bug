Its absence causes Rust to choose the `Clone` implementation on shared references, so the type of `boards` here is actually `&Vec<Board>`; this can be verified by adding an explicit type annotation to the let-bound `boards`.\r\n\r\nThe `help` is not helpful.\r\n\r\nIt would be much nicer if Rust could somehow point out the missing `Clone` implementation. Perhaps it should be suspicious of missing mutability and a uselessly cloned shared reference?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/91532/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/91532/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
