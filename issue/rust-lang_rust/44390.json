This means that we construct the `DepGraph` long before we have enough information to know where to load the previous `DepGraph` from and, because the `CrateStore` is used very early too, we are registering dep-nodes and edges before the graph is fully operational. This is ugly but harmless in the current implementation. In the new tracking system it would become a problem.\r\n\r\nSo the plan is to construct the `DepGraph` only when we can already load the previous `DepGraph`. This needs some refactoring:\r\n- [x] Remove the `dep_graph` field from `Session`, - #44502\r\n- [x] Remove the `dep_graph` field from `CStore` and don't do any dependency tracking in the regular `CStore` implementation. - #44418\r\n- [x] Make sure that we *do* perform dependency tracking for anything within the query system, via a tasteful blend of: - #44142 and #44420\r\n  - [x] creating a `CrateStore` wrapper that does dependency tracking and make only that available via `tcx.cstore()`, and - #44142\r\n  - [x] making all `CrateStore` access go through queries. - #44142\r\n- [x] Adapt `librustc_incremental::persist::fs::prepare_session_directory()` to not need the `tcx` and invoke it [right after parsing, when we know the definitive crate name](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/d7d75eff30ff03f607ff0656a50f4be768cfdbc9/src/librustc_driver/driver.rs#L142). - #44502\r\n- [x] Move `DepGraph` construction to right after `librustc_incremental::persist::fs::prepare_session_directory()` has been called. - #44502\r\n\r\nAny work in this direction will want to be based on top of ~~https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/44341~~ the master branch.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44390/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/44390/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
