We have `TyKind::Infer`, `GenericArg::Infer`, and `ArrayLen::Infer`. It would be too easy for someone to check only for a `TyKind::Infer` generic arg but forget about `GenericArg::Infer`, or check both of those but forget about `ArrayLen::Infer`.\r\n\r\nAt this moment I'm not entirely sure what the best way of fixing this is. rust-lang/compiler-team#480 was an attempt to fix this but it was too broad (attempted to also support unbraced const param arguments), did not solve `ArrayLen::Infer`, and I'm not even sure how nice removing `TyKind::Infer` would be since we use `hir::Ty` in places for things that arent generic args.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @BoxyUwU in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85077#issuecomment-1568887865_\r\n            ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/112110/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/112110/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
