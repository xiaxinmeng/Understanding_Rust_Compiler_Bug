I checked using good old printf debugging, and the segfault is caused by the loop continuing to execute even though the condition here: https://github.com/MarkJr94/bzip2rs/blob/master/bzip2.rs#L180 is no longer true. Notably, an explicit `break;` statement, located here: https://github.com/MarkJr94/bzip2rs/blob/master/bzip2.rs#L207-L210 did not fix the issue.\n\nThe data I am compressing is the file itself, which you can see in the main function here: https://github.com/MarkJr94/bzip2rs/blob/master/bzip2.rs#L481-L502\n\nWhen I perform `rustc --bin bzip2.rs && ./bzip2` I get a segmentation fault.\n\nI tracked down the error with some help from the lovely folks on IRC, and noticed if I changed this line: https://github.com/MarkJr94/bzip2rs/blob/master/bzip2.rs#L193\nfrom `return fail!();` to `fail!();` the code worked as expected. Simply commenting out  this entire block https://github.com/MarkJr94/bzip2rs/blob/master/bzip2.rs#L191-L194 also makes things work. The issue seems to be with the `return fail!();` and I was told on IRC to file this issue, as it seems seperate from https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/6675.\n\nI am continuing to work on isolating the issue.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "emberian", "id": 704250, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDI1MA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/704250?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian", "html_url": "https://github.com/emberian", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emberian/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7714/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/7714/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
