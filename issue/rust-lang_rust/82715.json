This is possible with regular tests marked `#[ignore]` by passing `-- --ignored` to `cargo test`, but the same does not work with documentation tests. Either an argument to run `no_run` doctests should be added, or the rustdoc book should be updated with a more appropriate use-case for `no_run`. The latter is probably a better solution for now, given that adding such a flag would likely be difficult.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82715/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82715/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
