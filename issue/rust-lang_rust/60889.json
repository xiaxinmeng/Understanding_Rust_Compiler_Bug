The problem remains with aggregate fields, however, e.g.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn gen() {\r\n  let x: (i32, i32);\r\n  x.0 = 5;\r\n  yield;\r\n  dbg!(x.0);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case `x.1` is never initialized. This still presents a special case, because we cannot have a partially-unitialized field in a regular struct or enum type.\r\n\r\nOne way to remove the special-casing in miri is to wrap the type of every generator field in `MaybeUninitialized` when we return it from [`rustc::ty::layout::field()`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1962adea6ad9b992516ae56ad7f8c5bc33b951cb/src/librustc/ty/layout.rs#L1723). This required making `MaybeUnitialized` a lang item, though, and doesn't actually give us any new features.\r\n\r\nEventually, I think we'd like to handle aggregate fields explicitly, so we can sanitize UB in generators.", "closed_by": {"login": "tmandry", "id": 2280544, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIyODA1NDQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2280544?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry", "html_url": "https://github.com/tmandry", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tmandry/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60889/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/60889/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
