"First of all, trying to `include!` inner attributes _should be an error_, I think, reading between the lines of [`std::include`'s documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/macro.include.html) and [the Reference on modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/modules.html). Correct me if I am wrong. I initially did not know this but `std::include` may only include expressions and items (according to the documentation) and inner attributes are not items (according to the Reference).\r\n\r\nNow, given the following code in file `it.rs`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ninclude!(\"attrs.rs\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the code below in file `attrs.rs`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#![deny(rust_2018_idioms)]\r\n#![deny(unused_must_use)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current output of `rustc it.rs --crate-type=lib` is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: an inner attribute is not permitted in this context\r\n --> attrs.rs:1:1\r\n  |\r\n1 | #![deny(rust_2018_idioms)]\r\n  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  |\r\n  = note: inner attributes, like `#![no_std]`, annotate the item enclosing them, and are usually found at the beginning of source files\r\n  = note: outer attributes, like `#[test]`, annotate the item following them\r\n\r\nerror: an inner attribute is not permitted following an outer attribute\r\n --> attrs.rs:2:1\r\n  |\r\n1 | #![deny(rust_2018_idioms)]\r\n  | -------------------------- previous outer attribute\r\n2 | #![deny(unused_must_use)]\r\n  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ not permitted following an outer attribute\r\n  |\r\n  = note: inner attributes, like `#![no_std]`, annotate the item enclosing them, and are usually found at the beginning of source files\r\n  = note: outer attributes, like `#[test]`, annotate the item following them\r\n\r\nerror: expected item after attributes\r\n --> attrs.rs:2:1\r\n  |\r\n1 | #![deny(rust_2018_idioms)]\r\n  | -------------------------- other attributes here\r\n2 | #![deny(unused_must_use)]\r\n  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\nerror: aborting due to 3 previous errors\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* _error: an inner attribute is not permitted following an **outer** attribute_ &nbsp;and&nbsp; _previous **outer** attribute_\r\n  * the compiler **incorrectly** labels the *inner* attribute as an *outer* attribute \r\n  * this diagnostic should not be emitted at all\r\n* _error: an inner attribute is not permitted in this context_\r\n  * this diagnostic is **generally fine**\r\n  * however, I'd like to see an explanation or additional context (heh) like a `note` saying that they can't be `include!`d\r\n* _note: inner attributes, like `#![no_std]`, annotate the item enclosing them, and are usually found at the beginning of source files_ &nbsp;and&nbsp;\r\n  _note: outer attributes, like `#[test]`, annotate the item following them_\r\n  * irrelevant advice, does not help here\r\n  * the _found at the beginning of source files_ part is **confusing** since both inner attributes are in fact at the beginning of the source file `attrs.rs`\r\n* _error: expected item after attributes_\r\n  * ~~this **confusing**/**incorrect**: those are *inner* attributes, no item needs to follow~~\r\n  * this should not be emitted at all\r\n  * **update**: ~~This diagnostic is fine~~, I just read it the wrong way. It just means that an item was expected but not found and along the way, some (outer _or inner_) attributes were found. It doesn't necessarily mean that those attributes need an item / need to be ascribed to an item\n  * **update 2**: still, it shouldn't be emitted at all if there are only inner attributes since it's allowed to include an empty file as a declaration and our case is basically 2 invalid inner attributes which should be ignored (because errors are going to reported from some other part of the code base) following by `<eof>` which in this case should be allowed\r\n\r\nrustc 1.60.0-nightly (5d8767cb2 2022-02-12)\r\n\r\n@rustbot modify labels: +C-bug +D-incorrect +D-confusing\r\n\r\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_START -->\r\n\r\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_START -->\r\n\r\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_START$${\"user\":\"fmease\"}$$TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_DATA_END -->\r\n\r\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_ASSIGN_END -->\r\n<!-- TRIAGEBOT_END -->", "closed_by": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94340/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/94340/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
