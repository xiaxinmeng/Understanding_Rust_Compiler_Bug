I used the same name in the tree call-execution methods, \"execution\". The current Rust compiler passed all of them without a single warning sign.\n\nSo which one the current Rust compiler will infer from these 3 calls at run time?\nWhen my code has all the closures, Fn*, and when \"execute\" used a self-defined function as argument, Rust system at run time used:\n\n-) The execution function defined by FnOnce, ( I expected actually the one defined by Fn.)\n\nI kept only Fn and FnMut in the code ( I removed any thing related to FnOnce ) , when \"execute\" used a self-defined function as argument, Rust system at run time used in this case:\n\n-) The execution function defined by Fn.\n\nAny interpretation of this behavior?\n\nMore details about my questions are in http://efaysal.github.io/Rust/RustF2f.html & https://github.com/efaysal/Rustf2F/\n", "closed_by": {"login": "steveklabnik", "id": 27786, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27786?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33521/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/33521/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
