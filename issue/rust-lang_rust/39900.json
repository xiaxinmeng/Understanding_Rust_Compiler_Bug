And every program built with rustc had a similar performance impact (build time for cargo raise by a factor of 8).\r\n\r\nI passed lot of time to found the issue (comparing source tree between stock LLVM-3.9.1 and `src/llvm`, reviewing cmake options and finally comparing compiler command-line). It appeared that LLVM embedded version is build without optimization (no `-O2` in `CFLAGS`).\r\n\r\nAs workaround, I removed the filter out of `-O` options from [bootstrap code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/bootstrap/lib.rs#L821), and the build time come back to something more coherent: only 4h (with 2h for LLVM itself - so it is similar to what we had before).\r\n\r\nIn order to check the LLVM comand-line at compilation, I also added `cfg.define(\"CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE\", \"ON\");` to `src/bootstrap/native.rs`.\r\n\r\nI dunno if the issue is only on OpenBSD or could be found on other platform. Maybe Linux adds some optimization by default on the compiler ? or it is LLVM that doesn't enable same optimizations set depending the platform ?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39900/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/39900/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
