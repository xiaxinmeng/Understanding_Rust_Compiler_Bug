In that\r\ncase, you can use use `issue = \"none\"` in your initial implementation PR. The\r\nreviewer will ask you to open a tracking issue if they agree your feature can be\r\nadded without an RFC.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFeature gate: `#![feature(slice_to_boxed)]`\r\n\r\nThis is a tracking issue for copying/cloning slices into boxed slices.\r\n\r\nThe current recommended approach for turning a `&[T] where T: Clone` into a `Box<[T]>` seems to be to use `.to_vec().into_boxed_slice()`. This misses some opportunities for optimization, since the `Vec` is allocated with a known length. A Godbolt comparison shows that `Vec::into_boxed_slice()` emits unnecessary calls to `realloc()` and `free()` and uses some extra registers for local variables: https://godbolt.org/z/eq7Pc7.\r\n\r\nThere is currently an `impl<T: Copy> From<&[T]> for Box<[T]>`, but not for `T: Clone` like there is for `Vec<T>`.\r\n\r\nWe propose adding a function on slices to clone/copy them into boxed slices and relaxing the `From<&[T]>` bound to `T: Clone` for `Box<[T]>`.  Both of these should be specialized to a `memcpy()` for the common case of `T: Copy`. This `impl` bound change would be insta-stable, so it should be delayed until we are ready to stabilize the rest of this feature.\r\n\r\n### Public API\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor most library features, it'd be useful to include a summarized version of the public API.\r\n(E.g. just the public function signatures without their doc comments or implementation.)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl<T: Clone> [T] {\r\n  pub fn to_boxed_slice(&self) -> Box<Self>;\r\n  pub fn to_boxed_slice_in<A: Allocator>(&self, alloc: A) -> Box<Self, A>;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Bounds relaxed from T: Copy\r\nimpl<T: Clone> From<&[T]> for Box<[T]> { /* ... */ }\r\n\r\n// Bounds relaxed from T: Copy\r\nimpl<T: Clone> From<Cow<'_, [T]>> for Box<[T]> { /* ... */ }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps / History\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor larger features, more steps might be involved.\r\nIf the feature is changed later, please add those PRs here as well.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Implementation of new functions to clone/copy slices into boxed slices: #80460\r\n- [ ] Replacing `T: Copy` bounds with `T: Copy` on `Box<[T]>`'s `From<&[T]>` and `From<Cow<'_, [T]>>` implementations\r\n- [ ] Final commenting period (FCP)\r\n- [ ] Stabilization PR\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nOnce the feature has gone through a few release cycles and there are no\r\nunresolved questions left, the feature might be ready for stabilization.\r\n\r\nIf this feature didn't go through the RFC process, a final commenting period\r\n(FCP) is always needed before stabilization. This works as follows:\r\n\r\nA library team member can kick off the stabilization process, at which point\r\nthe rfcbot will ask all the team members to verify they agree with\r\nstabilization. Once enough members agree and there are no concerns, the final\r\ncommenting period begins: this issue will be marked as such and will be listed\r\nin the next This Week in Rust newsletter. If no blocking concerns are raised in\r\nthat period of 10 days, a stabilzation PR can be opened by anyone.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nInclude any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be\r\nstabilised. If multiple (unrelated) big questions come up, it can be a good idea\r\nto open a separate issue for each, to make it easier to keep track of the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to link any relevant discussions and conclusions (whether on GitHub,\r\nZulip, or the internals forum) here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- None yet.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "yaahc", "id": 1993852, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTM4NTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1993852?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yaahc", "html_url": "https://github.com/yaahc", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yaahc/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yaahc/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yaahc/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yaahc/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yaahc/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yaahc/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yaahc/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yaahc/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yaahc/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82725/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/82725/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
