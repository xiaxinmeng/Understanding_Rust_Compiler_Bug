There is one other part that needs fixed which is slightly related to this which is how he handles coercion_sites in general the code-generation pass doesn't really handle any complex case but we have all the building blocks to make this robust by reusing the adjustment classes we already use for method resolution so there is a refactor needed to take advantage of that.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @philberty in https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/1129#issuecomment-1105653841_\r\n\r\nsee https://godbolt.org/z/EYdEoETaj", "closed_by": {"login": "bors[bot]", "id": 26634292, "node_id": "MDM6Qm90MjY2MzQyOTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1847?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D", "html_url": "https://github.com/apps/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/received_events", "type": "Bot", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/1146/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/1146/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
