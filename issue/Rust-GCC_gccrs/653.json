I'm very pleased with what you guys are doing here, and deeply appreciative to see a fully independent alternative implementation, in GCC no less.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering, are you going to provide an -fno-strict-aliasing option? I strongly hope so. rustc, as you probably know, does not provide such an option, and I keep running into situations where I need either that, or a third party trait to accept pointers instead of references, almost daily. I find stacked borrows to be _extremely_ limiting on the kinds of safe abstractions I can design, and if I could at least use them in my own code compiled with -fno-strict-aliasing, I'd be fairly content.\r\n\r\nThanks!", "closed_by": {"login": "Subsentient", "id": 1091969, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTE5Njk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1091969?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Subsentient", "html_url": "https://github.com/Subsentient", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Subsentient/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Subsentient/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Subsentient/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Subsentient/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Subsentient/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Subsentient/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Subsentient/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Subsentient/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Subsentient/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/653/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 1, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/653/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
