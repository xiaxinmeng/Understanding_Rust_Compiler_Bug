crate::mod::child::grandchild)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe need to as part of name-resolution resolve these paths so that we can use this information later on in privacy checking.\r\n\r\n- [x] Add missing NodeId to AST::SimplePath\r\n- [x] Add missing NodeId to AST::SimplePathSegment\r\n- [x] Add helper to AST::Visibility has_path() return ! path.is_error()\r\n- [x] Add new helper to Resolver::ResolverBase to resolve visibility which takes the reference to the AST::Visibility\r\n- [x] In the visibility resolver we need to resolve the path if the visibility has a path\r\n- [x] Call this visibility_resolver for every vis_item during name_resolution in the 2nd pass not the top-level pass\r\n\r\n### Assumption\r\n\r\nLet s assume for now the Simple Path does not support generics which will simplify this a lot.\r\n\r\n### Resolving Simple Path\r\n\r\nWe need to build a CanonicalPath for this we should be able to reuse the existing code in https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/4337aea3be387921ee60520d2188906d8762367b/gcc/rust/resolve/rust-ast-resolve-expr.h#L28\r\n\r\nLets add a new:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstatic void go (AST::SimplePath *expr, NodeId parent);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore you can build the canonical path you need a new helper to resolve a SimplePathSegment to a CanonicalPath segment\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/4337aea3be387921ee60520d2188906d8762367b/gcc/rust/resolve/rust-ast-resolve-type.h#L154\r\n\r\nYou need a new helper for SimplePathSegment which will be the same as the PathExprSegment except it can ignore generics and it just needs the string of the segment and its relevant node_id.\r\n\r\nNow that you have this in place you can build the full path by creating a new resolve_simple_path_segments by reusing the code from:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/4337aea3be387921ee60520d2188906d8762367b/gcc/rust/resolve/rust-ast-resolve.cc#L567\r\n\r\nThe only difference really is the different types but a SimplePath should be fully resolved at name-resolution time so the piece in the resolve_segments for PathExprSegments should not allow for that empty else case but be an error condition.\r\n",
