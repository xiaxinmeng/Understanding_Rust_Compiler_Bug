That's relatively easier for coding, since there's pattern matching, and there're fewer side-effects (or even no) so that the optimizing is pretty easy: find the correct pattern, and inline the function or closure, then execute the rewriting rules. This process can cover many common optimizing, say, constant-fold, dead-variable-elimination, and dead-function-elimination, etc. For Rust, I think they're doing similar rewriting, but I need more researches.\r\n\r\nThe Rust compiler is written in Rust, so there's pattern matching. I guess we have to write more code for the tree node matching. After all, pattern matching is just syntax sugar, which expands more code that we have to write in C++.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we can follow the exact design of HIR and MIR, since C++ may not be possible to cover the expressiveness exactly so that it's better to design a similar IR for taking advantage of C++ features.  I'm just guessing, and I need more researches for the conclusion.\r\n\r\nSo I think the plan could be:\r\n- Implementing HIR according to Rust's design\r\n- Type-checking in HIR\r\n- Implementing MIR\r\n- HIR->MIR\r\n- Borrow-checking\r\n- Other pre-optimizing\r\n- MIR->GENERIC\r\n\r\nThat's a rough plan, there're more things, including memory management, library interfaces, exceptions handling, etc. But I'm not sure where to put them in the pipeline. So I just listed them.\r\n\r\nComments?\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "philberty", "id": 84585, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg0NTg1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84585?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty", "html_url": "https://github.com/philberty", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/11/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/11/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
