This milestone should be focused on compiling libcore in the hope to distribute it in GCC for the 13.2 release. Importantly, this is different from supporting libcore 1.49: libcore needs certain features to compile, such as for loops or inline assembly (as it uses some in a decimal to float algorithm), so to first compile libcore we must implement these features. A second milestone targets what libcore offers, such as all of the compiler intrinsic functions.", "creator": {"login": "CohenArthur", "id": 43524065, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQzNTI0MDY1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43524065?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur", "html_url": "https://github.com/CohenArthur", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 17, "closed_issues": 9, "state": "open", "created_at": "2023-04-13T08:14:54Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-19T08:31:03Z", "due_on": "2023-07-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": null}, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-06-15T14:11:10Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-19T08:31:03Z", "closed_at": "2023-06-19T08:31:02Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "The compiler fails to build with the adress sanitizer enabled, since our lexer reads a pointer which might be null.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/master/gcc/rust/lex/rust-lex.cc#L258-L261\r\n\r\nThe condition and variable declaration needs to be switched.
