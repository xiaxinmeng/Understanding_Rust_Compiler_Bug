Type Check\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Type system is performing Type Inferencing and Type checking all at once but we can use this code as a way to bootstrap the type inferencing pass including the fallbacks of inference variables/never types.\r\n\r\nIn theory, the existing code should be fine but we need to remove the code that does type checking and we need to implement type coercion rules properly. https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/type-coercions.html\r\n\r\nThen we can leave a stub trait solver pass to be filled out as part of the work into traits.\r\n\r\nFinally we perform a full type check pass to ensure all types are compatible or emit relevant errors at the end.", "closed_by": {"login": "bors[bot]", "id": 26634292, "node_id": "MDM6Qm90MjY2MzQyOTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1847?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D", "html_url": "https://github.com/apps/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/received_events", "type": "Bot", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/395/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/395/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
