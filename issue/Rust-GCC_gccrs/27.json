Here're the steps:\r\n\r\n1. Create `Resolution` class inherited from `AST::ASTVisitor`, and move `static bool ResolveNamesAndTypes` into it.\r\n2. Separate `TypeResolution` and `NameResolution` class inherited from `Resolution` class.\r\n3. Put them in different files.\r\n\r\nThis is better for maintenance and working parallelly.\r\nAnd the name resolution will distinct names from different namespaces, like values, macros, so it's an important prerequisite for the rest of the work.\r\n\r\nIf it's OK, then I can raise PR for it.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? @philberty @SimplyTheOther \r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "philberty", "id": 84585, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg0NTg1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84585?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty", "html_url": "https://github.com/philberty", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philberty/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/27/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/27/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
