This would be similar to something like\r\n```rust\r\nfn not_void() -> i32 {\r\n    8\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    not_void();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhere discarding the return value of a function is fine, unless said function or type is marked with `#[must_use]`.\r\n\r\nHowever, gccrs does not seem to be able to discard the value of an expression (and thus transforming said expression into a \"statement\"). Therefore, the snippets of code above fail with the following error:\r\n```sh\r\n/tmp/main.rs:1:1: error: expected [()] got [<integer>] # or `got [i32]` if we use the `not_void()` function\r\n    1 | fn main() {\r\n      | ^\r\n```\r\n\r\nI haven't found any issues about the subject, but might not have looked hard enough!
