I was actually wondering whether some of the ported-but-not-renamed functions in this PR will give link errors if we try to build a gcc with both the rust and c++ frontends enabled. Definitely not a blocker for this to be merged!\r\n> \r\n> It might turn out that if we want to link against the C++ const folder directly we'd need to factor it out of the C++ frontend to somewhere common, like how C and C++ share some functionality in the c-family directory. I'm not very familiar with the build processes for the front ends though so maybe these are issues long since solved :P I need to read up.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/1334/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/1334/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
