They do not \"declare\" a type, but they *use* one (`const N: usize`). So they should only be typechecked when items are typechecked. This should be the first change, as generic parameters for items are not used after the `TypeCheckTopLevel` resolver phase (in functions for example).\r\n\r\nAfterwards, once we are sure that the type they reference exists and has been declared, we must check that it is a valid \"const generic type\" (#1303)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/1351/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/1351/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
