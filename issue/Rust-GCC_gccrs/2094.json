codes.\r\n\r\nMain:\r\n- [ ] E0005 (Patterns used to bind names must be irrefutable)\r\n- [ ] E0023 (A pattern attempted to extract an incorrect number of fields from a variant)\r\n- [ ] E0025 (Each field of a struct can only be bound once in a pattern)\r\n- [ ] E0026 (A struct pattern attempted to extract a non-existent field from a struct)\r\n- [ ] E0027 (A pattern for a struct fails to specify a sub-pattern for every one of the struct's fields)\r\n- [ ] E0029 (Something other than numbers and characters has been used for a range pattern)\r\n- [ ] E0030 (Empty range pattern e.g. `2..=1`)\r\n- [ ] E0170 (A pattern binding is using the same name as one of the variants of a type)\r\n- [x] E0408 (An \"or\" pattern was used where the variable bindings are not consistently bound across patterns)\r\n- [x] E0409 (An \"or\" pattern was used where the variable bindings are not consistently bound across patterns)\r\n- [x] E0415 (More than one function parameter have the same name)\r\n- [x] E0416 (An identifier is bound more than once in a pattern)\r\n- [ ] E0527 (The number of elements in an array or slice pattern differed from the number of elements in the array being matched)\r\n- [ ] E0528 (An array or slice pattern required more elements than were present in the matched array)\r\n- [ ] E0529 (An array or slice pattern was matched against some other type)\r\n- [ ] E0642 (Trait methods currently cannot take patterns as arguments)\r\n- [ ] E0769 (A tuple struct or tuple variant was used in a pattern as if it were a struct or struct variant)\r\n- [ ] E0783 (The range pattern `...` is no longer allowed)\r\n\r\nAdditional:\r\n- [ ] E0004 (Match arms are not exhaustive)\r\n\r\nNot sure:\r\n- [ ] E0130 (A pattern was declared as an argument in a foreign function declaration) (?)\r\n- [ ] E0158 (An associated const, const parameter or static has been referenced in a pattern)\r\n- [ ] E0164 (Something which is neither a tuple struct nor a tuple variant was used in a pattern)\r\n- [ ] E0532 (Pattern arm did not match expected kind of enum variant)\r\n- [ ] E0533 (An item which isn't a unit struct, a variant, nor a constant has been used as a match pattern)\r\n- [ ] E0561 (A non-ident or non-wildcard pattern has been used as a parameter of a function pointer type)\r\n- [ ] E0730 (An array without a fixed length was pattern-matched)\r\n",
