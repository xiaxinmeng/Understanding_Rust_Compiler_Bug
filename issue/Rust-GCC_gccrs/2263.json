all of the issues we'd like to take care of before upstreaming code for the GCC 13.2 release. This milestone should be focused on compiling libcore in the hope to distribute it in GCC for the 13.2 release. Importantly, this is different from supporting libcore 1.49: libcore needs certain features to compile, such as for loops or inline assembly (as it uses some in a decimal to float algorithm), so to first compile libcore we must implement these features. A second milestone targets what libcore offers, such as all of the compiler intrinsic functions.", "creator": {"login": "CohenArthur", "id": 43524065, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQzNTI0MDY1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43524065?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur", "html_url": "https://github.com/CohenArthur", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CohenArthur/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 17, "closed_issues": 9, "state": "open", "created_at": "2023-04-13T08:14:54Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-19T08:31:03Z", "due_on": "2023-07-15T07:00:00Z", "closed_at": null}, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-06-02T13:17:22Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-06T12:47:15Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "              Raise an issue about the whole path to the lang item stuff because there is overlap with what I am doing there too\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @philberty in https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/2256#discussion_r1213319341_\r\n            \r\n            \r\nThis is also present in other species.
