In addition to making sure that GCC is able to reproduce itself bit-by-bit, this also means that stages 2+ are built with `-Werror` (turning most *warning* into *error* diagnostics; see `--enable-werror`, possibly enabled by default).  This helps to catch a good number of bugs, because it enforces that GCC compiles without compiler diagnostics; it's a requirement for upstream patch submission (<https://gcc.gnu.org/contribute.html#testing>).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe GCC/Rust instructions explicitly specify `--disable-bootstrap` (which of course is much faster):\r\n\r\n  - <https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/master/README.md>\r\n  - <https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/master/.github/workflows/ccpp.yml>\r\n  - <https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/master/Dockerfile>\r\n\r\nI think it's OK to keep it that way (I'm also doing that for my day-to-day development), but at least as a background task, we should also make sure that `--enable-bootstrap` works -- which it currently doesn't.  I've produced a number of patches, that I'm going to submit individually.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bors[bot]", "id": 26634292, "node_id": "MDM6Qm90MjY2MzQyOTI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1847?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D", "html_url": "https://github.com/apps/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/received_events", "type": "Bot", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/336/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/336/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}
