https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/55986\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#![feature(fn_traits)] \r\n#![feature(unboxed_closures)]\r\n\r\nstruct Ishmael;\r\nstruct Maybe;\r\nstruct CallMe;\r\n\r\nimpl FnOnce<(Ishmael,)> for CallMe {\r\n    type Output = ();\r\n    extern \"rust-call\" fn call_once(self, _args: (Ishmael,)) -> () {\r\n        println!(\"Split your lungs with blood and thunder!\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl FnOnce<(Maybe,)> for CallMe {\r\n    type Output = ();\r\n    extern \"rust-call\" fn call_once(self, _args: (Maybe,)) -> () {\r\n        println!(\"So we just met, and this is crazy\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    CallMe(Ishmael);\r\n    CallMe(Maybe);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix this in gccrs there are a few things we need to do:\r\n\r\n- [x] refactor MethodResolver::Probe to return a set<candidates> so that we can get multiple candidate errors properly\r\n- [ ] refactor autoderef to take an optional list of arguments which can be used to match function calls against if it is available\r\n- [ ] support looking for call_once implementations on call-expr's like this so that this becomes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet a = CallMe;\r\na.fn_once(args)\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @philberty in https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/195#issuecomment-943338574_\r\n      ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url":
