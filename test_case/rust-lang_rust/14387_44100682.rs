<anon>  (region pointers),
<anon>  usually introduced as (e.g. region pointers)
<anon>  (or some other latin thing)
<anon>  Therefore, the best way to explain how
<anon>  i'd drop Therefore
<anon>
<anon>  point to, instead, they
<anon>  run-on-y
<anon>  point to. Instead, they might be better
<anon>
<anon>  As an example, consider a simple struct type  Point : drop as an example
<anon>  drop many of those phrases
<anon>  im seeing a lot
<anon>  but if you really wan t one, "In the following code" or similar is better
<anon>
<anon>  In order to convert  Box<T>  into a  &T , we need to use  &* .
<anon>  might that be better broken up into the two operations?
<anon>  if it even is
<anon>  I imagine that you would first deference(whatever it is)
<anon>  then take the address of
<anon>  new users might mistakenly think of that as one operation
<anon>  and if it is, then its fine
<anon>
<anon>  the other uses for the & operator section is ehhhhh
<anon>  under borrowing and enums
<anon>  everyone might not know what tau is
<anon>  might want to put it before the code
<anon>
<anon>  if you borrow a structs or boxes to create a reference,
<anon>  that pluralization/possessivation is wrong
