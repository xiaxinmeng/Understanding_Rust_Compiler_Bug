
the size for values of type `(dyn core::error::Error + 'static)` cannot be known at compilation time [E0277] doesn't have a size known at compile-time Help: within `error::Error`, the trait `core::marker::Sized` is not implemented for `(dyn core::error::Error + 'static)` Note: required because it appears within the type `error::Error` Note: required by a bound in `core::convert::From`
