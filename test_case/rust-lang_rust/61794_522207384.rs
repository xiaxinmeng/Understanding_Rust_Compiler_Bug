
If the author has not responded to a previous ping, meaning more than 2 weeks have passed with no 
activity, the PR should be closed with a message thanking the author for their work, asking the them 
to reopen when they have a chance to make the necessary changes, and warning them not to push to 
the PR while it is closed as that prevents it from being reopened. Tag the PR with S-inactive-closed.
