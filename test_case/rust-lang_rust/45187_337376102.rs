PM 022123 <misdreavus> so like, here's how i want it to look:
PM 022139 <misdreavus> make the methods listing look the same as the module-sibling listing that's put there by the javascript
PM 022157 <misdreavus> put that listing at the bottom of the static sidebar, after the table-of-contents headings
PM 022219 <misdreavus> so that it just flows into the other listings that come in later
