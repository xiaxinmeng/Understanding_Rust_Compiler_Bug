    // Currently we try hard to ensure that the call to `.exec()` doesn't
    // actually allocate any memory. While many platforms try to ensure that
    // memory allocation works after a fork in a multithreaded process, it's
    // been observed to be buggy and somewhat unreliable, so we do our best to
    // just not do it at all!
