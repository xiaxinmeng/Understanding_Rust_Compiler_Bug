                      don't mention how to 
                      setup 64-bit msys2
20:50 < WindowsBunny> steveklabnik: We need 
                      to mention 
                      mingw64_shell and the 
                      x86_64 toolchain

20:51 < WindowsBunny> steveklabnik: As well 
                      as pointing out that 
                      whether you install 
                      the 32-bit or 64-bit 
                      msys2 you'll have 
                      access to both 
                      toolchains (unless 
                      your computer only 
                      allows 32-bit)
