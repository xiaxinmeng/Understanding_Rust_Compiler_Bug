fatal: Unable to create '/Users/rustbuild/src/rust-buildbot/slave/auto-mac-64-opt-rustbuild/build/.git/modules/src/llvm/index.lock': File exists.

If no other git process is currently running, this probably means a
git process crashed in this repository earlier. Make sure no other git
process is running and remove the file manually to continue.
