\n\nSince our new thread runs in parallel, the stack frame containing `x` and `y`\nmay well have disappeared by the time we try to use them. Even if we call\n`thr.join()` within foo (which blocks until `thr` has completed, ensuring the\nstack frame won't disappear), we will not succeed: the compiler cannot prove\nthat this behaviour is safe, and so won't let us do it.\n\nThe solution to this problem is usually to switch to using a `move` closure.\nThis approach moves (or copies, where possible) data into the closure, rather\nthan taking references to it.
