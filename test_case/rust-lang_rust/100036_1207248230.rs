        Generate stack canaries in a function if it either:
        - has a local variable of `[T; N]` type, regardless of `T` and `N`
        - takes the address of a local variable.

          (Note that a local variable being borrowed is not equivalent to its
          address being taken: e.g. some borrows may be removed by optimization,
          while by-value argument passing may be implemented with reference to a
          local stack variable in the ABI.)
