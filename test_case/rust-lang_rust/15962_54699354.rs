    // We also bind a single value, sp, to ext_cx.call_site()
    //
    // This causes every span in a token-tree quote to be attributed to the
    // call site of the extension using the quote. We can't really do much
    // better since the source of the quote may well be in a library that
    // was not even parsed by this compilation run, that the user has no
    // source code for (eg. in libsyntax, which they're just _using_).
    //
    // The old quasiquoter had an elaborate mechanism for denoting input
    // file locations from which quotes originated; unfortunately this
    // relied on feeding the source string of the quote back into the
    // compiler (which we don't really want to do) and, in any case, only
    // pushed the problem a very small step further back: an error
    // resulting from a parse of the resulting quote is still attributed to
    // the site the string literal occurred, which was in a source file
    // _other_ than the one the user has control over. For example, an
    // error in a quote from the protocol compiler, invoked in user code
    // using macro_rules! for example, will be attributed to the macro_rules.rs
    // file in libsyntax, which the user might not even have source to (unless
    // they happen to have a compiler on hand). Over all, the phase distinction
    // just makes quotes "hard to attribute". Possibly this could be fixed
    // by recreating some of the original qq machinery in the tt regime
    // (pushing fake FileMaps onto the parser to account for original sites
    // of quotes, for example) but at this point it seems not likely to be
    // worth the hassle.
