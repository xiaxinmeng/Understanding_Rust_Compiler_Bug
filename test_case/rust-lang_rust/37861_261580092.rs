/// Note that this does not inline call sites marked as always_inline and does
/// not delete the functions even when all users are inlined. The normal
/// inliner should be used to handle call site inlining, this pass's goal is to
/// be the simplest possible pass to remove always_inline function definitions'
/// uses by inlining them. The \c GlobalDCE pass can be used to remove these
/// functions once all users are gone.
