
Expected a gate test for the feature 'type_ascription'.
Hint: create a file named 'feature-gate-type_ascription.rs' in the compile-fail
      test suite, with its failures due to missing usage of
      #![feature(type_ascription)].
Hint: If you already have such a test and don't want to rename it,
      you can also add a // gate-test-type_ascription line to the test file.
Found 1 features without a gate test.
