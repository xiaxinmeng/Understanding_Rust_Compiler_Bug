[00:02:56] tidy error: Found 1 features without a gate test.
[00:02:56] Hint: create a file named 'feature-gate-irrefutable_let_pattern.rs' in the compile-fail
[00:02:56]       test suite, with its failures due to missing usage of
[00:02:56]       #![feature(irrefutable_let_pattern)].
[00:02:56] Hint: If you already have such a test and don't want to rename it,
[00:02:56]       you can also add a // gate-test-irrefutable_let_pattern line to the test file.
[00:02:56] tidy error: The Unstable Book has a 'language feature' section 'allow_irrefutable_lets' which doesn't correspond to an unstable language feature
[00:02:56] some tidy checks failed
