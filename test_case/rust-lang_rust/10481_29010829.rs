-fwrapv
    This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic overflow of addition, subtraction and 
multiplication wraps around using twos-complement representation. This flag enables some optimizations and 
disables others. This option is enabled by default for the Java front end, as required by the Java language 
specification.
