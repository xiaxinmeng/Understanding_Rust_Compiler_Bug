\n\nIn this example, `value` is mutably borrowed by `borrow` and cannot be\nused to calculate `sum`. This is not possible because this would violate\nRust's mutability rules.\n\nYou can fix this error by limiting the scope of thebyte_start":4343,"byte_end":4344,"line_start":146,"line_end":146,"column_start":18,"column_end":19,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"            &[_, x, .., _, _] => println!(\"{}\", x),","highlight_start":18,"highlight_end":19}],"label":"use of borrowed `v`","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"/checkout/src/test/ui/borrowck/borrowck-describe-lvalue.rs","byte_start":5227,"byte_end":5228,"line_start":163,"line_end":163,"column_start":14,"column_end":15,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"        drop(x);","highlight_start":14,"highlight_end":15}],"label":"borrow used here, in later iteration of loop","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":"error[E0503]: cannot use `v[..]` because it was mutably borrowed\n  --> /checkout/src/test/ui/borrowck/borrowck-describe-lvalue.rs:146:18\n   |\nLL |         let x = &mut v;\n   |                 ------ borrow of `v` occurs here\n...\nLL |             &[_, x, .., _, _] => println!(\"{}\", x),\n   |                  ^ use of borrowed `v`\n...\nLL |         drop(x);\n   |              - borrow used here, in later iteration of loop\n\n"}
