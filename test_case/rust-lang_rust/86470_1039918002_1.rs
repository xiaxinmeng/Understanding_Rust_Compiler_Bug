
CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW (since Linux 2.6.28; Linux-specific)
              Similar to CLOCK_MONOTONIC, but provides access to a raw
              hardware-based time that is not subject to NTP adjustments
              or the incremental adjustments performed by adjtime(3).
              This clock does not count time that the system is
              suspended.
