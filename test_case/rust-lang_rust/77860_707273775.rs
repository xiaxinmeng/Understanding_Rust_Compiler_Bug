error: rustc-dev-guide maintainer @mark-i-m is not assignable in the rust-lang/rust repo

  To be assignable, a person needs to be explicitly listed as a
  collaborator in the repository settings. The simple way to
  fix this is to ask someone with 'admin' privileges on the repo
  to add the person or whole team as a collaborator with 'read'
  privileges. Those privileges don't grant any extra permissions
  so it's safe to apply them.

The build will fail due to this.
