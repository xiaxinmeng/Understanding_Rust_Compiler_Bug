
tidy error: Found 1 features without a gate test.
Expected a gate test for the feature 'custom_code_classes_in_docs'.
Hint: create a failing test file named 'feature-gate-custom_code_classes_in_docs.rs'
      in the 'ui' test suite, with its failures due to
      missing usage of `#![feature(custom_code_classes_in_docs)]`.
Hint: If you already have such a test and don't want to rename it,
      you can also add a // gate-test-custom_code_classes_in_docs line to the test file.
