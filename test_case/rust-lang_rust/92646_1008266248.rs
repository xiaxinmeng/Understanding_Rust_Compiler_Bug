This error was generated by the lint-docs tool.
This tool extracts documentation for lints from the source code and places
them in the rustc book. See the declare_lint! documentation
https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint_defs/macro.declare_lint.html


To re-run these tests, run: ./x.py test --keep-stage=0 src/tools/lint-docs
The --keep-stage flag should be used if you have already built the compiler
