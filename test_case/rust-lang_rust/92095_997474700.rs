
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 2 and 13 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)

hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint: 
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge (the default strategy)
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
