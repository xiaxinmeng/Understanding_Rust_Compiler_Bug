                 Specifies that the linker should link the files listed in
                 file.  This is an alternative to listing the files on the com-
                 mand line.  The file names are listed one per line separated
                 only by newlines. (Spaces and tabs are assumed to be part of
                 the file name.)  If the optional directory name, dirname is
                 specified, it is prepended to each name in the list file.
