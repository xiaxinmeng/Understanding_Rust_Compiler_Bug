\n\nWhenever a temporary is created, it is automatically dropped (freed)\naccording to fixed rules. Ordinarily, the temporary is dropped\nat the end of the enclosing statement -- in this case, after the `let`.\nThis is illustrated in the example above by showing that `tmp` would\nbe freed as we exit the block.\n\nTo fix this problem, you need to create a local variable\nto store the value in rather than relying on a te_start":65,"line_end":65,"column_start":41,"column_end":54,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    let _: Vec<&'static String> = vec![&String::new()];","highlight_start":41,"highlight_end":54}],"label":"creates a temporary which is freed while still in use","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"/checkout/src/test/ui/nll/user-annotations/patterns.rs","byte_start":1290,"byte_end":1291,"line_start":65,"line_end":65,"column_start":55,"column_end":56,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"    let _: Vec<&'static String> = vec![&String::new()];","highlight_start":55,"highlight_end":56}],"label":"temporary value is freed at the end of this statement","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"/checkout/src/test/ui/nll/user-annotations/patterns.rs","byte_start":1247,"byte_end":1267,"line_start":65,"line_end":65,"column_start":12,"column_end":32,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"    let _: Vec<&'static String> = vec![&String::new()];","highlight_start":12,"highlight_end":32}],"label":"type annotation requires that borrow lasts for `'static`","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":"error[E0716]: temporary value dropped while borrowed\n  --> /checkout/src/test/ui/nll/user-annotations/patterns.rs:65:41\n   |\nLL |     let _: Vec<&'static String> = vec![&String::new()];\n   |            --------------------         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ - temporary value is freed at the end of this statement\n   |            |                            |\n   |            |                       lue = foo(); // dropped at the end of the enclosing block\nlet p = bar(&value);\nlet q = *p;\n
