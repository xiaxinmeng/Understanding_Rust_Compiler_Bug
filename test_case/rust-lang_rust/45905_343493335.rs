[00:03:55] Expected a gate test for the feature 'wasm_import_memory'.
[00:03:55] Hint: create a file named 'feature-gate-wasm_import_memory.rs' in the compile-fail
[00:03:55]       test suite, with its failures due to missing usage of
[00:03:55]       #![feature(wasm_import_memory)].
[00:03:55] Hint: If you already have such a test and don't want to rename it,
[00:03:55]       you can also add a // gate-test-wasm_import_memory line to the test file.
[00:03:55] tidy error: Found 1 features without a gate test.
[00:03:56] some tidy checks failed
