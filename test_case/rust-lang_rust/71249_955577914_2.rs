    
The following warnings were discovered during the build. These warnings are an
indication that the packages contain code that will become an error in a
future release of Rust. These warnings typically cover changes to close
soundness problems, unintended or undocumented behavior, or critical problems
that cannot be fixed in a backwards-compatible fashion, and are not expected
to be in wide use.

Each warning should contain a link for more information on what the warning
means and how to resolve it.


To solve this problem, you can try the following approaches:


- Some affected dependencies have newer versions available.
You may want to consider updating them to a newer version to see if the issue has been fixed.

rental v0.5.5 has the following newer versions available: 0.5.6


- If the issue is not solved by updating the dependencies, a fix has to be
implemented by those dependencies. You can help with that by notifying the
maintainers of this problem (e.g. by creating a bug report) or by proposing a
fix to the maintainers (e.g. by creating a pull request):

  - rental:0.5.5
  - Repository: https://github.com/jpernst/rental
  - Detailed warning command: `cargo report future-incompatibilities --id 1 --package rental:0.5.5`

- If waiting for an upstream fix is not an option, you can use the `[patch]`
section in `Cargo.toml` to use your own version of the dependency. For more
information, see:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html#the-patch-section

The package `rental v0.5.5` currently triggers the following future incompatibility lints:
