\n\nA `const` represents a constant value that should never change. If one takes\na `&` reference to the constant, then one is taking a pointer to some memory\nlocation containing the value. Normally this is perfectly fine: most values\ncan't be changed via a shared `&` pointer, but interior mutability would allow\nit. That is, a constant value could be mutated. On the other hand, a `static` is\nexplicitly a single memory location, which can be mutated at will.\n\nSo, in order to solve this error, either use statics which are `Sync`:\n\n
