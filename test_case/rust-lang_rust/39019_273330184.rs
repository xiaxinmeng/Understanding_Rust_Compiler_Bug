   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope; the following traits define an item `Item`, perhaps you need to implement one of them:
   = help: candidate #1: `std::iter::Iterator`
   = help: candidate #2: `std::iter::IntoIterator`
   = help: candidate #3: `std::iter::ZipImpl`
   = help: candidate #4: `core::slice::SliceExt`
