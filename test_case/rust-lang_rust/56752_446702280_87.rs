\n\nThe machine code for `foo::<u8>()`, `foo::<bool>()`, `foo::<String>()`, or any\nother type substitution is different. Hence the compiler generates the\nimplementation on-demand. If you call `foo()` with a `bool` parameter, the\ncompiler will only generate code for `foo::<bool>()`. When we have additional\ntype parameters, the numbecan grow drastically.\n\nTo fix this, it is suggested to use a `where Self: Sized` bound similar to the\nfix for the sub-error above if you do not intend to call the method with type\nparameters:\n\n
