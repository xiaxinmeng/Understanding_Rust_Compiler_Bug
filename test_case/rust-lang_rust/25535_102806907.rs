<Yurume> the truth is that, no one reads the book in the sequential order :)
<Yurume> we need a good index and ToC to faciliate such patterns
<Yurume> the beginner in the question was very confused since there seems to be vectors
         (he/she had C++ background) and slices but not arrays
<Yurume> actually, he/she almost got to the correct chapter, but didn't care to read all of them
         (yeah, we don't even have a *full* ToC, just a partial ToC two levels deep)
