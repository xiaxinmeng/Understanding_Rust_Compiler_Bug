
       In cgroups v2, all mounted controllers reside in a single unified
       hierarchy.  While (different) controllers may be simultaneously
       mounted under the v1 and v2 hierarchies, it is not possible to
       mount the same controller simultaneously under both the v1 and
       the v2 hierarchies.
