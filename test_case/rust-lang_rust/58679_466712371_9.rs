\n\nTo determine if a `T` is `Foo`, we need to check if `Bar<T>` is `Foo`. However,\nto do this check, we need to determine that `Bar<Bar<T>>` is `Foo`. To\ndetermine this, we check if `Bar<Bar<Bar<T>>>` is `Foo`, and so on. This is\nclearly a recursive requirement that can't be resolved directly.\n\nConsider changing your trait bounds so that they're less self-referential.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"/checkout/src/test/ui/issues/issue-23122-2.rs","byte_start":85,"byte_end":89,"line_start":7,"line_end":7,"column_start":15,"column_end":19,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"impl<T: Next> Next for GetNext<T> {","highlight_start":15,"highlight_end":19}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"consider adding a `#![recursion_limit=\"128\"]` attribute to your crate","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null},{"message":"required because of the requirements on the impl of `Next` for `GetNext<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<T as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next>`","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"error[E0275]: overflow evaluating the requirement `<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<T as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next: std::marker::Sized`\n  --> /checkout/src/test/ui/issues/issue-23122-2.rs:7:15\n   |\nLL | impl<T: Next> Next for GetNext<T> {\n   |               ^^^^\n   |\n   = help: consider adding a `#![recursion_limit=\"128\"]` attribute to your crate\n   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `Next` for `GetNext<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<T as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next as Next>::Next>`\n\n"}
