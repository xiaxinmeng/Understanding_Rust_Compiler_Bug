\n\nA trait object is defined over a single, fully-defined trait. With a regular\ndefault parameter, this parameter can just be substituted in. However, if the\ndefault parameter is `Self`, the trait changes for each concrete type; i.e.\n`i32` will be expected to implement `A<i32>`, `bool` will be expected to\nimplement `A<bool>`, etc... These types will not share an implementation of a\nfully-defined trait; instead they share implementations of a trait with\ndifferent parameters substituted in for each implementation. This is\nirreconcilable with what we need to make a trait object work, and is thus\ndisallowed.
