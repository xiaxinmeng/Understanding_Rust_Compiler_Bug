       GREP_OPTIONS
              This variable specifies default options to be placed in front of
              any explicit options.  As  this  causes  problems  when  writing
              portable  scripts,  this  feature  will  be  removed in a future
              release of grep, and grep warns if it is used.   Please  use  an
              alias or script instead.
