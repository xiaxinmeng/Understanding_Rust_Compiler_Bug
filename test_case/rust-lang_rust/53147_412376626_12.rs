\n\nHere, we tried to move a field out of a struct of type `DropStruct` which\nimplements the `Drop` trait. However, a struct cannot be dropped if one or\nmore of its fields have been moved.\n\nStructs implementing the `Drop` trait have an implicit destructor that gets\ncalled when they go out of scope. This destructor may use the fields of the\nstruct, so moving out of the struct could make it impossible to run the\ndestructor. Therefore, we must think of all values whose type implements the\n`Drop` trait as single units whose fields cannot be moved.\n\nThis error can be fixed by creating a reference to the fields of a struct,\nenum, or tuple using the `ref` keyword:\n\n
