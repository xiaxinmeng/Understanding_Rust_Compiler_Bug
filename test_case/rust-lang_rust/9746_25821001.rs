Instead of the poems I had hoped for, there came only a shuddering blackness
and ineffable loneliness; and I saw at last a fearful truth which no one had
ever dared to breathe before — the unwhisperable secret of secrets — The fact
that this city of stone and stridor is not a sentient perpetuation of Old New
York as London is of Old London and Paris of Old Paris, but that it is in fact
quite dead, its sprawling body imperfectly embalmed and infested with queer
animate things which have nothing to do with it as it was in life.
