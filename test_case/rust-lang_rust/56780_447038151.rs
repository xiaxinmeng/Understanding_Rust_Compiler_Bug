
warning: failed to automatically apply fixes suggested by rustc to crate `diesel`

after fixes were automatically applied the compiler reported errors within these files:

  * diesel/src/type_impls/date_and_time.rs

This likely indicates a bug in either rustc or cargo itself,
and we would appreciate a bug report! You're likely to see 
a number of compiler warnings after this message which cargo
attempted to fix but failed. If you could open an issue at
https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues
quoting the full output of this command we'd be very appreciative!
