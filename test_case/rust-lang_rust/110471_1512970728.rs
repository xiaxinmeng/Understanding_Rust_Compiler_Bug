error: you asked `x.py` to setup a new config file, but one already exists at `config.toml`
help: to pick a specific profile, try adding `profile = "..."` at the top of config.toml
note: this will use the configuration in /home/jyn/src/rust2/src/bootstrap/defaults/config.compiler.toml
help: to see a list of available `setup` commands, run `x setup --help --verbose`
