[01:11:31] error: current package believes it's in a workspace when it's not:
[01:11:31] current:   /checkout/src/tools/rls/Cargo.toml
[01:11:31] workspace: /checkout/src/Cargo.toml
[01:11:31] 
[01:11:31] this may be fixable by adding `tools/rls` to the `workspace.members` array of the manifest located at: /checkout/src/Cargo.toml
