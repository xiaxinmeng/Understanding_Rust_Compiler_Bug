\n\nType inference typically proceeds from the top of the function to the bottom,\nfiguring out types as it goes. In some cases -- notably method calls and\noverloadable operators like `*` -- the type checker may not have enough\ninformation *yet* to make progress. This can be true even if the rest of the\nfunction provides enough context (because the type-checker hasn't looked that\nfar ahead yet). In this case, type annotations can be used to help it along.\n\nTo fix this error, just specify the type of the variable. Example:\n\n
