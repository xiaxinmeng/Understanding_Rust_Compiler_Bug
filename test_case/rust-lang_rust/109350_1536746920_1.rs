\n\nThis error indicates that type inference did not result in one unique possible\ntype, and extra information is required. In most cases this can be provided\nby adding a type annotation. Sometimes you need to specify a generic type\nparameter manually.\n\nA common example is the `collect` method on `Iterator`. It has a generic type\nparameter with a `FromIterator` bound, which for a `char` iterator is\nimplemented by `Vec` and `String` among others. Consider the following snippet\nthat reverses the characters of a string:\n\nIn the first code example, the compiler cannot infer what the type of `x` should\nbe: `Vec<char>` and `String` are both suitable candidates. To specify which type\nto use, you can use a type annotation on `x`:\n\n
