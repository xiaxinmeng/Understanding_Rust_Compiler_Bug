By contrast,\n+the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n+share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n+software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n+GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n+any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\n+your programs, too.\n+\n+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n+them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n+want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n+free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n+\n+  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n+these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n+certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n+you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n+\n+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n+gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n+freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\n+or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\n+know their rights.\n+\n+  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n+(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n+giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n+\n+  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n+that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n+authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n+changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n+authors of previous versions.\n+\n+  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n+modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n+can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n+protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\n+pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n+use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\n+have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n+products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n+stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n+of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n+\n+  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n+States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n+software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n+avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n+make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\n+patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n+\n+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n+modification follow.\n+\n+                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+  0. Definitions.\n+\n+  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n+\n+  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\n+works, such as semiconductor masks.\n+\n+  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n+License.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n+\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n+\n+  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n+in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\n+exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\n+earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n+\n+  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\n+on the Program.\n+\n+  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\n+permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n+infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\n+computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\n+distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\n+public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n+\n+  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n+parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\n+a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n+\n+  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\n+to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n+feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n+tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\n+extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\n+work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\n+the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n+menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n+\n+  1. Source Code.\n+\n+  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\n+for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\n+form of a work.\n+\n+  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\n+standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n+interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\n+is widely used among developers working in that language.\n+\n+  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\n+than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n+packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n+Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n+Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n+implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n+\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n+(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n+(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n+produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n+\n+  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\n+the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n+work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\n+control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\n+System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\n+programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\n+which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\n+includes interface definition files associated with source files for\n+the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\n+linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\n+such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\n+subprograms and other parts of the work.\n+\n+  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\n+can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\n+Source.\n+\n+  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\n+same work.\n+\n+  2. Basic Permissions.\n+\n+  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n+copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n+conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n+permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\n+covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n+content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\n+rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n+\n+  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n+convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\n+in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n+of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\n+with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n+the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\n+not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\n+for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n+and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\n+your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n+\n+  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n+the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n+makes it unnecessary.\n+\n+  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n+\n+  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n+measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n+11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\n+similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\n+measures.\n+\n+  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n+circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\n+is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\n+the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\n+modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\n+users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n+technological measures.\n+\n+  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n+\n+  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n+receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n+appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n+keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\n+non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\n+keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\n+recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n+\n+  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\n+and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n+\n+  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n+\n+  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\n+produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\n+terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n+\n+    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n+    it, and giving a relevant date.\n+\n+    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n+    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n+    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n+    \"keep intact all notices\".\n+\n+    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n+    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n+    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n+    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n+    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n+    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n+    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n+\n+    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n+    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n+    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n+    work need not make them do so.\n+\n+  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n+works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\n+and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\n+in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n+\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\n+used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n+beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\n+in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\n+parts of the aggregate.\n+\n+  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n+\n+  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\n+of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\n+machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\n+in one of these ways:\n+\n+    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n+    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n+    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n+    customarily used for software interchange.\n+\n+    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n+    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n+    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n+    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n+    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n+    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n+    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n+    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n+    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n+    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n+    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n+\n+    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n+    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n+    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n+    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n+    with subsection 6b.\n+\n+    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n+    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n+    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n+    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n+    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n+    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n+    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n+    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n+    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n+    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n+    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n+    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n+\n+    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n+    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n+    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n+    charge under subsection 6d.\n+\n+  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\n+from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\n+included in conveying the object code work.\n+\n+  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\n+tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\n+or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\n+into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\n+doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\n+product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\n+typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\n+of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\n+actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\n+is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n+commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n+the only significant mode of use of the product.\n+\n+  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\n+procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\n+and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\n+a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\n+suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\n+code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\n+modification has been made.\n+\n+  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\n+specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\n+part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\n+User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\n+fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\n+Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\n+by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\n+if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\n+modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\n+been installed in ROM).\n+\n+  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\n+requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\n+for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\n+the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\n+network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\n+adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\n+protocols for communication across the network.\n+\n+  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\n+in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\n+documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\n+source code form), and must require no special password or key for\n+unpacking, reading or copying.\n+\n+  7. Additional Terms.\n+\n+  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\n+License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n+Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\n+be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\n+that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\n+apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\n+under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n+this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n+\n+  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n+remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\n+it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n+removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\n+additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n+for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n+\n+  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n+add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\n+that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n+\n+    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n+    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n+\n+    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n+    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n+    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n+\n+    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n+    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n+    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n+\n+    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n+    authors of the material; or\n+\n+    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n+    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n+\n+    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n+    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n+    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n+    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n+    those licensors and authors.\n+\n+  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\n+restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\n+received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\n+governed by this License along with a term that is a further\n+restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\n+a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n+License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\n+of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\n+not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n+\n+  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\n+must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\n+additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n+where to find the applicable terms.\n+\n+  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\n+form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\n+the above requirements apply either way.\n+\n+  8. Termination.\n+\n+  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n+provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n+modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n+this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\n+paragraph of section 11).\n+\n+  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n+license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n+provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n+finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\n+holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n+prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n+\n+  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n+reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n+violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n+received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n+copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n+your receipt of the notice.\n+\n+  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n+licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n+this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n+reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\n+material under section 10.\n+\n+  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n+\n+  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n+run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n+occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n+to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\n+nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\n+modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\n+not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n+covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n+\n+  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n+\n+  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n+receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n+propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\n+for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n+\n+  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\n+organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n+organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\n+work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n+transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n+licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\n+give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n+Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n+the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n+\n+  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n+rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\n+not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n+rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n+(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n+any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\n+sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n+\n+  11. Patents.\n+\n+  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n+License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\n+work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n+\n+  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\n+owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\n+hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\n+by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\n+but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\n+consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\n+purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\n+patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\n+this License.\n+\n+  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n+patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\n+make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\n+propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n+\n+  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\n+agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n+(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n+sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\n+party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\n+patent against the party.\n+\n+  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n+and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n+to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\n+publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\n+then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\n+available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n+patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\n+consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\n+license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\n+actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\n+covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\n+in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\n+country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n+\n+  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n+arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\n+covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n+receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\n+or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\n+you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\n+work and works based on it.\n+\n+  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\n+the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\n+conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\n+specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\n+work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\n+in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\n+to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n+the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n+parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n+patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n+conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n+for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n+contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n+or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n+\n+  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\n+any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\n+otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n+\n+  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n+\n+  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\n+covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\n+not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\n+to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\n+the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n+License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n+\n+  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n+\n+  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n+permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n+under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\n+combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\n+License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\n+but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\n+section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\n+combination as such.\n+\n+  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n+\n+  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\n+the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n+address new problems or concerns.\n+\n+  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\n+Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\n+Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\n+option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\n+version or of any later version published by the Free Software\n+Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\n+GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\n+by the Free Software Foundation.\n+\n+  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n+versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\n+public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\n+to choose that version for the Program.\n+\n+  Later license versions may give you additional or different\n+permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\n+author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\n+later version.\n+\n+  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n+\n+  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\n+APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\n+HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\n+OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\n+THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\n+IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\n+ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n+\n+  16. Limitation of Liability.\n+\n+  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n+WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\n+THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n+GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\n+USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\n+DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\n+PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\n+EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n+SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n+\n+  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\n+above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\n+reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\n+an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\n+Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\n+copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n+\n+                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n+\n+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n+\n+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\n+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n+state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n+the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n+\n+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n+\n+    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n+    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n+    (at your option) any later version.\n+\n+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n+    GNU General Public License for more details.\n+\n+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n+    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n+\n+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n+\n+  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\n+notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n+\n+    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n+    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n+\n+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\n+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\n+might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n+\n+  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\n+if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\n+For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n+<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n+\n+  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\n+into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\n+may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\n+the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\n+Public License instead of this License.

Additional Definitions. \n+\n+  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\n+General Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\n+General Public License.\n+\n+  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\n+other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n+\n+  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\n+by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\n+Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\n+of using an interface provided by the Library.\n+\n+  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\n+Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\n+with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\n+Version\".\n+\n+  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\n+Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\n+for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\n+based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n+\n+  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\n+object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\n+and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\n+Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n+\n+  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n+\n+  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\n+without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n+\n+  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n+\n+  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\n+facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\n+that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\n+facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\n+version:\n+\n+   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n+   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n+   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n+   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n+\n+   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n+   this License applicable to that copy.\n+\n+  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n+\n+  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\n+a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\n+code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\n+material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\n+layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n+(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n+\n+   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n+   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n+   covered by this License.\n+\n+   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n+   document.\n+\n+  4. Combined Works.\n+\n+  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\n+taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\n+portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\n+engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\n+the following:\n+\n+   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n+   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n+   covered by this License.\n+\n+   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n+   document.\n+\n+   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n+   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n+   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n+   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n+\n+   d) Do one of the following:\n+\n+       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n+       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n+       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n+       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n+       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n+       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n+       Corresponding Source.\n+\n+       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n+       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n+       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n+       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n+       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n+       Version. \n+\n+   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n+   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n+   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n+   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n+   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n+   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.

By contrast,\n+the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n+share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n+software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n+GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n+any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\n+your programs, too.\n+\n+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n+them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n+want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n+free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n+\n+  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n+these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n+certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n+you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n+\n+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n+gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n+freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\n+or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\n+know their rights.\n+\n+  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n+(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n+giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n+\n+  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n+that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n+authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n+changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n+authors of previous versions.\n+\n+  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n+modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n+can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n+protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\n+pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n+use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\n+have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n+products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n+stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n+of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n+\n+  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n+States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n+software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n+avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n+make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\n+patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n+\n+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n+modification follow.\n+\n+                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+  0. Definitions.\n+\n+  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n+\n+  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\n+works, such as semiconductor masks.\n+\n+  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n+License.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n+\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n+\n+  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n+in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\n+exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\n+earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n+\n+  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\n+on the Program.\n+\n+  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\n+permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n+infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\n+computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\n+distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\n+public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n+\n+  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n+parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\n+a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n+\n+  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\n+to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n+feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n+tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\n+extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\n+work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\n+the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n+menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n+\n+  1. Source Code.\n+\n+  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\n+for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\n+form of a work.\n+\n+  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\n+standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n+interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\n+is widely used among developers working in that language.\n+\n+  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\n+than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n+packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n+Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n+Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n+implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n+\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n+(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n+(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n+produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n+\n+  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\n+the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n+work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\n+control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\n+System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\n+programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\n+which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\n+includes interface definition files associated with source files for\n+the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\n+linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\n+such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\n+subprograms and other parts of the work.\n+\n+  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\n+can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\n+Source.\n+\n+  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\n+same work.\n+\n+  2. Basic Permissions.\n+\n+  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n+copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n+conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n+permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\n+covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n+content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\n+rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n+\n+  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n+convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\n+in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n+of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\n+with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n+the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\n+not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\n+for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n+and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\n+your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n+\n+  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n+the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n+makes it unnecessary.\n+\n+  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n+\n+  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n+measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n+11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\n+similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\n+measures.\n+\n+  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n+circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\n+is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\n+the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\n+modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\n+users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n+technological measures.\n+\n+  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n+\n+  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n+receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n+appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n+keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\n+non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\n+keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\n+recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n+\n+  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\n+and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n+\n+  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n+\n+  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\n+produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\n+terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n+\n+    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n+    it, and giving a relevant date.\n+\n+    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n+    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n+    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n+    \"keep intact all notices\".\n+\n+    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n+    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n+    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n+    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n+    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n+    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n+    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n+\n+    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n+    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n+    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n+    work need not make them do so.\n+\n+  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n+works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\n+and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\n+in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n+\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\n+used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n+beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\n+in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\n+parts of the aggregate.\n+\n+  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n+\n+  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\n+of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\n+machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\n+in one of these ways:\n+\n+    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n+    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n+    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n+    customarily used for software interchange.\n+\n+    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n+    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n+    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n+    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n+    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n+    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n+    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n+    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n+    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n+    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n+    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n+\n+    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n+    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n+    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n+    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n+    with subsection 6b.\n+\n+    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n+    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n+    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n+    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n+    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n+    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n+    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n+    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n+    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n+    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n+    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n+    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n+\n+    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n+    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n+    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n+    charge under subsection 6d.\n+\n+  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\n+from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\n+included in conveying the object code work.\n+\n+  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\n+tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\n+or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\n+into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\n+doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\n+product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\n+typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\n+of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\n+actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\n+is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n+commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n+the only significant mode of use of the product.\n+\n+  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\n+procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\n+and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\n+a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\n+suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\n+code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\n+modification has been made.\n+\n+  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\n+specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\n+part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\n+User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\n+fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\n+Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\n+by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\n+if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\n+modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\n+been installed in ROM).\n+\n+  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\n+requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\n+for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\n+the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\n+network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\n+adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\n+protocols for communication across the network.\n+\n+  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\n+in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\n+documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\n+source code form), and must require no special password or key for\n+unpacking, reading or copying.\n+\n+  7. Additional Terms.\n+\n+  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\n+License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n+Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\n+be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\n+that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\n+apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\n+under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n+this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n+\n+  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n+remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\n+it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n+removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\n+additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n+for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n+\n+  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n+add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\n+that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n+\n+    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n+    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n+\n+    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n+    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n+    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n+\n+    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n+    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n+    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n+\n+    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n+    authors of the material; or\n+\n+    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n+    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n+\n+    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n+    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n+    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n+    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n+    those licensors and authors.\n+\n+  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\n+restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\n+received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\n+governed by this License along with a term that is a further\n+restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\n+a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n+License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\n+of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\n+not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n+\n+  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\n+must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\n+additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n+where to find the applicable terms.\n+\n+  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\n+form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\n+the above requirements apply either way.\n+\n+  8. Termination.\n+\n+  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n+provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n+modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n+this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\n+paragraph of section 11).\n+\n+  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n+license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n+provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n+finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\n+holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n+prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n+\n+  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n+reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n+violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n+received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n+copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n+your receipt of the notice.\n+\n+  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n+licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n+this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n+reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\n+material under section 10.\n+\n+  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n+\n+  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n+run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n+occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n+to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\n+nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\n+modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\n+not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n+covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n+\n+  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n+\n+  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n+receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n+propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\n+for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n+\n+  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\n+organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n+organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\n+work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n+transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n+licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\n+give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n+Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n+the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n+\n+  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n+rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\n+not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n+rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n+(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n+any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\n+sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n+\n+  11. Patents.\n+\n+  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n+License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\n+work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n+\n+  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\n+owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\n+hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\n+by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\n+but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\n+consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\n+purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\n+patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\n+this License.\n+\n+  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n+patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\n+make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\n+propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n+\n+  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\n+agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n+(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n+sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\n+party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\n+patent against the party.\n+\n+  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n+and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n+to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\n+publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\n+then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\n+available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n+patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\n+consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\n+license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\n+actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\n+covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\n+in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\n+country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n+\n+  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n+arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\n+covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n+receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\n+or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\n+you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\n+work and works based on it.\n+\n+  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\n+the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\n+conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\n+specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\n+work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\n+in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\n+to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n+the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n+parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n+patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n+conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n+for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n+contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n+or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n+\n+  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\n+any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\n+otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n+\n+  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n+\n+  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\n+covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\n+not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\n+to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\n+the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n+License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n+\n+  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n+\n+  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n+permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n+under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\n+combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\n+License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\n+but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\n+section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\n+combination as such.\n+\n+  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n+\n+  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\n+the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n+address new problems or concerns.\n+\n+  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\n+Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\n+Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\n+option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\n+version or of any later version published by the Free Software\n+Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\n+GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\n+by the Free Software Foundation.\n+\n+  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n+versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\n+public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\n+to choose that version for the Program.\n+\n+  Later license versions may give you additional or different\n+permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\n+author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\n+later version.\n+\n+  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n+\n+  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\n+APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\n+HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\n+OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\n+THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\n+IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\n+ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n+\n+  16. Limitation of Liability.\n+\n+  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n+WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\n+THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n+GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\n+USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\n+DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\n+PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\n+EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n+SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n+\n+  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\n+above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\n+reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\n+an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\n+Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\n+copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n+\n+                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n+\n+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n+\n+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\n+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n+state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n+the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n+\n+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n+\n+    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n+    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n+    (at your option) any later version.\n+\n+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n+    GNU General Public License for more details.\n+\n+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n+    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n+\n+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n+\n+  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\n+notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n+\n+    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n+    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n+\n+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\n+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\n+might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n+\n+  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\n+if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\n+For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n+<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n+\n+  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\n+into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\n+may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\n+the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\n+Public License instead of this License.

Additional Definitions. \n+\n+  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\n+General Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\n+General Public License.\n+\n+  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\n+other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n+\n+  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\n+by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\n+Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\n+of using an interface provided by the Library.\n+\n+  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\n+Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\n+with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\n+Version\".\n+\n+  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\n+Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\n+for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\n+based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n+\n+  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\n+object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\n+and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\n+Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n+\n+  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n+\n+  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\n+without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n+\n+  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n+\n+  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\n+facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\n+that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\n+facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\n+version:\n+\n+   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n+   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n+   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n+   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n+\n+   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n+   this License applicable to that copy.\n+\n+  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n+\n+  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\n+a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\n+code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\n+material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\n+layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n+(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n+\n+   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n+   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n+   covered by this License.\n+\n+   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n+   document.\n+\n+  4. Combined Works.\n+\n+  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\n+taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\n+portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\n+engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\n+the following:\n+\n+   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n+   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n+   covered by this License.\n+\n+   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n+   document.\n+\n+   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n+   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n+   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n+   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n+\n+   d) Do one of the following:\n+\n+       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n+       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n+       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n+       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n+       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n+       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n+       Corresponding Source.\n+\n+       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n+       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n+       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n+       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n+       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n+       Version. \n+\n+   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n+   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n+   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n+   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n+   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n+   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n+   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n+   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n+   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n+   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n+   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n+\n+  5. Combined Libraries.\n+\n+  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n+Library side by side in a single library together with other library\n+facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\n+License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\n+choice, if you do both of the following:\n+\n+   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n+   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n+   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n+\n+   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n+   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n+   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n+\n+  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n+\n+  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n+of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\n+versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n+differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n+\n+  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\n+Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\n+of the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\n+applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\n+conditions either of that published version or of any later version\n+published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\n+received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\n+General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\n+General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n+\n+  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\n+whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\n+apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\n+permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\n+Library."}, {"sha": "0b40dc469bf85da28d1e074a7fbc0bc3dfb74148", "filename": "gcc/ChangeLog", "status": "modified", "additions": 9, "deletions": 0, "changes": 9, "blob_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/4c85af60e8b5736e5534fee89d1a671b9f3ab7a9/gcc%2FChangeLog", "raw_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/raw/4c85af60e8b5736e5534fee89d1a671b9f3ab7a9/gcc%2FChangeLog", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/contents/gcc%2FChangeLog?ref=4c85af60e8b5736e5534fee89d1a671b9f3ab7a9", "patch": "@@ -1,3 +1,12 @@\n+2007-07-17  Nick Clifton  <nickc@redhat.com>\n+\n+\t* COPYING_v3: New file.

By contrast,\n+the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom\n+to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains\n+free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation,\n+use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it\n+applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You\n+can apply it to your programs, too.\n+\n+When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n+them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n+want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n+free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n+\n+To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n+these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you\n+have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the\n+software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\n+of others.\n+\n+For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n+gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n+freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too,\n+receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these\n+terms so they know their rights.\n+\n+Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n+(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n+giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n+\n+For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n+that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n+authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n+changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n+authors of previous versions.\n+\n+Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n+modified versions of the software inside them, although the\n+manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the\n+aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The\n+systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for\n+individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.\n+Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the\n+practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in\n+other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those\n+domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the\n+freedom of users.\n+\n+Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n+States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n+software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\n+to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\n+could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL\n+assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n+\n+The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n+modification follow.\n+\n+@heading TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+@enumerate 0\n+@item Definitions.\n+\n+``This License'' refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n+\n+``Copyright'' also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds\n+of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n+\n+``The Program'' refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n+License.  Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.  ``Licensees'' and\n+``recipients'' may be individuals or organizations.\n+\n+To ``modify'' a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n+in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of\n+an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a ``modified version'' of\n+the earlier work or a work ``based on'' the earlier work.\n+\n+A ``covered work'' means either the unmodified Program or a work based\n+on the Program.\n+\n+To ``propagate'' a work means to do anything with it that, without\n+permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n+infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\n+computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\n+distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\n+public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n+\n+To ``convey'' a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n+parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user\n+through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not\n+conveying.\n+\n+An interactive user interface displays ``Appropriate Legal Notices'' to\n+the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n+feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n+tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\n+extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\n+work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\n+the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n+menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n+\n+@item Source Code.\n+\n+The ``source code'' for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n+making modifications to it.  ``Object code'' means any non-source form\n+of a work.\n+\n+A ``Standard Interface'' means an interface that either is an official\n+standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n+interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\n+is widely used among developers working in that language.\n+\n+The ``System Libraries'' of an executable work include anything, other\n+than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n+packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n+Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n+Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n+implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n+``Major Component'', in this context, means a major essential component\n+(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n+(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n+produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n+\n+The ``Corresponding Source'' for a work in object code form means all\n+the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n+work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\n+control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\n+System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\n+programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\n+which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\n+includes interface definition files associated with source files for\n+the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\n+linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\n+such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\n+subprograms and other parts of the work.\n+\n+The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\n+regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n+\n+The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same\n+work.\n+\n+@item Basic Permissions.\n+\n+All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n+copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n+conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n+permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\n+covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n+content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\n+rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n+\n+You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,\n+without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.\n+You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having\n+them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with\n+facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the\n+terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\n+control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for\n+you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and\n+control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your\n+copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n+\n+Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the\n+conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n+makes it unnecessary.\n+\n+@item Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n+\n+No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n+measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n+11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\n+similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\n+measures.\n+\n+When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n+circumvention of technological measures to the extent such\n+circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with\n+respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit\n+operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against\n+the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid\n+circumvention of technological measures.\n+\n+@item Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n+\n+You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n+receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n+appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n+keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\n+non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\n+keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\n+recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n+\n+You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\n+and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n+\n+@item Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n+\n+You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\n+produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\n+terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these\n+conditions:\n+\n+@enumerate a\n+@item \n+The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,\n+and giving a relevant date.\n+\n+@item\n+The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released\n+under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This\n+requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to ``keep intact all\n+notices''.\n+\n+@item\n+You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to\n+anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will\n+therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,\n+to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they\n+are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in\n+any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have\n+separately received it.\n+\n+@item\n+If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n+Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n+interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work\n+need not make them do so.\n+@end enumerate\n+\n+A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n+works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\n+and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\n+in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n+``aggregate'' if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\n+used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n+beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\n+in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\n+parts of the aggregate.\n+\n+@item  Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n+\n+You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of\n+sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable\n+Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these\n+ways:\n+\n+@enumerate a\n+@item\n+Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n+(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n+Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily\n+used for software interchange.\n+\n+@item\n+Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n+(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written\n+offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you\n+offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give\n+anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the\n+Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is\n+covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used\n+for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable\n+cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access\n+to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n+\n+@item\n+Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written\n+offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is\n+allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you\n+received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection\n+6b.\n+\n+@item\n+Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place\n+(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n+Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n+further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n+Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy\n+the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be\n+on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports\n+equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions\n+next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.\n+Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain\n+obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to\n+satisfy these requirements.\n+\n+@item\n+Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you\n+inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of\n+the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under\n+subsection 6d.\n+\n+@end enumerate\n+\n+A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\n+from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\n+included in conveying the object code work.\n+\n+A ``User Product'' is either (1) a ``consumer product'', which means any\n+tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,\n+family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for\n+incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a\n+consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of\n+coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,\n+``normally used'' refers to a typical or common use of that class of\n+product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way\n+in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected\n+to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of\n+whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or\n+non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant\n+mode of use of the product.\n+\n+``Installation Information'' for a User Product means any methods,\n+procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to\n+install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User\n+Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The\n+information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of\n+the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with\n+solely because modification has been made.\n+\n+If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\n+specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\n+part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\n+User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\n+fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\n+Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\n+by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\n+if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\n+modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\n+been installed in ROM).\n+\n+The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\n+requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or\n+updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the\n+recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or\n+installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification\n+itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network\n+or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the\n+network.\n+\n+Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\n+in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\n+documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\n+source code form), and must require no special password or key for\n+unpacking, reading or copying.\n+\n+@item Additional Terms.\n+\n+``Additional permissions'' are terms that supplement the terms of this\n+License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n+Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\n+be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\n+that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\n+apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\n+under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n+this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n+\n+When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n+remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\n+it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n+removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\n+additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n+for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n+\n+Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n+add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders\n+of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n+\n+@enumerate a\n+@item\n+Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms\n+of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n+\n+@item\n+Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author\n+attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices\n+displayed by works containing it; or\n+\n+@item\n+Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n+requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n+reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n+\n+@item\n+Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n+authors of the material; or\n+\n+@item\n+Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade\n+names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n+\n+@item\n+Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by\n+anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with\n+contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any\n+liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those\n+licensors and authors.\n+@end enumerate\n+\n+All other non-permissive additional terms are considered ``further\n+restrictions'' within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\n+received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\n+governed by this License along with a term that is a further\n+restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\n+a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n+License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\n+of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\n+not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n+\n+If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\n+must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\n+additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n+where to find the applicable terms.\n+\n+Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\n+form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the\n+above requirements apply either way.\n+\n+@item Termination.\n+\n+You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n+provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n+modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n+this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\n+paragraph of section 11).\n+\n+However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\n+from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\n+unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\n+terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder\n+fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to\n+60 days after the cessation.\n+\n+Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n+reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n+violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n+received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n+copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n+your receipt of the notice.\n+\n+Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n+licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n+this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n+reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\n+material under section 10.\n+\n+@item Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n+\n+You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run\n+a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n+occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n+to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\n+nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\n+modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\n+not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n+covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n+\n+@item Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n+\n+Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n+receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n+propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\n+for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n+\n+An ``entity transaction'' is a transaction transferring control of an\n+organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n+organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\n+work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n+transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n+licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\n+give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n+Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n+the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n+\n+You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n+rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\n+not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n+rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n+(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n+any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\n+sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n+\n+@item Patents.\n+\n+A ``contributor'' is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n+License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\n+work thus licensed is called the contributor's ``contributor version''.\n+\n+A contributor's ``essential patent claims'' are all patent claims owned\n+or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\n+hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\n+by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\n+but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\n+consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\n+purposes of this definition, ``control'' includes the right to grant\n+patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\n+this License.\n+\n+Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n+patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\n+make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\n+propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n+\n+In the following three paragraphs, a ``patent license'' is any express\n+agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n+(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n+sue for patent infringement).  To ``grant'' such a patent license to a\n+party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\n+patent against the party.\n+\n+If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n+and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n+to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\n+publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\n+then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\n+available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n+patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\n+consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\n+license to downstream recipients.  ``Knowingly relying'' means you have\n+actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\n+covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\n+in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\n+country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n+\n+If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n+arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\n+covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n+receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\n+or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\n+you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\n+work and works based on it.\n+\n+A patent license is ``discriminatory'' if it does not include within the\n+scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on\n+the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\n+granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you\n+are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\n+business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the\n+third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the\n+work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\n+who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent\n+license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by\n+you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in\n+connection with specific products or compilations that contain the\n+covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent\n+license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n+\n+Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\n+any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\n+otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n+\n+@item No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n+\n+If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey\n+a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under\n+this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\n+consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree\n+to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\n+from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could\n+satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely\n+from conveying the Program.\n+\n+@item Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n+\n+Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n+permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n+under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\n+combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\n+License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\n+but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\n+section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\n+combination as such.\n+\n+@item Revised Versions of this License.\n+\n+The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n+of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new\n+versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n+differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n+\n+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n+specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public\n+License ``or any later version'' applies to it, you have the option of\n+following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or\n+of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If\n+the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General\n+Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\n+Software Foundation.\n+\n+If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions\n+of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public\n+statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to\n+choose that version for the Program.\n+\n+Later license versions may give you additional or different\n+permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\n+author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\n+later version.\n+\n+@item Disclaimer of Warranty.\n+\n+THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\n+APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\n+HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ``AS IS'' WITHOUT\n+WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\n+LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\n+A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n+PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\n+DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\n+CORRECTION.\n+\n+@item Limitation of Liability.\n+\n+IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n+WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR\n+CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\n+INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\n+ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT\n+NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR\n+LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM\n+TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\n+PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+@item Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n+\n+If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\n+above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\n+reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\n+an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\n+Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\n+copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n+\n+@end enumerate\n+\n+@heading END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+@heading How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n+\n+If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\n+terms.\n+\n+To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\n+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n+state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n+the ``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n+\n+@smallexample\n+@var{one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}  \n+Copyright (C) @var{year} @var{name of author}\n+\n+This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n+it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n+the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at\n+your option) any later version.\n+\n+This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\n+WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n+MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

By contrast,\n+the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n+share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n+software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n+GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n+any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\n+your programs, too.\n+\n+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n+them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n+want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n+free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n+\n+  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n+these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n+certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n+you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n+\n+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n+gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n+freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\n+or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\n+know their rights.\n+\n+  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n+(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n+giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n+\n+  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n+that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n+authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n+changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n+authors of previous versions.\n+\n+  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n+modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n+can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n+protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\n+pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n+use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\n+have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n+products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n+stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n+of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n+\n+  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n+States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n+software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n+avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n+make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\n+patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n+\n+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n+modification follow.\n+\n+                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+  0. Definitions.\n+\n+  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n+\n+  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\n+works, such as semiconductor masks.\n+\n+  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n+License.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n+\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n+\n+  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n+in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\n+exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\n+earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n+\n+  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\n+on the Program.\n+\n+  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\n+permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n+infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\n+computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\n+distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\n+public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n+\n+  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n+parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\n+a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n+\n+  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\n+to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n+feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n+tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\n+extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\n+work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\n+the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n+menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n+\n+  1. Source Code.\n+\n+  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\n+for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\n+form of a work.\n+\n+  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\n+standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n+interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\n+is widely used among developers working in that language.\n+\n+  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\n+than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n+packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n+Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n+Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n+implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n+\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n+(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n+(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n+produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n+\n+  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\n+the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n+work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\n+control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\n+System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\n+programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\n+which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\n+includes interface definition files associated with source files for\n+the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\n+linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\n+such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\n+subprograms and other parts of the work.\n+\n+  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\n+can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\n+Source.\n+\n+  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\n+same work.\n+\n+  2. Basic Permissions.\n+\n+  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n+copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n+conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n+permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\n+covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n+content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\n+rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n+\n+  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n+convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\n+in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n+of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\n+with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n+the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\n+not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\n+for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n+and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\n+your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n+\n+  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n+the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n+makes it unnecessary.\n+\n+  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n+\n+  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n+measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n+11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\n+similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\n+measures.\n+\n+  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n+circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\n+is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\n+the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\n+modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\n+users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n+technological measures.\n+\n+  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n+\n+  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n+receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n+appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n+keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\n+non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\n+keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\n+recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n+\n+  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\n+and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n+\n+  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n+\n+  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\n+produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\n+terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n+\n+    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n+    it, and giving a relevant date.\n+\n+    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n+    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n+    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n+    \"keep intact all notices\".\n+\n+    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n+    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n+    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n+    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n+    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n+    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n+    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n+\n+    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n+    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n+    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n+    work need not make them do so.\n+\n+  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n+works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\n+and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\n+in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n+\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\n+used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n+beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\n+in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\n+parts of the aggregate.\n+\n+  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n+\n+  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\n+of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\n+machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\n+in one of these ways:\n+\n+    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n+    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n+    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n+    customarily used for software interchange.\n+\n+    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n+    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n+    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n+    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n+    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n+    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n+    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n+    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n+    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n+    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n+    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n+\n+    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n+    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n+    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n+    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n+    with subsection 6b.\n+\n+    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n+    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n+    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n+    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n+    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n+    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n+    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n+    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n+    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n+    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n+    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n+    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n+\n+    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n+    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n+    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n+    charge under subsection 6d.\n+\n+  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\n+from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\n+included in conveying the object code work.\n+\n+  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\n+tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\n+or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\n+into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\n+doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\n+product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\n+typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\n+of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\n+actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\n+is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n+commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n+the only significant mode of use of the product.\n+\n+  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\n+procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\n+and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\n+a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\n+suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\n+code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\n+modification has been made.\n+\n+  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\n+specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\n+part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\n+User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\n+fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\n+Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\n+by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\n+if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\n+modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\n+been installed in ROM).\n+\n+  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\n+requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\n+for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\n+the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\n+network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\n+adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\n+protocols for communication across the network.\n+\n+  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\n+in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\n+documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\n+source code form), and must require no special password or key for\n+unpacking, reading or copying.\n+\n+  7. Additional Terms.\n+\n+  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\n+License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n+Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\n+be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\n+that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\n+apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\n+under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n+this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n+\n+  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n+remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\n+it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n+removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\n+additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n+for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n+\n+  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n+add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\n+that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n+\n+    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n+    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n+\n+    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n+    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n+    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n+\n+    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n+    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n+    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n+\n+    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n+    authors of the material; or\n+\n+    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n+    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n+\n+    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n+    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n+    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n+    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n+    those licensors and authors.\n+\n+  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\n+restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\n+received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\n+governed by this License along with a term that is a further\n+restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\n+a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n+License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\n+of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\n+not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n+\n+  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\n+must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\n+additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n+where to find the applicable terms.\n+\n+  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\n+form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\n+the above requirements apply either way.\n+\n+  8. Termination.\n+\n+  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n+provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n+modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n+this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\n+paragraph of section 11).\n+\n+  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n+license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n+provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n+finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\n+holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n+prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n+\n+  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n+reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n+violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n+received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n+copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n+your receipt of the notice.\n+\n+  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n+licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n+this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n+reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\n+material under section 10.\n+\n+  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n+\n+  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n+run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n+occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n+to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\n+nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\n+modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\n+not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n+covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n+\n+  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n+\n+  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n+receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n+propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\n+for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n+\n+  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\n+organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n+organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\n+work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n+transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n+licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\n+give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n+Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n+the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n+\n+  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n+rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\n+not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n+rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n+(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n+any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\n+sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n+\n+  11. Patents.\n+\n+  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n+License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\n+work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n+\n+  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\n+owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\n+hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\n+by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\n+but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\n+consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\n+purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\n+patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\n+this License.\n+\n+  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n+patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\n+make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\n+propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n+\n+  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\n+agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n+(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n+sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\n+party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\n+patent against the party.\n+\n+  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n+and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n+to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\n+publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\n+then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\n+available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n+patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\n+consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\n+license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\n+actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\n+covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\n+in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\n+country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n+\n+  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n+arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\n+covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n+receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\n+or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\n+you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\n+work and works based on it.\n+\n+  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\n+the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\n+conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\n+specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\n+work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\n+in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\n+to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n+the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n+parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n+patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n+conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n+for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n+contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n+or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n+\n+  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\n+any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\n+otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n+\n+  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n+\n+  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\n+covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\n+not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\n+to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\n+the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n+License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n+\n+  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n+\n+  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n+permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n+under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\n+combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\n+License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\n+but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\n+section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\n+combination as such.\n+\n+  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n+\n+  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\n+the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n+address new problems or concerns.\n+\n+  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\n+Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\n+Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\n+option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\n+version or of any later version published by the Free Software\n+Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\n+GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\n+by the Free Software Foundation.\n+\n+  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n+versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\n+public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\n+to choose that version for the Program.\n+\n+  Later license versions may give you additional or different\n+permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\n+author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\n+later version.\n+\n+  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n+\n+  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\n+APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\n+HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\n+OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\n+THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\n+IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\n+ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n+\n+  16. Limitation of Liability.\n+\n+  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n+WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\n+THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n+GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\n+USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\n+DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\n+PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\n+EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n+SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n+\n+  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\n+above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\n+reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\n+an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\n+Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\n+copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n+\n+                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n+\n+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n+\n+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\n+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n+state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n+the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n+\n+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n+\n+    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n+    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n+    (at your option) any later version.\n+\n+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n+    GNU General Public License for more details.\n+\n+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n+    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n+\n+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n+\n+  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\n+notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n+\n+    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n+    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n+\n+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\n+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\n+might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n+\n+  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\n+if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\n+For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n+<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n+\n+  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\n+into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\n+may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\n+the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\n+Public License instead of this License.
