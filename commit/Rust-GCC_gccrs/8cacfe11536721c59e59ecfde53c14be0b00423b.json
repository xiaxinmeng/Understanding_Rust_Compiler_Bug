It was introduced in an early release of `egcs'.\n+\n+   * Valid combinations of `EXTERNAL', passing that external as a dummy\n+     argument without explicitly giving it a type, and, in a subsequent\n+     program unit, referencing that external as an external function\n+     with a different type no longer crash `g77'.\n+\n+   * `CASE DEFAULT' no longer crashes `g77'.\n+\n+   * The `-Wunused' option no longer issues a spurious warning about\n+     the \"master\" procedure generated by `g77' for procedures\n+     containing `ENTRY' statements.\n+\n+   * Support `FORMAT(I<EXPR>)' when EXPR is a compile-time constant\n+     `INTEGER' expression.\n+\n+   * Fix `g77' `-g' option so procedures that use `ENTRY' can be\n+     stepped through, line by line, in `gdb'.\n+\n+   * Allow any `REAL' argument to intrinsics `Second' and `CPU_Time'.\n+\n+   * Use `tempnam', if available, to open scratch files (as in\n+     `OPEN(STATUS='SCRATCH')') so that the `TMPDIR' environment\n+     variable, if present, is used.\n+\n+   * `g77''s version of `libf2c' separates out the setting of global\n+     state (such as command-line arguments and signal handling) from\n+     `main.o' into distinct, new library archive members.\n+\n+     This should make it easier to write portable applications that\n+     have their own (non-Fortran) `main()' routine properly set up the\n+     `libf2c' environment, even when `libf2c' (now `libg2c') is a\n+     shared library.\n+\n+   * `g77' no longer installs the `f77' command and `f77.1' man page in\n+     the `/usr' or `/usr/local' heirarchy, even if the `f77-install-ok'\n+     file exists in the source or build directory.

It is installed only in the `gcc' \"private\" directory\n+     heirarchy, `gcc-lib'.  This allows system administrators and users\n+     to choose which version of the `libf2c' library from `netlib' they\n+     wish to use on a case-by-case basis.  See the installation\n+     documentation for more information.\n+\n+   * The `f2c.h' include (header) file produced by `g77' has been\n+     renamed to `g2c.h'.

See the\n+     installation documentation for more information.\n+\n+   * The `g77' command now expects the run-time library to be named\n+     `libg2c.a' instead of `libf2c.a', to ensure that a version other\n+     than the one built and installed as part of the same `g77' version\n+     is picked up.\n+\n+   * During the configuration and build process, `g77' creates\n+     subdirectories it needs only as it needs them.  Other cleaning up\n+     of the configuration and build process has been performed as well.\n+\n+   * `install-info' now used to update the directory of Info\n+     documentation to contain an entry for `g77' (during installation).\n+\n+   * Some diagnostics have been changed from warnings to errors, to\n+     prevent inadvertent use of the resulting, probably buggy, programs.\n+     These mostly include diagnostics about use of unsupported features\n+     in the `OPEN', `INQUIRE', `READ', and `WRITE' statements, and\n+     about truncations of various sorts of constants.\n+\n+   * Improve compilation of `FORMAT' expressions so that a null byte is\n+     appended to the last operand if it is a constant.
