Direct and indirect buffers work, \n+  as do fundamental file and socket operations.\n+\n+* java.awt has been improved, though it is still not ready for general use.\n+\n+* The HTTP protocol handler now uses HTTP/1.1 and can handle the POST method.\n+\n+* The MinGW port has matured. Enhancements include socket timeout support, \n+  thread interruption, improved Runtime.exec() handling and support for \n+  accented characters in filenames.\n+\n+*** Changes in GCC 3.3:\n+\n+* The java.sql and javax.sql packages now implement the JDBC 3.0 (JDK 1.4) \n+  API.\n+\n+* The JDK 1.4 assert facility has been implemented.\n+\n+* The bytecode interpreter is now direct threaded and thus faster.\n+\n+\n+*** Changes in GCC 3.1:\n+\n+* libgcj now includes RMI, java.lang.ref.*, javax.naming, and \n+  javax.transaction.\n+\n+* Property files and other system resources can be compiled into executables \n+  which use libgcj using the new gcj --resource feature.\n+\n+* libgcj has been ported to more platforms. In particular there is now a \n+  mostly-functional mingw32 (Windows) target port.\n+\n+* JNI and CNI invocation interfaces were implemented, so gcj-compiled Java \n+  code can now be called from a C/C++ application.\n+\n+* gcj can now use builtin functions for certain known methods, for instance \n+  Math.cos.\n+\n+* gcj can now automatically remove redundant array-store checks in some common \n+  cases.\n+\n+* The --no-store-checks optimization option was added. This can be used to \n+  omit runtime store checks for code which is known not to throw \n+  ArrayStoreException\n+\n+* The following third party interface standards were added to libgcj: \n+  org.w3c.dom and org.xml.sax.\n+\n+* java.security has been merged with GNU Classpath. The new package is now \n+  JDK 1.2 compliant, and much more complete.\n+\n+* A bytecode verifier was added to the libgcj interpreter.\n+\n+* java.lang.Character was rewritten to comply with the Unicode 3.0 standard, \n+  and improve performance.\n+\n+* Partial support for many more locales was added to libgcj.\n+\n+* Socket timeouts have been implemented.\n+\n+* libgcj has been merged into a single shared library. There are no longer \n+  separate shared libraries for the garbage collector and zlib.\n+\n+* Several performance improvements were made to gcj and libgcj:\n+      o Hash synchronization (thin locks)\n+      o A special allocation path for finalizer-free objects\n+      o Thread-local allocation\n+      o Parallel GC, and other GC tweaks\n+\n+*** Changes in GCC 3.0:\n \n * libgcj now includes a bytecode interpreter.
