TestTerminalSignal, as part of its workload,\n        will execute a new interactive bash shell. Bash will attempt to load the\n        user's history from the file pointed to by the HISTFILE environment\n        variable. For users with large histories that may take up to several\n        seconds, pushing the whole test past the 5 second timeout and causing\n        it to fail.\n    \n    Reviewed-on: https://go-review.googlesource.com/107624\n\nFrom-SVN: r259452", "tree": {"sha": "8a0194d7a74fe1d3e338b1264736cc80e6610a0a", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/git/trees/8a0194d7a74fe1d3e338b1264736cc80e6610a0a"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/git/commits/4ba010501965cca2091ac1e702105c623ea115b5", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/4ba010501965cca2091ac1e702105c623ea115b5", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commit/4ba010501965cca2091ac1e702105c623ea115b5", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/4ba010501965cca2091ac1e702105c623ea115b5/comments", "author": null, "committer": null, "parents": [{"sha": "b5872261d5e448c85903c4f3df7e1970fc4c112a", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/b5872261d5e448c85903c4f3df7e1970fc4c112a", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commit/b5872261d5e448c85903c4f3df7e1970fc4c112a"}], "stats": {"total": 4, "additions": 3, "deletions": 1}, "files": [{"sha": "aeba5254fe61ff84ff972c7f747d440596b0f803", "filename": "gcc/go/gofrontend/MERGE", "status": "modified", "additions": 1, "deletions": 1, "changes": 2, "blob_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/4ba010501965cca2091ac1e702105c623ea115b5/gcc%2Fgo%2Fgofrontend%2FMERGE", "raw_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/raw/4ba010501965cca2091ac1e702105c623ea115b5/gcc%2Fgo%2Fgofrontend%2FMERGE", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/contents/gcc%2Fgo%2Fgofrontend%2FMERGE?ref=4ba010501965cca2091ac1e702105c623ea115b5", "patch": "@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@\n-2c7093358e5f5ebeb102d44d1036ca0a807d46a5\n+b367349d85f315e94e10ee2d76a7c6a46b993dcb\n \n The first line of this file holds the git revision number of the last\n merge done from the gofrontend repository."}, {"sha": "16aeea8221cdcb89d16c1a442aac3da8b31caefc", "filename": "libgo/go/os/signal/signal_cgo_test.go", "status": "modified", "additions": 2, "deletions": 0, "changes": 2, "blob_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/4ba010501965cca2091ac1e702105c623ea115b5/libgo%2Fgo%2Fos%2Fsignal%2Fsignal_cgo_test.go", "raw_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/raw/4ba010501965cca2091ac1e702105c623ea115b5/libgo%2Fgo%2Fos%2Fsignal%2Fsignal_cgo_test.go", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/contents/libgo%2Fgo%2Fos%2Fsignal%2Fsignal_cgo_test.go?ref=4ba010501965cca2091ac1e702105c623ea115b5", "patch": "@@ -89,6 +89,8 @@ func TestTerminalSignal(t *testing.T) {\n \tctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)\n \tdefer cancel()\n \tcmd := exec.CommandContext(ctx, bash, \"--norc\", \"--noprofile\", \"-i\")\n+\t// Clear HISTFILE so that we don't read or clobber the user's bash history.\n+\tcmd.Env = append(os.Environ(), \"HISTFILE=\")\n \tcmd.Stdin = slave\n \tcmd.Stdout = slave\n \tcmd.Stderr = slave"}]}
