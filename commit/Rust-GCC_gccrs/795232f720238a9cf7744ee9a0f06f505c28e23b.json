Digital Alpha (AXP) systems\n+running ELF.\n+These should be fairly representative of 32-bit and 64-bit\n+systems, respectively.\n+\n+Note that all sizes are approximate and subject to change without\n+notice!\n+They are based on preliminary releases of g77 made shortly\n+before the public beta release.\n+\n+@itemize ---\n+@item\n+@code{gcc} and @code{g77} distributions occupy 8.6MB\n+packed, 35MB unpacked.\n+These consist of the source code and documentation,\n+plus some derived files (mostly documentation), for\n+@code{gcc} and @code{g77}.\n+Any deviations from these numbers for different\n+kinds of systems are likely to be very minor.\n+\n+@item\n+A ``bootstrap'' build requires an additional 67.3MB\n+for a total of 102MB on an ix86, and an additional\n+98MB for a total of 165MB on an Alpha.\n+\n+@item\n+Removing @file{gcc/stage1} after the build recovers\n+10.7MB for a total of 91MB on an ix86, and recovers\n+??MB for a total of ??MB on an Alpha.\n \n-Some juggling can reduce the amount of space needed;\n-during the bootstrap process, once Stage 3 starts,\n-during which the version of @code{gcc} that has been copied\n-into the @file{stage2/} directory is used to rebuild the\n-system, you can delete the @file{stage1/} directory\n-to free up some space.\n+After doing this, the integrity of the build can\n+still be verified via @samp{make compare}, and the\n+@code{gcc} compiler modified and used to build itself for\n+testing fairly quickly, using the copy of the compiler\n+kept in @code{gcc/stage2}.\n \n-It is likely that many systems don't require the complete\n-bootstrap build, as they already have a recent version of\n-@code{gcc} installed.\n-Such systems might be able to build @code{g77} with only\n-about 75MB of free space.\n+@item\n+Removing @file{gcc/stage2} after the build further\n+recovers 27.3MB for a total of 64.3MB, and recovers\n+??MB for a total of ??MB on an Alpha.\n+\n+After doing this, the compiler can still be installed,\n+especially if GNU @code{make} is used to avoid\n+gratuitous rebuilds (or, the installation can be done\n+by hand).\n+\n+@item\n+Installing @code{gcc} and @code{g77} copies\n+14.9MB onto the @samp{--prefix} disk for a total of 79.2MB\n+on an ix86, and copies ??MB onto the @samp{--prefix}\n+disk for a total of ??MB on an Alpha.\n+@end itemize\n+\n+After installation, if no further modifications and\n+builds of @code{gcc} or @code{g77} are planned, the\n+source and build directory may be removed, leaving\n+the total impact on a system's disk storage as\n+that of the amount copied during installation.\n+\n+Systems with the appropriate version of @code{gcc}\n+installed don't require the complete\n+bootstrap build.\n+Doing a ``straight build'' requires about as much\n+space as does a bootstrap build followed by removing\n+both the @file{gcc/stage1} and @file{gcc/stage2}\n+directories.\n+\n+Installing @code{gcc} and @code{g77} over existing\n+versions might require less @emph{new} disk space,\n+but note that, unlike many products, @code{gcc}\n+installs itself in a way that avoids overwriting other\n+installed versions of itself, so that other versions may\n+easily be invoked (via @samp{gcc -V @var{version}}).\n+\n+So, the amount of space saved as a result of having\n+an existing version of @code{gcc} and @code{g77}\n+already installed is not much---typically only the\n+command drivers (@code{gcc}, @code{g77}, @code{g++},\n+and so on, which are small) and the documentation\n+is overwritten by the new installation.\n+The rest of the new installation is done without\n+replacing existing installed versions (assuming\n+they have different version numbers).\n \n @item @code{patch}\n Although you can do everything
