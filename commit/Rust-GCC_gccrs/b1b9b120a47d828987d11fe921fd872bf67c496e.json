This can be reverted\n   with -fpermissive, and is overridden by -pedantic or -pedantic-errors.\n \n+* String constants are now of type `const char[n]', rather than `char[n]'.\n+  This can be reverted with -fno-const-strings.\n+\n+* References to functions are now supported.\n+\n+* Lookup of class members during class definition now works in all cases.\n+\n+* In overload resolution, type conversion operators are now properly\n+  treated as always coming from the most derived class.\n+\n+* C9x-style restricted pointers are supported, using the `__restrict'\n+  keyword.\n+\n+* You can now use -fno-implicit-inline-templates to suppress writing out\n+  implicit instantiations of inline templates.  Normally we do write them\n+  out, even with -fno-implicit-templates, so that optimization doesn't\n+  affect which instantiations are needed.\n+\n+* -fstrict-prototype now also suppresses implicit declarations.\n+\n+* Many obsolete options have been removed: -fall-virtual, -fmemoize-lookups,\n+  -fsave-memoized, +e?, -fenum-int-equivalence, -fno-nonnull-objects.\n+\n+* Unused virtual functions can be discarded on some targets by specifying\n+  -ffunction-sections -fvtable-gc to the compiler and --gc-sections to the\n+  linker.  Unfortunately, this only works on Linux if you're linking\n+  statically.\n+\n+* Lots of bugs stomped.\n+\n *** Changes in EGCS 1.1:\n \n * Namespaces are fully supported.
