Software Foundation, Inc\n-https://fsf.org/\n-\n-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\n-license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n-\n-**Preamble**\n-\n-The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\n-functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to\n-assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\n-with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.\n-Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\n-to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible\n-for modifications made by others.\n-\n-This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative\n-works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\n-complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\n-license designed for free software.\n-\n-We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\n-software, because free software needs free documentation: a free\n-program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\n-software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\n-it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\n-whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\n-principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n-\n-**1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS**\n-\n-This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\n-contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\n-distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\n-world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\n-work under the conditions stated herein.  The **Document**, below,\n-refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\n-licensee, and is addressed as \"**you**\".  You accept the license if you\n-copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission\n-under copyright law.\n-\n-A \"**Modified Version**\" of the Document means any work containing the\n-Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\n-modifications and/or translated into another language.\n-\n-A \"**Secondary Section**\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\n-the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\n-publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject\n-(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\n-within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a\n-textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\n-mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\n-connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\n-commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\n-them.\n-\n-The \"**Invariant Sections**\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\n-are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\n-that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a\n-section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\n-allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero\n-Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant\n-Sections then there are none.\n-\n-The \"**Cover Texts**\" are certain short passages of text that are listed,\n-as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\n-the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may\n-be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n-\n-A \"**Transparent**\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\n-represented in a format whose specification is available to the\n-general public, that is suitable for revising the document\n-straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\n-pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\n-drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\n-for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\n-to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\n-format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\n-or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\n-An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\n-of text.  A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called **Opaque**.\n-\n-Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\n-ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\n-or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\n-HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of\n-transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats\n-include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by\n-proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or\n-processing tools are not generally available, and the\n-machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word\n-processors for output purposes only.\n-\n-The \"**Title Page**\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\n-plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\n-this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\n-formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means\n-the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\n-preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n-\n-The \"**publisher**\" means any person or entity that distributes\n-copies of the Document to the public.\n-\n-A section \"**Entitled XYZ**\" means a named subunit of the Document whose\n-title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\n-text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\n-specific section name mentioned below, such as \"**Acknowledgements**\",\n-\"**Dedications**\", \"**Endorsements**\", or \"**History**\".)\n-To \"**Preserve the Title**\"\n-of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\n-section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.\n-\n-The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\n-states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\n-Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this\n-License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\n-implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\n-no effect on the meaning of this License.\n-\n-**2. VERBATIM COPYING**\n-\n-You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\n-commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\n-copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\n-to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\n-conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\n-technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\n-copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\n-compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\n-number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n-\n-You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\n-you may publicly display copies.\n-\n-**3. COPYING IN QUANTITY**\n-\n-If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\n-printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\n-Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the\n-copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\n-Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\n-the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\n-you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\n-the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\n-visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\n-Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\n-the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\n-as verbatim copying in other respects.\n-\n-If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\n-legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\n-reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\n-pages.\n-\n-If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\n-more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\n-copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\n-a computer-network location from which the general network-using\n-public has access to download using public-standard network protocols\n-a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\n-If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,\n-when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure\n-that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\n-location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an\n-Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\n-edition to the public.\n-\n-It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\n-Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\n-them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n-\n-**4. MODIFICATIONS**\n-\n-You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\n-the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\n-the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\n-Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\n-and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\n-of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n-\n-A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\n-   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n-   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\n-   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\n-   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n-\n-B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n-   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\n-   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\n-   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),\n-   unless they release you from this requirement.\n-\n-C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\n-   Modified Version, as the publisher.\n-\n-D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n-\n-E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\n-   adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n-\n-F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\n-   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\n-   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n-\n-G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\n-   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\n-H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n-\n-I. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add\n-   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\n-   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\n-   there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one\n-   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\n-   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\n-   Version as stated in the previous sentence.\n-\n-J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\n-   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\n-   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\n-   it was based on.  These may be placed in the \"History\" section.\n-   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\n-   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\n-   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n-\n-K. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\",\n-   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all\n-   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\n-   and/or dedications given therein.\n-\n-L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\n-   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\n-   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\n-\n-M. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\".  Such a section\n-   may not be included in the Modified Version.\n-\n-N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\"\n-   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\n-\n-O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n-\n-If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\n-appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\n-copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\n-of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\n-list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\n-These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n-\n-You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\n-nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\n-parties---for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\n-been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\n-standard.\n-\n-You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\n-passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\n-of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\n-Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\n-through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\n-includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\n-by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\n-you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\n-permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n-\n-The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\n-give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\n-imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n-\n-**5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS**\n-\n-You may combine the Document with other documents released under this\n-License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\n-versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\n-Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\n-list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\n-license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n-\n-The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\n-multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\n-copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\n-different contents, make the title of each such section unique by\n-adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\n-author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\n-Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\n-Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n-\n-In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\"\n-in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\n-\"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\n-and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\".  You must delete all sections\n-Entitled \"Endorsements\".\n-\n-**6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS**\n-\n-You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\n-released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\n-License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\n-the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\n-verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n-\n-You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\n-it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\n-License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all\n-other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n-\n-**7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS**\n-\n-A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\n-and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\n-distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright\n-resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights\n-of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.\n-When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not\n-apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\n-derivative works of the Document.\n-\n-If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\n-copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\n-the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\n-covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\n-electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\n-Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole\n-aggregate.\n-\n-**8. TRANSLATION**\n-\n-Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\n-distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\n-Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\n-permission from their copyright holders, but you may include\n-translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\n-original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\n-translation of this License, and all the license notices in the\n-Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\n-the original English version of this License and the original versions\n-of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between\n-the translation and the original version of this License or a notice\n-or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n-\n-If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\n-\"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\n-its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual\n-title.\n-\n-**9. TERMINATION**\n-\n-You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document\n-except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n-otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and\n-will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n-\n-However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\n-from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\n-unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\n-terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder\n-fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to\n-60 days after the cessation.\n-\n-Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n-reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n-violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n-received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n-copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n-your receipt of the notice.\n-\n-Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n-licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n-this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n-reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does\n-not give you any rights to use it.\n-\n-**10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE**\n-\n-The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions\n-of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new\n-versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n-differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See\n-https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\n-\n-Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\n-If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\n-License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of\n-following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\n-of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\n-Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\n-number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\n-as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document\n-specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this\n-License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a\n-version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the\n-Document.\n-\n-**11. RELICENSING**\n-\n-\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any\n-World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also\n-provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A\n-public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A\n-\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the\n-site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC\n-site.\n-\n-\"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\n-license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit\n-corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,\n-California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license\n-published by that same organization.\n-\n-\"Incorporate\" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or\n-in part, as part of another Document.\n-\n-An MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this\n-License, and if all works that were first published under this License\n-somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole\n-or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,\n-and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\n-\n-The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site\n-under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,\n-provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.\n-\n-**ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents**\n-\n-To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\n-the License in the document and put the following copyright and\n-license notices just after the title page:\n-\n-    Copyright \u00a9 YEAR  YOUR NAME.\n-    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\n-    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3\n-    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\n-    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\n-    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU\n-    Free Documentation License\".\n-\n-\n-If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\n-replace the \"with ... Texts.\" line with this:\n-\n-    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\n-    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n-\n-If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other\n-combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the\n-situation.\n-\n-If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\n-recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of\n-free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,\n-to permit their use in free software."}, {"sha": "71a26e526277d45d0cf0160634d86a76804425be", "filename": "gcc/ada/gcc-interface/Make-lang.in", "status": "modified", "additions": 41, "deletions": 57, "changes": 98, "blob_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/0a543515957ff47feba739e6f71062fb2fb99125/gcc%2Fada%2Fgcc-interface%2FMake-lang.in", "raw_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/raw/0a543515957ff47feba739e6f71062fb2fb99125/gcc%2Fada%2Fgcc-interface%2FMake-lang.in", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/contents/gcc%2Fada%2Fgcc-interface%2FMake-lang.in?ref=0a543515957ff47feba739e6f71062fb2fb99125", "patch": "@@ -808,32 +808,24 @@ ada.tags: force\n \n # Generate documentation.\n \n-doc/gnat_ugn.info: ada/gnat_ugn.texi \\\n-   $(gcc_docdir)/include/fdl.texi $(gcc_docdir)/include/gcc-common.texi\t\\\n-   gcc-vers.texi\n-\tif [ x$(BUILD_INFO) = xinfo ];

For a\n-sequence of subprogram specs, a general alphabetical sorting is also\n-usually appropriate, but occasionally it makes sense to group by major\n-function, with appropriate headers.\n-\n-@item \n-All subprograms have a header giving the function name, with the following\n-format:\n-\n-@example\n------------------\n--- My_Function --\n------------------\n-\n-procedure My_Function is\n-begin\n-  ...\n-end My_Function;\n-@end example\n-\n-Note that the name in the header is preceded by a single space,\n-not two spaces as for other comments. These headers are used on\n-nested subprograms as well as outer level subprograms. They may\n-also be used as headers for sections of comments, or collections\n-of declarations that are related.\n-\n-@item \n-Every subprogram body must have a preceding subprogram_declaration,\n-which includes proper client documentation so that you do not need to\n-read the subprogram body in order to understand what the subprogram does and\n-how to call it. All subprograms should be documented, without exceptions.\n-\n-@geindex Blank lines (in subprogram bodies)\n-\n-@item \n-A sequence of declarations may optionally be separated from the following\n-begin by a blank line.  Just as we optionally allow blank lines in general\n-between declarations, this blank line should be present only if it improves\n-readability. Generally we avoid this blank line if the declarative part is\n-small (one or two lines) and the body has no blank lines, and we include it\n-if the declarative part is long or if the body has blank lines.\n-\n-@item \n-If the declarations in a subprogram contain at least one nested\n-subprogram body, then just before the @code{begin} of the enclosing\n-subprogram, there is a comment line and a blank line:\n-\n-@example\n---  Start of processing for Enclosing_Subprogram\n-\n-begin\n-  ...\n-end Enclosing_Subprogram;\n-@end example\n-\n-@item \n-When nested subprograms are present, variables that are referenced by any\n-nested subprogram should precede the nested subprogram specs. For variables\n-that are not referenced by nested procedures, the declarations can either also\n-be before any of the nested subprogram specs (this is the old style, more\n-generally used). Or then can come just before the begin, with a header. The\n-following example shows the two possible styles:\n-\n-@example\n-procedure Style1 is\n-   Var_Referenced_In_Nested      : Integer;\n-   Var_Referenced_Only_In_Style1 : Integer;\n-\n-   proc Nested;\n-   --  Comments ...\n-\n-   ------------\n-   -- Nested --\n-   ------------\n-\n-   procedure Nested is\n-   begin\n-      ...\n-   end Nested;\n-\n---  Start of processing for Style1\n-\n-begin\n-   ...\n-end Style1;\n-\n-procedure Style2 is\n-   Var_Referenced_In_Nested : Integer;\n-\n-   proc Nested;\n-   --  Comments ...\n-\n-   ------------\n-   -- Nested --\n-   ------------\n-\n-   procedure Nested is\n-   begin\n-      ...\n-   end Nested;\n-\n-   --  Local variables\n-\n-   Var_Referenced_Only_In_Style2 : Integer;\n-\n---  Start of processing for Style2\n-\n-begin\n-   ...\n-end Style2;\n-@end example\n-\n-For new code, we generally prefer Style2, but we do not insist on\n-modifying all legacy occurrences of Style1, which is still much\n-more common in the sources.\n-@end itemize\n-\n-@node Packages and Visibility Rules,Program Structure and Compilation Issues,Subprograms,Top\n-@anchor{gnat-style packages-and-visibility-rules}@anchor{14}\n-@chapter Packages and Visibility Rules\n-\n-\n-\n-@itemize *\n-\n-@item \n-All program units and subprograms have their name at the end:\n-\n-@example\n-package P is\n-   ...\n-end P;\n-@end example\n-\n-@item \n-We will use the style of @code{use} -ing @code{with} -ed packages, with\n-the context clauses looking like:\n-\n-@geindex use clauses\n-\n-@example\n-with A; use A;\n-with B; use B;\n-@end example\n-\n-@item \n-Names declared in the visible part of packages should be\n-unique, to prevent name clashes when the packages are @code{use} d.\n-\n-@geindex Name clash avoidance\n-\n-@example\n-package Entity is\n-   type Entity_Kind is ...;\n-   ...\n-end Entity;\n-@end example\n-\n-@item \n-After the file header comment, the context clause and unit specification\n-should be the first thing in a program_unit.\n-\n-@item \n-Preelaborate, Pure and Elaborate_Body pragmas should be added right after the\n-package name, indented an extra level and using the parameterless form:\n-\n-@example\n-package Preelaborate_Package is\n-   pragma Preelaborate;\n-   ...\n-end Preelaborate_Package;\n-@end example\n-@end itemize\n-\n-@node Program Structure and Compilation Issues,Index,Packages and Visibility Rules,Top\n-@anchor{gnat-style program-structure-and-compilation-issues}@anchor{15}\n-@chapter Program Structure and Compilation Issues\n-\n-\n-\n-@itemize *\n-\n-@item \n-Every GNAT source file must be compiled with the @code{-gnatg}\n-switch to check the coding style.\n-(Note that you should look at\n-style.adb to see the lexical rules enforced by @code{-gnatg} ).\n-\n-@geindex -gnatg option (to gcc)\n-\n-@geindex style.adb file\n-\n-@item \n-Each source file should contain only one compilation unit.\n-\n-@item \n-Filenames should be 8 or fewer characters, followed by the @code{.adb}\n-extension for a body or @code{.ads} for a spec.\n-\n-@geindex File name length\n-\n-@item \n-Unit names should be distinct when \u2018krunch\u2019ed to 8 characters\n-(see krunch.ads) and the filenames should match the unit name,\n-except that they are all lower case.\n-\n-@geindex krunch.ads file\n-@end itemize\n-\n-@menu\n-* GNU Free Documentation License:: \n-\n-@end menu\n-\n-@node GNU Free Documentation License,,,Program Structure and Compilation Issues\n-@anchor{share/gnu_free_documentation_license doc}@anchor{16}@anchor{share/gnu_free_documentation_license gnu-fdl}@anchor{17}@anchor{share/gnu_free_documentation_license gnu-free-documentation-license}@anchor{18}\n-@section GNU Free Documentation License\n-\n-\n-Version 1.3, 3 November 2008\n-\n-Copyright  2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008  Free Software Foundation, Inc\n-@indicateurl{https://fsf.org/}\n-\n-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\n-license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n-\n-`Preamble'\n-\n-The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\n-functional and useful document \u201cfree\u201d in the sense of freedom: to\n-assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\n-with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.\n-Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\n-to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible\n-for modifications made by others.\n-\n-This License is a kind of \u201ccopyleft\u201d, which means that derivative\n-works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\n-complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\n-license designed for free software.\n-\n-We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\n-software, because free software needs free documentation: a free\n-program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\n-software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\n-it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\n-whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\n-principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n-\n-`1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS'\n-\n-This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\n-contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\n-distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\n-world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\n-work under the conditions stated herein.  The `Document', below,\n-refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\n-licensee, and is addressed as \u201c`you'\u201d.  You accept the license if you\n-copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission\n-under copyright law.\n-\n-A \u201c`Modified Version'\u201d of the Document means any work containing the\n-Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\n-modifications and/or translated into another language.\n-\n-A \u201c`Secondary Section'\u201d is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\n-the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\n-publishers or authors of the Document to the Document\u2019s overall subject\n-(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\n-within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a\n-textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\n-mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\n-connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\n-commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\n-them.\n-\n-The \u201c`Invariant Sections'\u201d are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\n-are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\n-that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a\n-section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\n-allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero\n-Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant\n-Sections then there are none.\n-\n-The \u201c`Cover Texts'\u201d are certain short passages of text that are listed,\n-as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\n-the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may\n-be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\n-\n-A \u201c`Transparent'\u201d copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\n-represented in a format whose specification is available to the\n-general public, that is suitable for revising the document\n-straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\n-pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\n-drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\n-for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\n-to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\n-format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\n-or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\n-An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\n-of text.  A copy that is not \u201cTransparent\u201d is called `Opaque'.\n-\n-Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\n-ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\n-or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\n-HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of\n-transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats\n-include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by\n-proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or\n-processing tools are not generally available, and the\n-machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word\n-processors for output purposes only.\n-\n-The \u201c`Title Page'\u201d means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\n-plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\n-this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\n-formats which do not have any title page as such, \u201cTitle Page\u201d means\n-the text near the most prominent appearance of the work\u2019s title,\n-preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n-\n-The \u201c`publisher'\u201d means any person or entity that distributes\n-copies of the Document to the public.\n-\n-A section \u201c`Entitled XYZ'\u201d means a named subunit of the Document whose\n-title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\n-text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\n-specific section name mentioned below, such as \u201c`Acknowledgements'\u201d,\n-\u201c`Dedications'\u201d, \u201c`Endorsements'\u201d, or \u201c`History'\u201d.)\n-To \u201c`Preserve the Title'\u201d\n-of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\n-section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d according to this definition.\n-\n-The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\n-states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\n-Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this\n-License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\n-implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\n-no effect on the meaning of this License.\n-\n-`2. VERBATIM COPYING'\n-\n-You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\n-commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\n-copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\n-to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\n-conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\n-technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\n-copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\n-compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\n-number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n-\n-You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\n-you may publicly display copies.\n-\n-`3. COPYING IN QUANTITY'\n-\n-If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\n-printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\n-Document\u2019s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the\n-copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\n-Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\n-the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\n-you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\n-the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\n-visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\n-Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\n-the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\n-as verbatim copying in other respects.\n-\n-If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\n-legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\n-reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\n-pages.\n-\n-If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\n-more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\n-copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\n-a computer-network location from which the general network-using\n-public has access to download using public-standard network protocols\n-a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\n-If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,\n-when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure\n-that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\n-location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an\n-Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\n-edition to the public.\n-\n-It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\n-Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\n-them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n-\n-`4. MODIFICATIONS'\n-\n-You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\n-the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\n-the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\n-Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\n-and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\n-of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n-\n-\n-@enumerate A\n-\n-@item \n-Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\n-from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n-(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\n-of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\n-if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n-\n-@item \n-List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n-responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\n-Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\n-Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),\n-unless they release you from this requirement.\n-\n-@item \n-State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\n-Modified Version, as the publisher.\n-\n-@item \n-Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n-\n-@item \n-Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\n-adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n-\n-@item \n-Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\n-giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\n-terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n-\n-@item \n-Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\n-and required Cover Texts given in the Document\u2019s license notice.\n-\n-@item \n-Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n-\n-@item \n-Preserve the section Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d, Preserve its Title, and add\n-to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\n-publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\n-there is no section Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d in the Document, create one\n-stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\n-given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\n-Version as stated in the previous sentence.\n-\n-@item \n-Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\n-public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\n-the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\n-it was based on.  These may be placed in the \u201cHistory\u201d section.\n-You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\n-least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\n-publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n-\n-@item \n-For any section Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d or \u201cDedications\u201d,\n-Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all\n-the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\n-and/or dedications given therein.\n-\n-@item \n-Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\n-unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\n-or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\n-\n-@item \n-Delete any section Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d.  Such a section\n-may not be included in the Modified Version.\n-\n-@item \n-Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d\n-or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\n-\n-@item \n-Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n-@end enumerate\n-\n-If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\n-appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\n-copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\n-of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\n-list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version\u2019s license notice.\n-These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n-\n-You may add a section Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d, provided it contains\n-nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\n-parties\u2014for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\n-been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\n-standard.\n-\n-You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\n-passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\n-of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\n-Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\n-through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\n-includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\n-by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\n-you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\n-permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n-\n-The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\n-give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\n-imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n-\n-`5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS'\n-\n-You may combine the Document with other documents released under this\n-License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\n-versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\n-Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\n-list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\n-license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\n-\n-The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\n-multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\n-copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\n-different contents, make the title of each such section unique by\n-adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\n-author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\n-Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\n-Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n-\n-In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d\n-in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\n-\u201cHistory\u201d; likewise combine any sections Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d,\n-and any sections Entitled \u201cDedications\u201d.  You must delete all sections\n-Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d.\n-\n-`6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS'\n-\n-You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\n-released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\n-License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\n-the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\n-verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n-\n-You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\n-it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\n-License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all\n-other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n-\n-`7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS'\n-\n-A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\n-and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\n-distribution medium, is called an \u201caggregate\u201d if the copyright\n-resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights\n-of the compilation\u2019s users beyond what the individual works permit.\n-When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not\n-apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\n-derivative works of the Document.\n-\n-If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\n-copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\n-the entire aggregate, the Document\u2019s Cover Texts may be placed on\n-covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\n-electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\n-Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole\n-aggregate.\n-\n-`8. TRANSLATION'\n-\n-Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\n-distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\n-Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\n-permission from their copyright holders, but you may include\n-translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\n-original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\n-translation of this License, and all the license notices in the\n-Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\n-the original English version of this License and the original versions\n-of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between\n-the translation and the original version of this License or a notice\n-or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\n-\n-If a section in the Document is Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d,\n-\u201cDedications\u201d, or \u201cHistory\u201d, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\n-its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual\n-title.\n-\n-`9. TERMINATION'\n-\n-You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document\n-except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n-otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and\n-will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n-\n-However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\n-from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\n-unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\n-terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder\n-fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to\n-60 days after the cessation.\n-\n-Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n-reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n-violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n-received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n-copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n-your receipt of the notice.\n-\n-Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n-licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n-this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n-reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does\n-not give you any rights to use it.\n-\n-`10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE'\n-\n-The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions\n-of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new\n-versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n-differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See\n-@indicateurl{https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/}.\n-\n-Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\n-If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\n-License \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of\n-following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\n-of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\n-Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\n-number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\n-as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document\n-specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this\n-License can be used, that proxy\u2019s public statement of acceptance of a\n-version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the\n-Document.\n-\n-`11.
