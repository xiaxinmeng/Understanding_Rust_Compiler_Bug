Secondarily,\n-this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get\n-credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for\n-modifications made by others.\n-\n-This License is a kind of ``copyleft'', which means that derivative\n-works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\n-complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\n-license designed for free software.\n-\n-We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\n-software, because free software needs free documentation: a free\n-program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\n-software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\n-it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\n-whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\n-principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n-\n-@item\n-APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n-\n-This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a\n-notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed\n-under the terms of this License.  The ``Document'', below, refers to any\n-such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is\n-addressed as ``you''.\n-\n-A ``Modified Version'' of the Document means any work containing the\n-Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\n-modifications and/or translated into another language.\n-\n-A ``Secondary Section'' is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\n-the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\n-publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject\n-(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\n-within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a\n-textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\n-mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\n-connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\n-commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\n-them.\n-\n-The ``Invariant Sections'' are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\n-are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\n-that says that the Document is released under this License.\n-\n-The ``Cover Texts'' are certain short passages of text that are listed,\n-as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\n-the Document is released under this License.\n-\n-A ``Transparent'' copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\n-represented in a format whose specification is available to the\n-general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and\n-straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\n-pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\n-drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\n-for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\n-to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\n-format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage\n-subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is\n-not ``Transparent'' is called ``Opaque''.\n-\n-Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\n-@sc{ascii} without markup, Texinfo input format, La@TeX{} input format,\n-@acronym{SGML} or @acronym{XML} using a publicly available\n-@acronym{DTD}, and standard-conforming simple @acronym{HTML} designed\n-for human modification.  Opaque formats include PostScript,\n-@acronym{PDF}, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by\n-proprietary word processors, @acronym{SGML} or @acronym{XML} for which\n-the @acronym{DTD} and/or processing tools are not generally available,\n-and the machine-generated @acronym{HTML} produced by some word\n-processors for output purposes only.\n-\n-The ``Title Page'' means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\n-plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\n-this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\n-formats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page'' means\n-the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\n-preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n-\n-@item\n-VERBATIM COPYING\n-\n-You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\n-commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\n-copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\n-to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\n-conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\n-technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\n-copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\n-compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\n-number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n-\n-You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\n-you may publicly display copies.\n-\n-@item\n-COPYING IN QUANTITY\n-\n-If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,\n-and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose\n-the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\n-Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\n-the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\n-you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\n-the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\n-visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\n-Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\n-the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\n-as verbatim copying in other respects.\n-\n-If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\n-legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\n-reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\n-pages.\n-\n-If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\n-more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\n-copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\n-a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete\n-Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the\n-general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no\n-charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter\n-option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\n-distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this\n-Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location\n-until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque\n-copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to\n-the public.\n-\n-It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\n-Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\n-them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n-\n-@item\n-MODIFICATIONS\n-\n-You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\n-the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\n-the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\n-Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\n-and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\n-of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n-\n-@enumerate A\n-@item\n-Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\n-from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n-(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\n-of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\n-if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n-\n-@item\n-List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n-responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\n-Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\n-Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).\n-\n-@item\n-State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\n-Modified Version, as the publisher.\n-\n-@item\n-Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n-\n-@item\n-Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\n-adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n-\n-@item\n-Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\n-giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\n-terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n-\n-@item\n-Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\n-and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\n-\n-@item\n-Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n-\n-@item\n-Preserve the section entitled ``History'', and its title, and add to\n-it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\n-publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\n-there is no section entitled ``History'' in the Document, create one\n-stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\n-given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\n-Version as stated in the previous sentence.\n-\n-@item\n-Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\n-public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\n-the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\n-it was based on.  These may be placed in the ``History'' section.\n-You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\n-least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\n-publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n-\n-@item\n-In any section entitled ``Acknowledgments'' or ``Dedications'',\n-preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the\n-substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgments\n-and/or dedications given therein.\n-\n-@item\n-Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\n-unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\n-or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\n-\n-@item\n-Delete any section entitled ``Endorsements''.  Such a section\n-may not be included in the Modified Version.\n-\n-@item\n-Do not retitle any existing section as ``Endorsements''\n-or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\n-@end enumerate\n-\n-If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\n-appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\n-copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\n-of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\n-list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\n-These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n-\n-You may add a section entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it contains\n-nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\n-parties---for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\n-been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\n-standard.\n-\n-You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\n-passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\n-of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\n-Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\n-through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\n-includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\n-by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\n-you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\n-permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n-\n-The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\n-give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\n-imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n-\n-@item\n-COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n-\n-You may combine the Document with other documents released under this\n-License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\n-versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\n-Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\n-list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\n-license notice.\n-\n-The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\n-multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\n-copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\n-different contents, make the title of each such section unique by\n-adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\n-author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\n-Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\n-Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n-\n-In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled ``History''\n-in the various original documents, forming one section entitled\n-``History''; likewise combine any sections entitled ``Acknowledgments'',\n-and any sections entitled ``Dedications''.  You must delete all sections\n-entitled ``Endorsements.''\n-\n-@item\n-COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n-\n-You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\n-released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\n-License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\n-the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\n-verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n-\n-You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\n-it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\n-License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all\n-other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n-\n-@item\n-AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n-\n-A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\n-and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\n-distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version\n-of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the\n-compilation.  Such a compilation is called an ``aggregate'', and this\n-License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled\n-with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they\n-are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n-\n-If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\n-copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter\n-of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\n-covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.\n-Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.\n-\n-@item\n-TRANSLATION\n-\n-Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\n-distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\n-Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\n-permission from their copyright holders, but you may include\n-translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\n-original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\n-translation of this License provided that you also include the\n-original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement\n-between the translation and the original English version of this\n-License, the original English version will prevail.\n-\n-@item\n-TERMINATION\n-\n-You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\n-as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to\n-copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will\n-automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,\n-parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\n-License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n-parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-@item\n-FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n-\n-The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions\n-of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new\n-versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n-differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See\n-@uref{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/}.\n-\n-Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\n-If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\n-License ``or any later version'' applies to it, you have the option of\n-following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\n-of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\n-Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\n-number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\n-as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.\n-@end enumerate\n-\n-@page\n-@subsection ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\n-\n-To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\n-the License in the document and put the following copyright and\n-license notices just after the title page:\n-\n-@smallexample\n-@group\n-  Copyright (C)  @var{year}  @var{your name}.\n-  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\n-  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1\n-  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\n-  with the Invariant Sections being @var{list their titles}, with the\n-  Front-Cover Texts being @var{list}, and with the Back-Cover Texts being @var{list}.\n-  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU\n-  Free Documentation License''.\n-@end group\n-@end smallexample\n-\n-If you have no Invariant Sections, write ``with no Invariant Sections''\n-instead of saying which ones are invariant.
