There are probably lots of other things that should be\n+explained in this HACKING file. Please add them if you discover them :)\n+\n+--\n+\n+A lot of the standard library files come from the GNU Classpath project.\n+<http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/>\n+The libgcj and Classpath project have officially merged, but the merge\n+is not yet complete. Our eventual goal is for Classpath to be an upstream\n+source provider for libgcj, however it will be some time before this becomes\n+reality: libgcj and Classpath have different implementations of many core\n+java classes. In order to merge them, we need to select the best (most\n+efficient, cleanest) implementation of each method/class/package, resolve\n+any conflicts created by the merge, and test the final result.\n+\n+The merged files can be recognized by the standard Classpath copyright\n+comments at the top of the file. If you make changes to these files then\n+you should also send a patch to the classpath mailinglist.\n+<http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/classpath/>\n+<mailto:classpath@gnu.org>\n+\n+If you merge a libgcj class with a classpath class then you must update the\n+copyright notice at the top of the file so others can see that this is a\n+shared libgcj/classpath file.\n+\n+--\n+\n+If you need to add new java files to libgcj then you have to edit the\n+Makefile.am file in the top (libjava) directory. And run automake.\n+But note the following (thanks to Bryce McKinlay):\n+\n+> Do you know the magic dance I have to do when adding files to Makefile.am\n+> so they will appear in Makefile.in and finally in the user generated\n+> Makefile?\n+Yup, you need the magic libgcj automake ;-)\n+\n+<ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/.0/sourceware/java/automake-gcj-1.4.tar.gz>\n+\n+Install that (dont worry, it should still work for other projects), add your\n+files to the Makefile.am, then just type \"automake\" and it will regenerate the\n+Makefile.in. Easy!\n+"}]}
