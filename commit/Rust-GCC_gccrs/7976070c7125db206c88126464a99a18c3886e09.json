Some platforms can place each function and variable into its\n    own section in a .o file. The GNU linker can then perform garbage\n    collection on unused sections; this reduces the situation to only\n    copying needed functions into the executable, as before, but all\n    happens automatically.\n-   \n+\n    Unfortunately the garbage collection in GNU ld is buggy; sections\n    (corresponding to functions and variables) which are used are\n    mistakenly removed, leading to horrible crashes when your executable\n    starts up. For the time being, this feature is not used when building\n    the library.\n      _________________________________________________________________\n-   \n+\n                          3.0 Platform-Specific Issues\n-                                       \n+\n 3.1 Can libstdc++-v3 be used with <my favorite compiler>?\n \n    Probably not.

Configuring and building the library\n    (see above) will still require certain tools, however. Also keep in\n    mind that building libstdc++ does not imply that your compiler will be\n    able to use all of the features found in the C++ Standard Library.\n-   \n+\n    Since the goal of ISO Standardization is for all C++ implementations\n    to be able to share code, the final libstdc++ should, in theory, be\n    usable under any ISO-compliant compiler. It will still be targeted and\n    optimized for GCC/g++, however.\n      _________________________________________________________________\n-   \n+\n 3.2 [removed]\n \n    This question has become moot and has been removed.

This requires\n    that certain functions from your C library be present.\n-   \n+\n    Up through release 3.0.2 the tests performed were too general, and\n    this feature was disabled when it did not need to be. The most\n    commonly reported platform affected was Solaris.\n-   \n+\n    This has been fixed for 3.0.3 and onwards.\n      _________________________________________________________________\n-   \n+\n 3.5 _XOPEN_SOURCE / _GNU_SOURCE / etc is always defined\n \n    On Solaris, g++ (but not gcc) always defines the preprocessor macro\n    _XOPEN_SOURCE. On GNU/Linux, the same happens with _GNU_SOURCE. (This\n    is not an exhaustive list; other macros and other platforms are also\n    affected.)\n-   \n+\n    These macros are typically used in C library headers, guarding new\n    versions of functions from their older versions. The C++ standard\n    library includes the C standard library, but it requires the C90\n    version, which for backwards-compatability reasons is often not the\n    default for many vendors.\n-   \n+\n    More to the point, the C++ standard requires behavior which is only\n    available on certain platforms after certain symbols are defined.\n    Usually the issue involves I/O-related typedefs. In order to ensure\n    correctness, the compiler simply predefines those symbols.\n-   \n+\n    Note that it's not enough to #define them only when the library is\n    being built (during installation). Since we don't have an 'export'\n    keyword, much of the library exists as headers, which means that the\n    symbols must also be defined as your programs are parsed and compiled.\n-   \n+\n    To see which symbols are defined, look for CPLUSPLUS_CPP_SPEC in the\n    gcc config headers for your target (and try changing them to see what\n    happens when building complicated code).
