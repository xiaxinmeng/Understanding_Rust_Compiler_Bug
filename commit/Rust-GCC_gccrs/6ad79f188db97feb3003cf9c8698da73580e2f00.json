GCC is an integrated\n+distribution of compilers for several major programming languages.  These\n+languages currently include C, C++, Objective-C, Java, Fortran, and Ada.\n+\n+The abbreviation @dfn{GCC} has multiple meanings in common use.  The\n+current official meaning is ``GNU Compiler Collection'', which refers\n+generically to the complete suite of tools.  The name historically stood\n+for ``GNU C Compiler'', and this usage is still common when the emphasis\n+is on compiling C programs.

In addition to the front ends that are\n+integrated components of GCC, there are several other front ends that\n+are maintained separately.  These support languages such as Pascal,\n+Mercury, and COBOL.  To use these, they must be built together with\n+GCC proper.\n \n @cindex C++\n @cindex G++\n-When referring to C++ compilation, it is usual to call the compiler\n-``G++''.  Since there is only one compiler, it is also accurate to call\n-it ``GCC'' no matter what the language context; however, the term\n-``G++'' is more useful when the emphasis is on compiling C++ programs.\n-\n @cindex Ada\n @cindex GNAT\n-Similarly, when we talk about Ada compilation, we usually call the\n-compiler ``GNAT'', for the same reasons.\n-\n-We use the name ``GCC'' to refer to the compilation system as a\n-whole, and more specifically to the language-independent part of the\n-compiler.  For example, we refer to the optimization options as\n-affecting the behavior of ``GCC'' or sometimes just ``the compiler''.\n-\n-Front ends for other languages, such as Mercury and Pascal exist but\n-have not yet been integrated into GCC@.  These front ends, like that for C++,\n-are built in subdirectories of GCC and link to it.  The result is an\n-integrated compiler that can compile programs written in C, C++,\n-Objective-C, or any of the languages for which you have installed front\n-ends.\n-\n-In this manual, we only discuss the options for the C, Objective-C, and\n-C++ compilers and those of the GCC core.  Consult the documentation\n-of the other front ends for the options to use when compiling programs\n-written in other languages.\n+Most of the compilers for languages other than C have their own names.\n+The C++ compiler is G++, the Ada compiler is GNAT, and so on.  When we\n+talk about compiling one of those languages, we might refer to that\n+compiler by its own name, or as GCC@.

G++ builds object\n-code directly from your C++ program source.  There is no intermediate C\n-version of the program.  (By contrast, for example, some other\n-implementations use a program that generates a C program from your C++\n-source.)  Avoiding an intermediate C representation of the program means\n-that you get better object code, and better debugging information.  The\n-GNU debugger, GDB, works with this information in the object code to\n-give you comprehensive C++ source-level editing capabilities\n-(@pxref{C,,C and C++,gdb.info, Debugging with GDB}).\n-\n-@c FIXME!
