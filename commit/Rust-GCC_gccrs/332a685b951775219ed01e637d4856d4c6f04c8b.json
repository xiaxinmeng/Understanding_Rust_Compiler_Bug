I get this a lot for valid tests so I ignored it.  I get it\non OSX because at the moment something is going on with 'expect' on OSX\nerronously reporting errors that aren't really errors.  This is currently\nunder investigation (it may be some kind of buffer/race condition).\n\nFrom-SVN: r48821", "tree": {"sha": "b8c2857f08157a87815d12cacd5bd64a4dfa2f6f", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/git/trees/b8c2857f08157a87815d12cacd5bd64a4dfa2f6f"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/git/commits/332a685b951775219ed01e637d4856d4c6f04c8b", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/332a685b951775219ed01e637d4856d4c6f04c8b", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commit/332a685b951775219ed01e637d4856d4c6f04c8b", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/332a685b951775219ed01e637d4856d4c6f04c8b/comments", "author": null, "committer": null, "parents": [{"sha": "61d477875a82053267bff6d3ad08f193c677f9d7", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/61d477875a82053267bff6d3ad08f193c677f9d7", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commit/61d477875a82053267bff6d3ad08f193c677f9d7"}], "stats": {"total": 4, "additions": 2, "deletions": 2}, "files": [{"sha": "c4c4642688f61a126ec77b128c87b26646e7b5d4", "filename": "gcc/testsuite/g++.dg/other/deprecated.C", "status": "modified", "additions": 2, "deletions": 2, "changes": 4, "blob_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/332a685b951775219ed01e637d4856d4c6f04c8b/gcc%2Ftestsuite%2Fg%2B%2B.dg%2Fother%2Fdeprecated.C", "raw_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/raw/332a685b951775219ed01e637d4856d4c6f04c8b/gcc%2Ftestsuite%2Fg%2B%2B.dg%2Fother%2Fdeprecated.C", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/contents/gcc%2Ftestsuite%2Fg%2B%2B.dg%2Fother%2Fdeprecated.C?ref=332a685b951775219ed01e637d4856d4c6f04c8b", "patch": "@@ -98,11 +98,11 @@ class T {\n     int x;\n } __attribute__ ((deprecated));\n \n-T *p2;\n+T *p3;\n \n inline void T::member1(int) {}\n \n-int T::member2(T *p)\n+int T::member3(T *p)\n {\n   p->member1(1);\t\t\t/* { dg-warning \"`member1' is deprecated\" \"\" } */\n   (*p).member1(2);\t\t\t/* { dg-warning \"`member1' is deprecated\" \"\" } */"}]}
