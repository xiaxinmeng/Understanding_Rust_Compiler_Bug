They would need an explicit @ingroup tag added to them\nindividually. With GROUP_NESTED_COMPOUNDS=YES they get added to the\nenclosing group.\n\nThe SORT_BY_SCOPE_NAME option means that the list of classes will sort\nby class name, not the full qualified-id. Currently the alphabetical\nClass List for classes beginning with 'c' looks like:\n\n  char_traits (__gnu_cxx)\n  character (__gnu_cxx)\n  condition_base (__gnu_cxx)\n  const_iterator_\n  condition_variable_any (std::_V2)\n  cauchy_distribution (std)\n  char_traits (std)\n\ni.e. the list is sorted by the namespaces first, then the class names.\nThis is not helpful when you don't know which namespace a class might be\nin, and inline namespaces with reserved names are not hidden (see\nhttps://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/issues/5914 for a feature request to\nallow that).\n\nWith SORT_BY_SCOPE_NAME=NO the list looks like:\n\n  cauchy_distribution (std)\n  char_traits (__gnu_cxx)\n  char_traits (std)\n  character (__gnu_cxx)\n  condition_base (__gnu_cxx)\n  condition_variable_any (std::_V2)\n  const_iterator_\n\nThis allows you to find a class by name more easily.\n\nAlso add PREDEFINED macros so that __attribute__ and various macros like\n_GLIBCXX_NO_DISCARD, _GLIBCXX14_CONSTEXPR don't appear in the generated\ndocs.\n\n\t* doc/doxygen/user.cfg.in: Regenerate with Doxygen 1.8.14 and set\n\tGROUP_NESTED_COMPOUNDS=YES and SORT_BY_SCOPE_NAME=NO.
