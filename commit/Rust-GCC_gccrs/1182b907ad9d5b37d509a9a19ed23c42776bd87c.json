A plain-text version of the\n+manual page is available as bzip2.txt.\n+\n+\n+HOW TO BUILD -- UNIX\n+\n+Type 'make'.  This builds the library libbz2.a and then the programs\n+bzip2 and bzip2recover.  Six self-tests are run.  If the self-tests\n+complete ok, carry on to installation:\n+\n+To install in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/man and\n+/usr/local/include, type\n+\n+   make install\n+\n+To install somewhere else, eg, /xxx/yyy/{bin,lib,man,include}, type\n+\n+   make install PREFIX=/xxx/yyy\n+\n+If you are (justifiably) paranoid and want to see what 'make install'\n+is going to do, you can first do\n+\n+   make -n install                      or\n+   make -n install PREFIX=/xxx/yyy      respectively.\n+\n+The -n instructs make to show the commands it would execute, but not\n+actually execute them.\n+\n+\n+HOW TO BUILD -- UNIX, shared library libbz2.so.\n+\n+Do 'make -f Makefile-libbz2_so'.  This Makefile seems to work for\n+Linux-ELF (RedHat 7.2 on an x86 box), with gcc.  I make no claims\n+that it works for any other platform, though I suspect it probably\n+will work for most platforms employing both ELF and gcc.\n+\n+bzip2-shared, a client of the shared library, is also built, but not\n+self-tested.  So I suggest you also build using the normal Makefile,\n+since that conducts a self-test.  A second reason to prefer the\n+version statically linked to the library is that, on x86 platforms,\n+building shared objects makes a valuable register (%ebx) unavailable\n+to gcc, resulting in a slowdown of 10%-20%, at least for bzip2.\n+\n+Important note for people upgrading .so's from 0.9.0/0.9.5 to version\n+1.0.X.  All the functions in the library have been renamed, from (eg)\n+bzCompress to BZ2_bzCompress, to avoid namespace pollution.\n+Unfortunately this means that the libbz2.so created by\n+Makefile-libbz2_so will not work with any program which used an older\n+version of the library.  I do encourage library clients to make the\n+effort to upgrade to use version 1.0, since it is both faster and more\n+robust than previous versions.\n+\n+\n+HOW TO BUILD -- Windows 95, NT, DOS, Mac, etc.\n+\n+It's difficult for me to support compilation on all these platforms.\n+My approach is to collect binaries for these platforms, and put them\n+on the master web site (http://www.bzip.org).  Look there.  However\n+(FWIW), bzip2-1.0.X is very standard ANSI C and should compile\n+unmodified with MS Visual C.  If you have difficulties building, you\n+might want to read README.COMPILATION.PROBLEMS.\n+\n+At least using MS Visual C++ 6, you can build from the unmodified\n+sources by issuing, in a command shell: \n+\n+   nmake -f makefile.msc\n+\n+(you may need to first run the MSVC-provided script VCVARS32.BAT\n+ so as to set up paths to the MSVC tools correctly).\n+\n+\n+VALIDATION\n+\n+Correct operation, in the sense that a compressed file can always be\n+decompressed to reproduce the original, is obviously of paramount\n+importance.  To validate bzip2, I used a modified version of Mark\n+Nelson's churn program.  Churn is an automated test driver which\n+recursively traverses a directory structure, using bzip2 to compress\n+and then decompress each file it encounters, and checking that the\n+decompressed data is the same as the original.\n+\n+\n+\n+Please read and be aware of the following:\n+\n+WARNING:\n+\n+   This program and library (attempts to) compress data by \n+   performing several non-trivial transformations on it.  \n+   Unless you are 100% familiar with *all* the algorithms \n+   contained herein, and with the consequences of modifying them, \n+   you should NOT meddle with the compression or decompression \n+   machinery.  Incorrect changes can and very likely *will* \n+   lead to disastrous loss of data.\n+\n+\n+DISCLAIMER:\n+\n+   I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA ARISING FROM THE\n+   USE OF THIS PROGRAM/LIBRARY, HOWSOEVER CAUSED.\n+\n+   Every compression of a file implies an assumption that the\n+   compressed file can be decompressed to reproduce the original.\n+   Great efforts in design, coding and testing have been made to\n+   ensure that this program works correctly.  However, the complexity\n+   of the algorithms, and, in particular, the presence of various\n+   special cases in the code which occur with very low but non-zero\n+   probability make it impossible to rule out the possibility of bugs\n+   remaining in the program.  DO NOT COMPRESS ANY DATA WITH THIS\n+   PROGRAM UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE POSSIBILITY, HOWEVER\n+   SMALL, THAT THE DATA WILL NOT BE RECOVERABLE.\n+\n+   That is not to say this program is inherently unreliable.  \n+   Indeed, I very much hope the opposite is true.  bzip2/libbzip2 \n+   has been carefully constructed and extensively tested.\n+\n+\n+PATENTS:\n+\n+   To the best of my knowledge, bzip2/libbzip2 does not use any \n+   patented algorithms.  However, I do not have the resources \n+   to carry out a patent search.  Therefore I cannot give any \n+   guarantee of the above statement.\n+\n+\n+\n+WHAT'S NEW IN 0.9.0 (as compared to 0.1pl2) ?\n+\n+   * Approx 10% faster compression, 30% faster decompression\n+   * -t (test mode) is a lot quicker\n+   * Can decompress concatenated compressed files\n+   * Programming interface, so programs can directly read/write .bz2 files\n+   * Less restrictive (BSD-style) licensing\n+   * Flag handling more compatible with GNU gzip\n+   * Much more documentation, i.e., a proper user manual\n+   * Hopefully, improved portability (at least of the library)\n+\n+WHAT'S NEW IN 0.9.5 ?\n+\n+   * Compression speed is much less sensitive to the input\n+     data than in previous versions.  Specifically, the very\n+     slow performance caused by repetitive data is fixed.\n+   * Many small improvements in file and flag handling.\n+   * A Y2K statement.\n+\n+WHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.0 ?\n+\n+   See the CHANGES file.\n+\n+WHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.2 ?\n+\n+   See the CHANGES file.\n+\n+WHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.3 ?\n+\n+   See the CHANGES file.\n+\n+WHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.4 ?\n+\n+   See the CHANGES file.\n+\n+WHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.5 ?\n+\n+   See the CHANGES file.\n+\n+WHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.6 ?\n+\n+   See the CHANGES file.\n+\n+\n+I hope you find bzip2 useful.
