Assert and Assert_Not are used to reduce the textual\n+--      overhead of the test-that-this-condition-is-(not)-true paradigm.\n+--      Touch and Validate are used to simplify tracing an expected path\n+--      of execution.\n+--      A tag comment of the form:\n+--\n+--      TCTouch.Touch( 'A' ); ----------------------------------------- A\n+--\n+--      is recommended to improve readability of this feature.\n+--\n+--      Report.Test must be called before any of the procedures in this\n+--      package with the exception of Touch.\n+--      The usage paradigm is to call Touch in locations in the test where you\n+--      want a trace of execution.  Each call to Touch should have a unique\n+--      character associated with it.  At each place where a check can\n+--      reasonably be performed to determine correct execution of a\n+--      sub-test, a call to Validate should be made.  The first parameter\n+--      passed to Validate is the expected string of characters produced by\n+--      call(s) to Touch in the subtest just executed.  The second parameter\n+--      is the message to pass to Report.Failed if the expected sequence was\n+--      not executed.\n+--\n+--      Validate should always be called after calls to Touch before a test\n+--      completes.\n+--\n+--      In the event that calls may have been made to Touch that are not\n+--      intended to be recorded, or, the failure of a previous subtest may\n+--      leave Touch calls \"Unvalidated\", the procedure Flush will reset the\n+--      tracker to the \"empty\" state.  Flush does not make any calls to\n+--      Report.\n+--\n+--      Calls to Assert and Assert_Not are to replace the idiom:\n+--\n+--         if BadCondition then  -- or if not PositiveTest then\n+--           Report.Failed(Message);\n+--         end if;\n+--\n+--      with:\n+--\n+--         Assert_Not( BadCondition, Message ); -- or\n+--         Assert( PositiveTest, Message );\n+--\n+--      Implementation_Check is for use with tests that cross the boundary\n+--      between the core and the Special Needs Annexes.  There are several\n+--      instances where language in the core becomes enforceable only when\n+--      a Special Needs Annex is supported.  Implementation_Check should be\n+--      called in place of Report.Failed in these cases; it examines the\n+--      constants in Impdef that indicate if the particular Special Needs\n+--      Annex is being validated with this validation; and acts accordingly.\n+--\n+--      The constant Foundation_ID contains the internal change version\n+--      for this software.\n+--\n+-- ERROR CONDITIONS:\n+--\n+--      It is an error to perform more than Max_Touch_Count (80) calls to\n+--      Touch without a subsequent call to Validate.  To do so will cause\n+--      a false test failure.\n+--\n+-- CHANGE HISTORY:\n+--     02 JUN 94   SAIC    Initial version\n+--     27 OCT 94   SAIC    Revised version\n+--     07 AUG 95   SAIC    Added Implementation_Check\n+--     07 FEB 96   SAIC    Changed to match new Impdef for 2.1\n+--     16 MAR 00   RLB     Changed foundation id to reflect test suite version.\n+--     22 MAR 01   RLB     Changed foundation id to reflect test suite version.\n+--     29 MAR 02   RLB     Changed foundation id to reflect test suite version.\n+--\n+--!\n+\n+package TCTouch is\n+  Foundation_ID   : constant String := \"TCTouch ACATS 2.5\";\n+  Max_Touch_Count : constant        := 80;\n+\n+  procedure Assert    ( SB_True  : Boolean; Message : String );\n+  procedure Assert_Not( SB_False : Boolean; Message : String );\n+\n+  procedure Touch   ( A_Tag   : Character );\n+  procedure Validate( Expected: String;\n+                      Message : String;\n+                      Order_Meaningful : Boolean := True );\n+\n+  procedure Flush;\n+\n+  type Special_Needs_Annexes is ( Annex_C, Annex_D, Annex_E,\n+                                  Annex_F, Annex_G, Annex_H );\n+\n+  procedure Implementation_Check( Message : in String;\n+                                  Annex   : in Special_Needs_Annexes\n+                                          := Annex_C );\n+    -- If Impdef.Validating_Annex_<Annex> is true, will call Report.Failed\n+    -- otherwise will call Report.Not_Applicable.

This program may need to\n+--      be modified if the Wide_Character representation recognized by\n+--      your compiler differs from the Wide_Character\n+--      representation generated by the package Ada.Wide_Text_IO.\n+--      Modify this program as needed to translate that file.\n+--\n+--      A wide character is represented by an 8 character sequence:\n+--\n+--          [\"abcd\"]\n+--\n+--      where the character code represented is specified by four hexadecimal\n+--      digits, abcd, with letters in upper case. For example the wide\n+--      character with the code 16#AB13# is represented by the eight\n+--      character sequence:\n+--\n+--          [\"AB13\"]\n+--\n+-- ASSUMPTIONS:\n+--\n+--      The path for these files is specified in ImpDef.\n+--\n+-- SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:\n+--\n+--     Compile, bind and execute this program.

The intent of the latter being the ability to represent\n+  -- literals in the Latin-1 character set that have position numbers\n+  -- greater than ASCII.DEL.

In the example\n+  -- below, where there are two consecutive characters to translate, we see\n+  -- that Front will assume three different values processing the string,\n+  -- these are indicated by the digits '1', '2' & '3' in the comment\n+  -- attached to the declaration.
