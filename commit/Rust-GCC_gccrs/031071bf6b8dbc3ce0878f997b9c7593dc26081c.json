On most systems where many fixes\n+are required, this is accomplished by putting most of the functionality\n+into a binary executable.  On systems that had dedicated fixinc.* shell\n+scripts, those scripts are still used by default until they can be\n+converted.\n+\n+KNOWN PROBLEMS\n+\n+There may be some systems on which the fixinc binary program appears\n+to be functional, but fails to work.  Current thinking is that this\n+is due to some new process limitations (fork() calls) on those\n+systems.  If you are experiencing this problem, then copy the script\n+${src}/gcc/fixinc/inclhack.sh into ${builddir}/gcc/fixinc.sh and run\n+make again.\n+\n+Oh, yes, please also report the problem with a description of\n+the failure mode (symptoms) and the output from:\n+\n+        egcs/config.guess\n+\n+TO DO\n+\n+* fixincl needs to be converted to use gcc's system.h, libiberty, and\n+  other portability frameworks.\n+\n+* FIXME: XXX needs to have tests for file descriptors > 10 or 12 added\n+  to detect/solve XXX.\n+\n+* \n+\n+\n+\n+THEORY OF OPS\n+\n+inclhack.def contains a list of potential fixes to be applied to the\n+system headers.   This file is processed by autogen to make both a\n+shell script and a binary to apply those fixes to your headers.\n+If the binary cannot be built, the shell version will be used instead.\n+\n+If mkfixinc.sh determines that your system needs machine-specific\n+fixes that have not yet been applied to inclhack.def, it will install\n+and use the current fixinc.* for that system instead.\n+\n+"}]}
