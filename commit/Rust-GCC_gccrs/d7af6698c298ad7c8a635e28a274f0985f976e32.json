It is relatively expensive to fire off a process to fix a source\n     file, therefore write apply tests to avoid unnecessary fix\n     processes.  The preferred apply tests are \"select\", \"bypass\" and\n-    \"c_test\" because they are performed internally.  \"test\" sends\n-    a command to a server shell that actually fires off one or more\n-    processes to do the testing.  Avoid it, if you can, but it is\n-    still more efficient than a fix process.  Also available is\n-    \"mach\".  If the target machine matches any of the named\n-    globbing-style patterns, then the machine name test will pass.\n-    It is desired, however, to limit the use of this test.\n+    \"c_test\" because they are performed internally.  The available\n+    tests are:\n+\n+    * select - Run a regex on the contents of the file being considered.\n+               All such regex-es must match.\n+\n+    * bypass - Run a regex on the contents of the file being considered.\n+               No such regex may match.\n+\n+    * c_test - call a function in fixtests.c.  See that file.\n+\n+    The next two tests are relatively slow because they must be handled\n+    in a separate shell process.  Some platforms do not support server\n+    shells, so the whole process is even slower and more cumbersome there.\n+\n+    * mach   - Match the output of config.conf against a series of globbing\n+               patterns.  It must match at least one of the patterns, unless\n+               \"not-machine\" has also been specified.  If that has been\n+               specified, then the config.conf output may not match any of\n+               the patterns.\n+\n+    * test   - These should be arguments to the program, \"/bin/test\".\n+               You may perform multiple commands, if you enclose them\n+               in backquotes and echo out valid test arguments.  For\n+               example, you might echo out '0 -eq 1' if you want a false\n+               result, or '0 -eq 0' for a true result.\n \n     These tests are required to:\n "}]}
