This was a\n+      deliberate tradeoff.  The only way to get a constant-time size() for\n+      linked lists would be to maintain an extra member variable containing\n+      the list's size.  This would require taking extra time to update that\n+      variable (it would make splice() a linear time operation, for example),\n+      and it would also make the list larger.  Many list algorithms don't\n+      require that extra word (algorithms that do require it might do better\n+      with vectors than with lists), and, when it is necessary to maintain\n+      an explicit size count, it's something that users can do themselves.\n+      </p>\n+      <p>This choice is permitted by the C++ standard. The standard says that\n+      size() &quot;should&quot; be constant time, and &quot;should&quot;\n+      does not mean the same thing as &quot;shall&quot;.
