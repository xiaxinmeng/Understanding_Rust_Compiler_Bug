SCO has made irresponsible public\n+statements about this supposed copyright infringement without\n+releasing any evidence of the infringement, and has demanded that\n+users of Linux, the kernel most often used with the GNU system, pay\n+for a license.  This license is incompatible with the GPL, and in the\n+opinion of the Free Software Foundation such a demand unquestionably\n+violates the GNU General Public License under which the kernel is\n+distributed.\n+\n+We have been urged to drop support for SCO Unix from this release of\n+GCC, as a protest against this irresponsible aggression against free\n+software and GNU/Linux.  However, the direct effect of this action\n+would fall on users of GCC rather than on SCO.  For the moment, we\n+have decided not to take that action.  The Free Software Foundation's\n+overriding goal is to protect the freedom of the free software\n+community, including developers and users, but we also want to serve\n+users.  Protecting the community from an attack sometimes requires\n+steps that will inconvenience some in the community.  Such a step is\n+not yet necessary, in our view, but we cannot indefinitely continue to\n+ignore the aggression against our community taken by a party that has\n+long profited from the commercial distribution of our programs.  We\n+urge users of SCO Unix to make clear to SCO their disapproval of the\n+company's aggression against the free software community.  We will\n+have a further announcement concerning continuing support of SCO Unix\n+by GCC before our next release."}]}
