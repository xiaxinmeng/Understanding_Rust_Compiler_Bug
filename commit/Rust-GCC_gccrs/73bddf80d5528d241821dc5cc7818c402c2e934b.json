The runtime has\n+been completely rewritten in gcc 2.4.  The earlier runtime had several\n+severe bugs and was rather incomplete.  The compiler has had several\n+new features added as well.\n+\n+This is not documentation for Objective C, it is usable to someone\n+who knows Objective C from somewhere else.\n+\n+\n+Runtime API functions\n+=====================\n+\n+The runtime is modeled after the NeXT Objective C runtime.  That is,\n+most functions have semantics as it is known from the NeXT.  The\n+names, however, have changed.  All runtime API functions have names\n+of lowercase letters and and underscores as opposed to the\n+`traditional' mixed case names.  \n+\tThe runtime api functions are not documented as of now.\n+Someone offered to write it, and did it, but we were not allowed to\n+use it by his university (Very sad story).  We have started writing\n+the documentation over again.  This will be announced in appropriate\n+places when it becomes available.\n+\n+\n+Protocols\n+=========\n+\n+Protocols are now fully supported.  The semantics is exactly as on the\n+NeXT.  There is a flag to specify how protocols should be typechecked\n+when adopted to classes.  The normal typechecker requires that all\n+methods in a given protocol must be implemented in the class that\n+adopts it -- it is not enough to inherit them.  The flag\n+`-Wno-protocol' causes it to allow inherited methods, while\n+`-Wprotocols' is the default which requires them defined.\n+\n+\n++initialize \n+===========\n+\n+This method, if defined, is called before any other instance or class\n+methods of that particular class.  This method is not inherited, and\n+is thus not called as initializer for a subclass that doesn't define\n+it itself.  Thus, each +initialize method is called exactly once (or\n+never if no methods of that particular class is never called).\n+Besides this, it is allowed to have several +initialize methods, one\n+for each category.  The order in which these (multiple methods) are\n+called is not well defined.  I am not completely certain what the\n+semantics of this method is for other implementations, but this is\n+how it works for GNU Objective C.\n+\n+\n+Passivation/Activation/Typedstreams\n+===================================\n+\n+This is supported in the style of NeXT TypedStream's.  Consult the\n+headerfile Typedstreams.h for api functions.  I (Kresten) have\n+rewritten it in Objective C, but this implementation is not part of\n+2.4, it is available from the GNU Objective C prerelease archive. \n+   There is one difference worth noting concerning objects stored with\n+objc_write_object_reference (aka NXWriteObjectReference).  When these\n+are read back in, their object is not guaranteed to be available until\n+the `-awake' method is called in the object that requests that object.\n+To objc_read_object you must pass a pointer to an id, which is valid\n+after exit from the function calling it (like e.g. an instance\n+variable).  In general, you should not use objects read in until the\n+-awake method is called.\n+\n+\n+Acknowledgements\n+================\n+\n+The GNU Objective C team: Geoffrey Knauth <gsk@marble.com> (manager),\n+Tom Wood <wood@next.com> (compiler) and Kresten Krab Thorup\n+<krab@iesd.auc.dk> (runtime) would like to thank a some people for\n+participating in the development of the present GNU Objective C.\n+\n+Paul Burchard <burchard@geom.umn.edu> and Andrew McCallum\n+<mccallum@cs.rochester.edu> has been very helpful debugging the\n+runtime.   Eric Herring <herring@iesd.auc.dk> has been very helpful\n+cleaning up after the documentation-copyright disaster and is now\n+helping with the new documentation.\n+\n+Steve Naroff <snaroff@next.com> and Richard Stallman\n+<rms@gnu.ai.mit.edu> has been very helpful with implementation details\n+in the compiler.\n+\n+\n+Bug Reports\n+===========\n+\n+Please read the section `Submitting Bugreports' of the gcc manual\n+before you submit any bugs."}]}
