My understanding is that gcn included omp_get_num_teams\nand omp_get_team_num definitions in both icv-device.o and teams.o,\nwith the definitions only in the former working correctly.\n\nThis patch brings gcn into sync with how nvptx does it, that teams.c\nis overridden, provides a dummy GOMP_teams_reg and omp_get_{num_teams,team_num}\ndefinitions and icv-device.c doesn't provide those.\n\n2021-11-12  Jakub Jelinek  <jakub@redhat.com>\n\n\tPR target/103201\n\t* config/gcn/icv-device.c (omp_get_num_teams, omp_get_team_num): Move\n\tto ...\n\t* config/gcn/teams.c: ... here.
