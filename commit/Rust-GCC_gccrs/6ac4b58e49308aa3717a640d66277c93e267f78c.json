Frontends which want that behavior should set\n   DECL_DEFER_OUTPUT before calling rest_of_decl_compilation.\n \n-Aug 31, 1998:\n-  The interface to HANDLE_PRAGMA has changed.  It now takes three arguments.\n-  The first two are pointers to functions that should be used to read characters\n-  from the input stream, and to push them back into the input stream respectively.\n-  The third argument is a pointer to a null terminate string which is the first\n-  word after #pragma.  The expression supplied by HANDLE_PRAGMA should return\n-  nonzero if it parsed and implemented the pragma.  Otherwise it should return\n-  zero, and leave the input stream as it was before the expression was evaluated.\n-\n-  A new back-end definable macro has been added: INSERT_ATTRIBUTES.  This macro\n-  allows backend to add attributes to decls as they are created.\n-\n-Jun 10, 1998:\n-  The interface to lang_decode_option has changed. It now uses and argc/argv\n-  interface to allow for options that use more than one input string. The new\n-  declaration is: int lang_decode_option (int argc, char** argv).

Look for references to\n-  [unsigned]int_DI_type_node in your front end.  If you have references\n-  to these variables, you'll need up update the front end.\n-\n-  To update the front end you must mirror all the code which currently\n-  deals with intDI_type_node to also handle intTI_type_node.\n-\n-\n-Apr 7, 1998:\n-  The interface between toplev.c and the language front ends for opening the\n-  source file has changed:\n-\n-  o init_lex() has been renamed to init_parse (char *filename) where filename\n-    is the name of the source file.\n-  o The code in toplev.c which opened the source file should be moved to\n-    the new init_parse function.\n-  o toplev.c now calls finish_parse() instead of closing the source file\n-    using fclose().
