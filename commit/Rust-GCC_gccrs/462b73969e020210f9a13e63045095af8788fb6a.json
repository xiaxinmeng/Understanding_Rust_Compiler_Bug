The following rules have always been\n+      true for both languages:\n+      <OL>\n+       <LI>You can point anywhere in the array, <EM>or to the first element\n+           past the end of the array</EM>.  A pointer that points to one\n+           past the end of the array is guaranteed to be as unique as a\n+           pointer to somewhere inside the array, so that you can compare\n+           such pointers safely.\n+       <LI>You can only dereference a pointer that points into an array.\n+           If your array pointer points outside the array -- even to just\n+           one past the end -- and you dereference it, Bad Things happen.\n+       <LI>Strictly speaking, simply pointing anywhere else invokes\n+           undefined behavior.  Most programs won't puke until such a\n+           pointer is actually dereferenced, but the standards leave that\n+           up to the platform.\n+      </OL>\n+      The reason this past-the-end addressing was allowed is to make it\n+      easy to write a loop to go over an entire array, e.g.,\n+      while (*d++ = *s++);.\n+   </P>\n+   <P>So, when you think of two pointers delimiting an array, don't think\n+      of them as indexing 0 through n-1.

Everything between the boundary markers is part of the array.\n+      Simple.\n+   </P>\n+   <P>Now think back to your junior-high school algebra course, when you\n+      were learning how to draw graphs.  Remember that a graph terminating\n+      with a solid dot meant, &quot;Everything up through this point,&quot;\n+      and a graph terminating with an open dot meant, &quot;Everything up\n+      to, but not including, this point,&quot; respectively called closed\n+      and open ranges?  Remember how closed ranges were written with\n+      brackets, <EM>[a,b]</EM>, and open ranges were written with parentheses,\n+      <EM>(a,b)</EM>?\n+   </P>\n+   <P>The boundary markers for arrays describe a <EM>half-open range</EM>,\n+      starting with (and including) the first element, and ending with (but\n+      not including) the last element:  <EM>[beginning,end)</EM>.  See, I\n+      told you it would be simple in the end.\n+   </P>\n+   <P>Iterators, and everything working with iterators, follows this same\n+      time-honored tradition.  A container's <TT>begin()</TT> method returns\n+      an iterator referring to the first element, and its <TT>end()</TT>\n+      method returns a past-the-end iterator, which is guaranteed to be\n+      unique and comparable against any other iterator pointing into the\n+      middle of the container.\n+   </P>\n+   <P>Container constructors, container methods, and algorithms, all take\n+      pairs of iterators describing a range of values on which to operate.\n+      All of these ranges are half-open ranges, so you pass the beginning\n+      iterator as the starting parameter, and the one-past-the-end iterator\n+      as the finishing parameter.\n+   </P>\n+   <P>This generalizes very well.  You can operate on sub-ranges quite\n+      easily this way; functions accepting a <EM>[first,last)</EM> range\n+      don't know or care whether they are the boundaries of an entire {array,\n+      sequence, container, whatever}, or whether they only enclose a few\n+      elements from the center.
