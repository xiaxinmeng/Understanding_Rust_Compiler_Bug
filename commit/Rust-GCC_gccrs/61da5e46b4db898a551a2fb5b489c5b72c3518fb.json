The other advantage of doing so, for the\nsecurity conscious is that this prevents intermingling of literal\npools with code.\n\nWilco's kindly done some performance measurements and suggests that\nthere is not really a performance regression in doing this.\nI've looked at the code size for SPEC2k6 today at -Ofast and\nin general there is a good code size improvement as expected\nby sharing said constants.\n\nTested on aarch64-none-elf with no regressions and bootstrapped\nand regression tested in my tree for a number of days now.\n\n2015-11-05  Ramana Radhakrishnan  <ramana.radhakrishnan@arm.com>\n\n        * config/aarch64/aarch64.c\n        (aarch64_can_use_per_function_literal_pools_p): New.\n        (aarch64_use_blocks_for_constant_p): Adjust declaration\n        and use aarch64_can_use_function_literal_pools_p.\n        (aarch64_select_rtx_section): Update.\n\nFrom-SVN: r229795", "tree": {"sha": "02bd824150436c418510c37825e7226ba1ba13a8", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/git/trees/02bd824150436c418510c37825e7226ba1ba13a8"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/git/commits/61da5e46b4db898a551a2fb5b489c5b72c3518fb", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/61da5e46b4db898a551a2fb5b489c5b72c3518fb", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commit/61da5e46b4db898a551a2fb5b489c5b72c3518fb", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/61da5e46b4db898a551a2fb5b489c5b72c3518fb/comments", "author": null, "committer": null, "parents": [{"sha": "e219e495bc5f009f59c5bdabf8905f7630d10fc6", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/e219e495bc5f009f59c5bdabf8905f7630d10fc6", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commit/e219e495bc5f009f59c5bdabf8905f7630d10fc6"}], "stats": {"total": 8, "additions": 8, "deletions": 0}, "files": [{"sha": "60ad78a2170d229dd01d1ecf6ba68c442e1f11ae", "filename": "gcc/ChangeLog", "status": "modified", "additions": 8, "deletions": 0, "changes": 8, "blob_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/61da5e46b4db898a551a2fb5b489c5b72c3518fb/gcc%2FChangeLog", "raw_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/raw/61da5e46b4db898a551a2fb5b489c5b72c3518fb/gcc%2FChangeLog", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/contents/gcc%2FChangeLog?ref=61da5e46b4db898a551a2fb5b489c5b72c3518fb", "patch": "@@ -1,3 +1,11 @@\n+2015-11-05  Ramana Radhakrishnan  <ramana.radhakrishnan@arm.com>\n+\n+        * config/aarch64/aarch64.c\n+        (aarch64_can_use_per_function_literal_pools_p): New.\n+        (aarch64_use_blocks_for_constant_p): Adjust declaration\n+        and use aarch64_can_use_function_literal_pools_p.\n+        (aarch64_select_rtx_section): Update.\n+\n 2015-11-05  Ilya Enkovich  <enkovich.gnu@gmail.com>\n \n \t* targhooks.c (default_get_mask_mode): Use BLKmode in"}]}
