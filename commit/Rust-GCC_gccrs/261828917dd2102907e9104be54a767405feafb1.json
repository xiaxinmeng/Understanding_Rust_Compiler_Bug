An [110]overview of the\n+   implementation status is available.\n+\n+   Briefly, the features of TR1 and the current status are:\n+\n+   Unordered containers - Complete - The unordered_set, unordered_map,\n+   unordered_multiset, and unordered_multimap containers are hashed\n+   versions of the map, set, multimap, and multiset containers\n+   respectively. These classes are suitable replacements for the SGI STL\n+   hash_map and hash_set extensions.\n+\n+   Reference-counted smart pointers - Complete - The shared_ptr and\n+   weak_ptr allow several object to know about a pointer and whether it\n+   is valid. When the last reference to the pointer is destroyed the\n+   pointer is freed.\n+\n+   Type traits - Complete - The type_traits class gives templates the\n+   ability to probe information about the input type and enable\n+   type-dependent logic to be performed without the need of template\n+   specializations.\n+\n+   Fixed-size arrays - Complete - The array class implements small\n+   fixed-sized arrays with container semantics.\n+\n+   Tuples - Complete - The tuple class implements small heterogeneous\n+   arrays. This is an enhanced pair. In fact, the standard pair is\n+   enhanced with a tuple interface.\n+\n+   A regular expression engine This library provides for regular\n+   expression objects with traversal of text with return of\n+   subexpressions.\n+\n+   A random number engine This library contains randow number generators\n+   with several different choices of distribution.\n+\n+   Special functions - Under construction - Twenty-three mathematical\n+   functions familiar to physicists and engineers are included:\n+   cylindrical and spherical Bessel and Neumann functions, hypergeometric\n+   functions, Laguerre polynomials, Legendre functions, elliptic\n+   integrals, exponential integrals and the Riemann zeta function all for\n+   your computing pleasure.\n+\n+   C99 compatibility - Under construction - There are many features\n+   designed to minimize the divergence of the C and the C++ languages.\n      _________________________________________________________________\n \n 5.6 Is libstdc++-v3 thread-safe?\n@@ -847,8 +903,8 @@ a\n    safe, do not assume that two threads may access a shared standard\n    library object at the same time.\n \n-   See chapters [105]17 (library introduction), [106]23 (containers), and\n-   [107]27 (I/O) for more information.\n+   See chapters [111]17 (library introduction), [112]23 (containers), and\n+   [113]27 (I/O) for more information.\n      _________________________________________________________________\n \n 5.7 How do I get a copy of the ISO C++ Standard?\n@@ -859,11 +915,11 @@ a\n    their two-meeting commitment for voting rights, may get a copy of the\n    standard from their respective national standards organization.
