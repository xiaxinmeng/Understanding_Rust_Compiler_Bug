In contrast\n+with many other garbage collectors, it is not implicitly invoked by\n+allocation routines when a lot of memory has been consumed. So the\n+only way to have GGC reclaim storage it to call the @code{ggc_collect}\n+function explicitly. This call is an expensive operation, as it may\n+have to scan the entire heap. Beware that local variables (on the GCC\n+call stack) are not followed by such an invocation (as many other\n+garbage collectors do): you should reference all your data from static\n+or external @code{GTY}-ed variables, and it is advised to call\n+@code{ggc_collect} with a shallow call stack. The GGC is an exact mark\n+and sweep garbage collector (so it does not scan the call stack for\n+pointers). In practice GCC passes don't often call @code{ggc_collect}\n+themselves, because it is called by the pass manager between passes."}]}
