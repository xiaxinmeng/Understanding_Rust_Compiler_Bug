A fix\n-for APAR IX75823 (OVERFLOW DURING LINK WHEN USING GCC AND -BBIGTOC) is\n-available from IBM Customer Support and from its website as PTF U455193.\n-\n-Due to changes in the way that GCC invokes the binder (linker) for AIX 4.1,\n-the link step now may produce warnings of duplicate symbols which were not\n-reported before.  The assembly files generated by GCC for AIX always have\n-included multiple symbol definitions for certain global variable and\n-function declarations in the original program.  The warnings should not\n-prevent the linker from producing a correct library or runnable executable.\n-\n-\n-\t\t\t     AIX NLS problems\n-\n-AIX on the RS/6000 provides support (NLS) for environments outside of\n-the United States.  Compilers and assemblers use NLS to support\n-locale-specific representations of various objects including\n-floating-point numbers (\".\" vs \",\" for separating decimal fractions).\n-There have been problems reported where the library linked with GCC does\n-not produce the same floating-point formats that the assembler accepts.\n-If you have this problem, set the LANG environment variable to \"C\" or\n-\"En_US\".\n-\n-\t\t\t\t     \n-\t\t\t AIX 3.2.5 XLC-1.3 problems\n-\n-XLC version 1.3.0.0 distributed with AIX 3.2.5 will miscompile jump.c when\n-building the stage1 compiler during the bootstrap process.  This will cause\n-GCC to crash and the bootstrap to fail later while compiling libgcc2.c.  XLC\n-version 1.3.0.1 or later fixes this problem.  XLC-1.3.0.19 also cannot\n-bootstrap GCC so please avoid that release as well.  You can obtain\n-XLC-1.3.0.24 by requesting PTF 432238 from IBM, or just ask for the latest\n-release of XLC-1.3.\n-\n-There also have been reports of problems bootstrapping GCC with some older\n-releases of xlc-1.2.1, including xlc-1.2.1.8.  Newer releases of xlc-1.2.1\n-do not exhibit this problem: xlc-1.2.1.28 is known to bootstrap properly.\n-\n-\n-\t\t       AIX 3.2 common-mode support\n-\n-AIX common-mode providing transparent support of both the POWER and PowerPC\n-architectures is usable in AIX 3.2.3 and above but an export file and\n-support for hidden export via libc.a will not exist until AIX 4.1.  libgcc.a\n-also must be compiled in common-mode.  Note that executables generated for\n-the POWER (RIOS1 and RSC) architecture will run directly on systems using\n-the MPC601 chip.  Common-mode only improves the performance of a single\n-executable run on both POWER and PowerPC architecture platforms by not using\n-POWER- or PowerPC-specific instructions and eliminating the need to trap to\n-emulation (for POWER instructions run on PowerPC).\n-\n-To link a common-mode application prior to AIX 4.1 and run it on a system at\n-AIX level 3.2.3 or above, use the text between the \"<>\" as an export file\n-(e.g. milli.exp)\n-\n-<><><><><><><><><><><>\n-#!\n-__mulh          0x3100\n-__mull          0x3180\n-__divss         0x3200\n-__divus         0x3280\n-__quoss         0x3300\n-__quous         0x3380\n-<><><><><><><><><><><>\n-\n-and then link with -Wl,-bI:milli.exp.\n-\n-\n-\t\t     AIX 3.1 and 3.2 assembler problems\n-\n-Specifying the -g flag to GCC on the RS/6000 requires upgrading the\n-standard AIX assembler distributed with AIX 3.1 and versions of AIX\n-3.2 earlier than 3.2.4 with a replacement that is available from IBM.\n-Note that Makefile.in specifies the -g when compiling libgcc2.c.\n-\n-You can test for the presence of a fixed assembler by entering the following:\n-\t\t% as -u < /dev/null\n-If the command exits normally, the assembler fix already is installed.\n-If the assembler complains that \"-u\" is an unknown flag, you need to order\n-the fix.\n-\n-If you are running AIX 3.1 (lslpp -h bos.obj output reports\n-03.01.0005.XXXX where the 0005 can be any higher number and the XXXX\n-can be any value), call IBM Support at 800-237-5511 and ask for\n-shipment of AIX/6000 fix PTF U403044 for APAR IX22829 (.extern foo\n-conflicts with defining foo).\n-\n-If you are running AIX 3.2 but not 3.2.4 or later (lslpp -h bos.obj\n-output reports 03.02.0000.0000), a newer update to the assembler fix\n-is available.  Ask for shipment of AIX/6000 fix PTF U416277 for\n-IX32992 (.global prevents detection of duplicate symbol).\n-\n-If you are running AIX 3.2.4 or later, you already have the new\n-assembler.\n-\n-Any customer can order and get the replacement assembler, and install it on\n-one or more machines.  It is available on diskette from IBM Customer Support\n-and from its website.\n-\n-If you contact IBM Customer Support, they may also ask you for your customer\n-number.  If you do not know it, you will still be able to get the fix, but\n-you will have to be persistent.  IBM has corresponding support organizations\n-outside of North America.  Call your IBM branch office and ask them to put\n-you in touch with the department that handles fixes for AIX/6000.  If that\n-doesn't work, ask for the department that handles software defect support\n-for AIX/6000 and ask for the APAR fix.\n-\n-If you use the GNU assembler instead of the system supplied assembler, you need\n-an assembler modified after October 16th, 1995 in order to build the GNU C\n-compiler.  This is because the GNU C compiler wants to build a variant of its\n-library, libgcc.a with the -mcpu=common switch to support building programs\n-that can run on either the Power or PowerPC machines."}, {"sha": "0c27b7c21bd05413c9f6c5812cac30885121f2a3", "filename": "gcc/doc/install.texi", "status": "modified", "additions": 50, "deletions": 26, "changes": 76, "blob_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/df002c7d8fdf477dc49a6960394dd9eb6c9d8c9c/gcc%2Fdoc%2Finstall.texi", "raw_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/raw/df002c7d8fdf477dc49a6960394dd9eb6c9d8c9c/gcc%2Fdoc%2Finstall.texi", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/contents/gcc%2Fdoc%2Finstall.texi?ref=df002c7d8fdf477dc49a6960394dd9eb6c9d8c9c", "patch": "@@ -33,7 +33,7 @@\n @settitle Installing GCC: Binaries\n @end ifset\n \n-@comment $Id$\n+@comment $Id: install.texi,v 1.1 2001/05/11 22:10:54 gerald Exp $\n @c Copyright (C) 2001 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n @c *** Converted to texinfo by Dean Wakerley, dean@wakerley.com\n \n@@ -242,10 +242,10 @@ where @emph{srcdir} == @emph{objdir} should still work, but doesn't\n get extensive testing; building where @emph{objdir} is a subdirectory\n of @emph{srcdir} is unsupported.\n \n-Second, when configuring a native system, either ``@command{cc}'' or \n-``@command{gcc}'' must be in your path or you must set CC in your \n-environment before running configure.\n-Otherwise the configuration scripts may fail.\n+Second, when configuring a native system, either ``@command{cc}'' or\n+``@command{gcc}'' must be in your path or you must set @command{CC} in\n+your environment before running configure.
