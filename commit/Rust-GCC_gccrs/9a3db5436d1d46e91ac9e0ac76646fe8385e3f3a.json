Support from some systems\r\n-has been removed from GCC 3: fx80, ns32-ns-genix, pyramid, tahoe,\r\n-gmicro, spur; most of these targets had not been updated since GCC\r\n-version 1.</p>\r\n-\r\n-<p>Support for older systems as targets for cross-compilation is less\r\n-problematic than support for them as hosts for GCC; if an\r\n-enthusiast wishes to make such a target work again\r\n-(including resurrecting any of the targets that never worked with GCC\r\n-2, starting from the last CVS version before they were removed),\r\n-patches <a href=\"../contribute.html\">following the usual\r\n-requirements</a> would be likely to be accepted, since they should not\r\n-affect the support for more modern targets.</p>\r\n-\r\n-<p>Support for old systems as hosts for GCC can cause problems if the\r\n-workarounds for compiler, library and operating system bugs affect the\r\n-cleanliness or maintainability of the rest of GCC.  In some cases, to\r\n-bring GCC up on such a system, if still possible with current GCC, may\r\n-require first installing an old version of GCC which did work on that\r\n-system, and using it to compile a more recent GCC, to avoid bugs in\r\n-the vendor compiler.  Old releases of GCC 1 and GCC 2 are available in\r\n-the old-releases directory on the <a href=\"../mirrors.html\">GCC mirror\r\n-sites</a>.  Header bugs may generally be avoided using\r\n-<code>fixincludes</code>, but bugs or deficiencies in libraries and\r\n-the operating system may still cause problems.</p>\r\n-\r\n-<p>For some systems, old versions of GNU binutils may also be useful,\r\n-and are available from pub/binutils/old-releases on <a\r\n-href=\"http://sources.redhat.com/mirrors.html\">sources.redhat.com\r\n-mirror sites</a>.</p>\r\n-\r\n-<p>Some of the information on specific systems above relates to\r\n-such older systems, but much of the information\r\n-about GCC on such systems (which may no longer be applicable to\r\n-current GCC) is to be found in the GCC texinfo manual.</p>\r\n-\r\n-<hr>\r\n-his is fixed by revision 24 or later of patch 108652\n+For Solaris 8, this is fixed by revision 24 or later of patch 108652\n (for SPARCs) or 108653 (for Intels).\n \n "}]}
