GCC used to stand for the GNU C\n+   Compiler, but since the compiler supports several other languages\n+   aside from C, it now stands for the GNU Compiler Collection.\n+\n+   This is a minor release to address several bugs in the [1]GCC version\n+   2.95.2 release.\n+\n+     * Generic bugfixes and improvements\n+          + Fix numerous problems that caused incorrect optimization in\n+            the register reloading code.\n+          + Fix numerous problems that caused incorrect optimization in\n+            the loop optimizer.\n+          + Fix aborts in the functions build_insn_chain and scan_loops\n+            under some circumstances.\n+          + Fix an alias analysis bug.\n+          + Fix an infinite compilation bug in the combiner.\n+          + A few problems with complex number support have been fixed.\n+          + It is no longer possible for gcc to act as a fork bomb when\n+            installed incorrectly.\n+          + The -fpack-struct option should be recognized now.\n+          + Fixed a bug that caused incorrect code to be generated due to\n+            a lost stack adjustment.\n+     * Platform specific bugfixes and improvements\n+          + Support building ARM toolchains hosted on Windows.\n+          + Fix attribute calculations in ARM toolchains.\n+          + arm-linux support has been improved.\n+          + Fix a PIC failure on sparc targets.\n+          + On ix86 targets, the regparm attribute should now work\n+            reliably.\n+          + Several updates for the h8300 port.\n+\n+   The whole suite has been extensively [2]regression tested and\n+   [3]package tested. It should be reliable and suitable for widespread\n+   use.\n+\n+   The GCC 2.95 release has several new optimizations, new targets, new\n+   languages and other new features as compared to EGCS 1.1 or GCC 2.8.\n+   See the [4]new features page for a more complete list of new features\n+   found in the GCC 2.95 releases.\n+\n+   The sources include installation instructions in both HTML and\n+   plaintext forms in the install directory in the distribution. However,\n+   the most up to date [5]installation instructions and [6]build/test\n+   status are on the web pages. We will update those pages as new\n+   information becomes available.\n+\n+   The GCC developers would like to thank the numerous people that have\n+   contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc to GCC. This\n+   [7]amazing group of volunteers is what makes GCC successful.\n+\n+   And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some\n+   [8]caveats to using GCC 2.95.3.\n+\n+   Download GCC
