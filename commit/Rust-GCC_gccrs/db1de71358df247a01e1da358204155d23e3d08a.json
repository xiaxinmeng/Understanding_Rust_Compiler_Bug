SCO has made irresponsible public\n-statements about this supposed copyright infringement without\n-releasing any evidence of the infringement, and has demanded that\n-users of Linux, the kernel most often used with the GNU system, pay\n-for a license.  This license is incompatible with the GPL, and in the\n-opinion of the Free Software Foundation such a demand unquestionably\n-violates the GNU General Public License under which the kernel is\n-distributed.\n+The GCC team has been urged to drop support for SCO Unix from GCC, as\n+a protest against SCO's irresponsible aggression against free software\n+and GNU/Linux.  We have decided to take no action at this time, as we\n+no longer believe that SCO is a serious threat.\n \n-We have been urged to drop support for SCO Unix from this release of\n-GCC, as a protest against this irresponsible aggression against free\n-software and GNU/Linux.  However, the direct effect of this action\n-would fall on users of GCC rather than on SCO.  For the moment, we\n-have decided not to take that action.  The Free Software Foundation's\n-overriding goal is to protect the freedom of the free software\n-community, including developers and users, but we also want to serve\n-users.  Protecting the community from an attack sometimes requires\n-steps that will inconvenience some in the community.  Such a step is\n-not yet necessary, in our view, but we cannot indefinitely continue to\n-ignore the aggression against our community taken by a party that has\n-long profited from the commercial distribution of our programs.  We\n-urge users of SCO Unix to make clear to SCO their disapproval of the\n-company's aggression against the free software community.  We will\n-have a further announcement concerning continuing support of SCO Unix\n-by GCC before our next release.\n+For more on the FSF's position regarding SCO's attacks on free\n+software, please read:\n+\n+  http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/sco/sco.html"}]}
