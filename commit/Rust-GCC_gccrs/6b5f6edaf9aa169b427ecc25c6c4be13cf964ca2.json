FSF.\n-\n-Note that you'll need @code{tar} and other utilities\n-as well, but all UNIX systems have these.\n-There are GNU versions of all these available---in fact,\n-a complete GNU UNIX system can be put together on\n-most systems, if desired.\n-\n-The version of GNU @code{gzip} used to package this release\n-is @value{version-gzip}.\n-(The version of GNU @code{tar} used to package this release\n-is @value{version-tar}.)\n-\n-@item @file{gcc-@value{version-gcc}.tar.gz}\n-You need to have this, or some other applicable, version\n-of @code{gcc} on your system.\n-The version should be an exact copy of a distribution\n-from the FSF.\n-Its size is approximately 8.4MB.\n-\n-If you've already unpacked @file{gcc-@value{version-gcc}.tar.gz} into a\n-directory (named @file{gcc-@value{version-gcc}}) called the @dfn{source tree}\n-for @code{gcc}, you can delete the distribution\n-itself, but you'll need to remember to skip any instructions to unpack\n-this distribution.\n-\n-Without an applicable @code{gcc} source tree, you cannot\n-build @code{g77}.\n-You can obtain an FSF distribution of @code{gcc} from the FSF.\n-\n-@item @file{g77-@value{version-g77}.tar.gz}\n-You probably have already unpacked this package,\n-or you are reading an advance copy of these installation instructions,\n-which are contained in this

space\n-The amount of disk space needed to unpack, build, install,\n-and use @code{g77} depends on the type of system you're\n-using, how you build @code{g77}, and how much of it you\n-install (primarily, which languages you install).\n-\n-The sizes shown below assume all languages distributed in\n-@c As of `Version 2.249', texinfo.tex loses on a construction like\n-@c @code{...@value{...-...}...} since the hyphen is expanded as\n-@c -@discretionary{}{}{}, even though @value resets its catcode.\n-@c Fortunately this is currently the only instance.

sizes are indicative of GNU/Linux systems on\n-Intel x86 running COFF and on Digital Alpha (AXP) systems\n-running ELF.\n-These should be fairly representative of 32-bit and 64-bit\n-systems, respectively.\n-\n-Note that all sizes are approximate and subject to change without\n-notice!\n-They are based on preliminary releases of g77 made shortly\n-before the public beta release.\n-\n-@itemize ---\n-@item\n-@code{gcc} and @code{g77} distributions occupy 10MB\n-packed, 40MB unpacked.\n-These consist of the source code and documentation,\n-plus some derived files (mostly documentation), for\n-@code{gcc} and @code{g77}.\n-Any deviations from these numbers for different\n-kinds of systems are likely to be very minor.\n-\n-@item\n-A ``bootstrap'' build requires an additional 91MB\n-for a total of 132MB on an ix86, and an additional\n-136MB for a total of 177MB on an Alpha.\n-\n-@item\n-Removing @file{gcc/stage1} after the build recovers\n-13MB for a total of 119MB on an ix86, and recovers\n-21MB for a total of 155MB on an Alpha.\n-\n-After doing this, the integrity of the build can\n-still be verified via @samp{make compare}, and the\n-@code{gcc} compiler modified and used to build itself for\n-testing fairly quickly, using the copy of the compiler\n-kept in @code{gcc/stage2}.\n-\n-@item\n-Removing @file{gcc/stage2} after the build further\n-recovers 39MB for a total of 80MB, and recovers\n-57MB for a total of 98MB on an Alpha.\n-\n-After doing this, the compiler can still be installed,\n-especially if GNU @code{make} is used to avoid\n-gratuitous rebuilds (or, the installation can be done\n-by hand).\n-\n-@item\n-Installing @code{gcc} and @code{g77} copies\n-23MB onto the @samp{--prefix} disk for a total of 103MB\n-on an ix86, and copies 31MB onto the @samp{--prefix}\n-disk for a total of 130MB on an Alpha.\n-@end itemize\n-\n-After installation, if no further modifications and\n-builds of @code{gcc} or @code{g77} are planned, the\n-source and build directory may be removed, leaving\n-the total impact on a system's disk storage as\n-that of the amount copied during installation.\n-\n-Systems with the appropriate version of @code{gcc}\n-installed don't require the complete\n-bootstrap build.\n-Doing a ``straight build'' requires about as much\n-space as does a bootstrap build followed by removing\n-both the @file{gcc/stage1} and @file{gcc/stage2}\n-directories.\n-\n-Installing @code{gcc} and @code{g77} over existing\n-versions might require less @emph{new} disk space,\n-but note that, unlike many products, @code{gcc}\n-installs itself in a way that avoids overwriting other\n-installed versions of itself, so that other versions may\n-easily be invoked (via @samp{gcc -V @var{version}}).\n-\n-So, the amount of space saved as a result of having\n-an existing version of @code{gcc} and @code{g77}\n-already installed is not much---typically only the\n-command drivers (@code{gcc}, @code{g77}, @code{g++},\n-and so on, which are small) and the documentation\n-is overwritten by the new installation.\n-The rest of the new installation is done without\n-replacing existing installed versions (assuming\n-they have different version numbers).\n-\n-@item @code{make}\n-Your system must have @code{make}, and you will probably save\n-yourself a lot of trouble if it is GNU @code{make} (sometimes\n-referred to as @code{gmake}).\n-In particular, you probably need GNU @code{make}\n-to build outside the source directory\n-(with @code{configure}'s @samp{--srcdir} option.)\n-\n-The version of GNU @code{make} used to develop this release\n-is @value{version-make}.\n-\n-@item @code{cc}\n-Your system must have a working C compiler.\n-If it doesn't, you might be able to obtain\n-a prebuilt binary of some version of @code{gcc}\n-from the network or on CD-ROM,\n-perhaps from the FSF@.\n-The best source of information about binaries\n-is probably a system-specific Usenet news group,\n-initially via its FAQ.\n-\n-@xref{Installation,,Installing GNU CC,gcc,Using and Porting GNU CC},\n-for more information on prerequisites for installing @code{gcc}.\n-\n-@item @code{sed}\n-All UNIX systems have @code{sed}, but some have a broken\n-version that cannot handle configuring, building, or\n-installing @code{gcc} or @code{g77}.\n-\n-The version of GNU @code{sed} used to develop this release\n-is @value{version-sed}.\n-(Note that GNU @code{sed} version 3.0 was withdrawn by the\n-FSF---if you happen to have this version installed, replace\n-it with version @value{version-sed} immediately.\n-See a GNU distribution site for further explanation.)\n-\n-@item @code{root} access or equivalent\n-To perform the complete installation procedures on a system,\n-you need to have @code{root} access to that system, or\n-equivalent access to the @samp{--prefix} directory tree\n-specified on the @code{configure} command line.\n-\n-Portions of the procedure (such as configuring and building\n-@code{g77}) can be performed by any user with enough disk\n-space and virtual memory.\n-\n-However, these instructions are oriented towards less-experienced\n-users who want to install @code{g77} on their own personal\n-systems.\n-\n-System administrators with more experience will want to\n-determine for themselves how they want to modify the\n-procedures described below to suit the needs of their\n-installation.\n-\n-@item @code{autoconf}\n-The version of GNU @code{autoconf} used to develop this release\n-is @value{version-autoconf}.\n-\n-@code{autoconf} is not needed in the

are sure your system is missing\n-@code{bsearch} or @code{strtoul} in its library,\n-define the relevant macro(s) before building @code{g77}.\n-This can be done by editing @file{@value{path-g77}/proj.c} and inserting\n-either or both of the following @samp{#define} statements\n-before the comment shown:\n-\n-@smallexample\n-/* Insert #define statements here.  */\n-\n-#define NEED_BSEARCH\n-#define NEED_STRTOUL\n-@end smallexample\n-\n-Then, continue configuring and building @code{g77} as usual.\n-\n-Or, you can define these on the @code{make} command line.\n-To build with the bundled @code{cc} on SunOS4, for example, try:\n-@smallexample\n-make bootstrap BOOT_CFLAGS='-O2 -g -DNEED_STRTOUL'\n-@end smallexample\n-\n-If you then encounter problems compiling @file{@value{path-g77}/proj.c},\n-it might be due to a discrepancy between how @code{bsearch}\n-or @code{strtoul} are defined by that file and how they're\n-declared by your system's header files.\n-\n-In that case, you'll have to use some basic knowledge of C\n-to work around the problem, perhaps by editing @file{@value{path-g77}/proj.c}\n-somewhat.\n-\n-@end ifclear\n \n @node Cleanup

distributions, unpacking\n-@cindex code, source\n-@cindex source code\n-@cindex source tree\n-@cindex packages\n-\n-The @code{gcc} source distribution is a stand-alone distribution.\n-It is designed to be unpacked (producing the @code{gcc}\n-source tree) and built as is, assuming certain\n-prerequisites are met (including the availability of compatible\n-UNIX programs such as @code{make}, @code{cc}, and so on).\n-\n-However, before building @code{gcc}, you will want to unpack\n-and merge the @code{g77} distribution in with it, so that you\n-build a Fortran-capable version of @code{gcc}, which includes\n-the @code{g77} command, the necessary run-time libraries,\n-and this manual.\n-\n-Unlike @code{gcc}, the @code{g77} source distribution\n-is @emph{not} a stand-alone distribution.\n-It is designed to be unpacked and, afterwards, immediately merged\n-into an applicable @code{gcc} source tree.\n-That is, the @code{g77} distribution @emph{augments} a\n-@code{gcc} distribution---without @code{gcc}, generally\n-only the documentation is immediately usable.\n-\n-A sequence of commands typically used to unpack @code{gcc}\n-and @code{g77} is:\n-\n-@example\n-sh# @kbd{cd /usr/src}\n-sh# @kbd{gunzip -c /usr/FSF/gcc-@value{version-gcc}.tar.gz | tar xf -}\n-sh# @kbd{gunzip -c /usr/FSF/g77-@value{version-g77}.tar.gz | tar xf -}\n-sh# @kbd{ln -s

@samp{Broken pipe@dots{}} as they complete.\n-That is nothing to worry about, unless you actually\n-@emph{hear} a pipe breaking.\n-The @code{ln} commands are helpful in reducing typing\n-and clutter in installation examples in this manual.\n-Hereafter, the top level of @code{gcc} source tree is referred to\n-as @file{gcc}, and the top level of just the @code{g77}\n-source tree (prior to issuing the @code{mv} command, above)\n-is referred to as @file{g77}.\n-\n-There are three top-level names in a @code{g77} distribution:\n-\n-@example\n-g77/COPYING.g77\n-g77/README.g77\n-g77/f\n-@end example\n-\n-All three entries should be moved (or copied) into a @code{gcc}\n-source tree (typically named after its version number and\n-as it appears in the FSF distributions---e.g. @file{gcc-@value{version-gcc}}).\n-\n-@file{g77/f} is the subdirectory containing all of the\n-code, documentation, and other information that is specific\n-to @code{g77}.\n-The other two files exist to provide information on @code{g77}\n-to someone encountering a @code{gcc} source tree with @code{g77}\n-already present, who has not yet read these installation\n-instructions and thus needs help understanding that the\n-source tree they are looking at does not come from a single\n-FSF distribution.\n-They also help people encountering an unmerged @code{g77} source\n-tree for the first time.\n-\n-@cindex modifying @code{g77}\n-@cindex code, modifying\n-@cindex Pentium optimizations\n-@cindex optimization, for Pentium\n-@emph{Note:} Please use @strong{only} @code{gcc} and @code{g77}\n-source trees as distributed by the FSF.\n-Use of modified versions is likely to result in problems that appear to be\n-in the @code{g77} code but, in fact, are not.\n-Do not use such modified versions\n-unless you understand all the differences between them and the versions\n-the FSF distributes---in which case you should be able to modify the\n-@code{g77} (or @code{gcc}) source trees appropriately so @code{g77}\n-and @code{gcc} can coexist as they do in the stock FSF distributions.\n-\n-@node Merging Distributions\n-@subsection Merging Distributions\n-@cindex merging distributions\n-@cindex @code{gcc}, versions supported by @code{g77}\n-@cindex versions, of @code{gcc}\n-@cindex support, @code{gcc} versions\n-\n-After merging the @code{g77} source tree into the @code{gcc} source tree,\n-you have put together a complete @code{g77} source tree.\n-\n-@cindex @code{gcc}, version number\n-@cindex version number\n-@cindex @code{g77}, version number\n-@cindex GNU version numbering\n-As of version 0.5.23, @code{g77} no longer modifies\n-the version number of @code{gcc},\n-nor does it patch @code{gcc} itself.\n-\n-@code{g77} still depends on being merged with an\n-appropriate version of @code{gcc}.\n-For version @value{version-g77} of @code{g77},\n-the specific version of @code{gcc} supported is @value{version-gcc}.\n-\n-However, other versions of @code{gcc} might be suitable\n-``hosts'' for this version of @code{g77}.\n-\n-GNU version numbers make it easy to figure out whether a\n-particular version of a distribution is newer or older than\n-some other version of that distribution.\n-The format is,\n-generally, @var{major}.@var{minor}.@var{patch}, with\n-each field being a decimal number.\n-(You can safely ignore\n-leading zeros; for example, 1.5.3 is the same as 1.5.03.)\n-The @var{major} field only increases with time.\n-The other two fields are reset to 0 when the field to\n-their left is incremented; otherwise, they, too, only\n-increase with time.\n-So, version 2.6.2 is newer than version 2.5.8, and\n-version 3.0 is newer than both.\n-(Trailing @samp{.0} fields often are omitted in\n-announcements and in names for distributions and\n-the directories they create.)\n-\n-If your version of @code{gcc} is older than the oldest version\n-supported by @code{g77}\n-(as casually determined by listing the contents of @file{@value{path-g77}/INSTALL/},\n-which contains these installation instructions in plain-text format),\n-you should obtain a newer, supported version of @code{gcc}.\n-(You could instead obtain an older version of @code{g77},\n-or try and get your @code{g77} to work with the old\n-@code{gcc}, but neither approach is recommended, and\n-you shouldn't bother reporting any bugs you find if you\n-take either approach, because they're probably already\n-fixed in the newer versions you're not using.)\n-\n-If your version of @code{gcc} is newer than the newest version\n-supported by @code{g77}, it is possible that your @code{g77}\n-will work with it anyway.\n-If the version number for @code{gcc} differs only in the\n-@var{patch} field, you might as well try that version of @code{gcc}.\n-Since it has the same @var{major} and @var{minor} fields,\n-the resulting combination is likely to work.\n-\n-So, for example, if a particular version of @code{g77} has support for\n-@code{gcc} versions 2.8.0 and 2.8.1,\n-it is likely that @file{gcc-2.8.2} would work well with @code{g77}.\n-\n-However, @file{gcc-2.9.0} would almost certainly\n-not work with that version of @code{g77}\n-without appropriate modifications,\n-so a new version of @code{g77} would be needed.\n-\n-@cindex distributions, why separate\n-@cindex separate distributions\n-@cindex why separate distributions\n-This complexity is the result of @code{gcc} and @code{g77} being\n-separate distributions.\n-By keeping them separate, each product is able to be independently\n-improved and distributed to its user base more frequently.\n-\n-However, the GBE interface defined by @code{gcc} typically\n-undergoes some incompatible changes at least every time the\n-@var{minor} field of the version number is incremented,\n-and such changes require corresponding changes to\n-the @code{g77} front end (FFE).\n-\n-@c @pindex config-lang.in\n-@c @emph{Note:} @code{g77}'s configuration file @file{@value{path-g77}/config-lang.in}\n-@c sometimes ensures that the source code for the version of @code{gcc}\n-@c being configured has at least one indication of being an appropriate\n-@c version as required specifically by @code{g77}.\n-@c This configuration-time\n-@c checking should catch failures to use the proper version of @code{gcc} and,\n-@c if so caught, should abort the configuration with an explanation.\n-@c @emph{Please} do not try to disable this check,\n-@c otherwise @code{g77} might well appear to build\n-@c and install correctly, and even appear to compile correctly,\n-@c but could easily produce broken code.\n-\n-@node Where to Install\n-@subsection Where in the World Does Fortran (and GNU CC) Go?\n-@cindex language f77 not recognized\n-@cindex @code{gcc}, will not compile Fortran programs\n-\n-Before configuring, you should make sure you know\n-where you want the @code{g77} and @code{gcc}\n-binaries to be installed after they're built,\n-because this information is given to the configuration\n-tool and used during the build itself.\n-\n-A @code{g77} installation normally includes installation of\n-a Fortran-aware version of @code{gcc}, so that the @code{gcc}\n-command recognizes Fortran source files and knows how to compile\n-them.\n-\n-For this to work, the version of @code{gcc} that you will be building\n-as part of @code{g77} @strong{must} be installed as the ``active''\n-version of @code{gcc} on the system.\n-\n-Sometimes people make the mistake of installing @code{gcc} as\n-@file{/usr/local/bin/gcc},\n-leaving an older, non-Fortran-aware version in @file{/usr/bin/gcc}.\n-(Or, the opposite happens.)\n-This can result in @code{gcc} being unable to compile Fortran\n-source files,\n-because when the older version of @code{gcc} is invoked,\n-it complains that it does not\n-recognize the language, or the file name suffix.\n-\n-So, determine whether @code{gcc} already is installed on your system,\n-and, if so, @emph{where} it is installed, and prepare to configure the\n-new version of @code{gcc} you'll be building so that it installs\n-over the existing version of @code{gcc}.\n-\n-You might want to back up your existing copy of @file{/usr/bin/gcc}, and\n-the entire @file{/usr/lib} directory, before\n-you perform the actual installation (as described in this manual).\n-\n-Existing @code{gcc} installations typically are\n-found in @file{/usr} or @file{/usr/local}.\n-(This means the commands are installed in @file{/usr/bin} or\n-@file{/usr/local/bin},\n-the libraries in @file{/usr/lib} or @file{/usr/local/lib},\n-and so on.)\n-\n-If you aren't certain where the currently\n-installed version of @code{gcc} and its\n-related programs reside, look at the output\n-of this command:\n-\n-@example\n-gcc -v -o /tmp/delete-me -xc /dev/null -xnone\n-@end example\n-\n-All sorts of interesting information on the locations of various\n-@code{gcc}-related programs and data files should be visible\n-in the output of the above command.\n-(The output also is likely to include a diagnostic from\n-the linker, since there's no @samp{main_()} function.)\n-However, you do have to sift through it yourself; @code{gcc}\n-currently provides no easy way to ask it where it is installed\n-and where it looks for the various programs and data files it\n-calls on to do its work.\n-\n-Just @emph{building} @code{g77} should not overwrite any installed\n-programs---but, usually, after you build @code{g77}, you will want\n-to install it, so backing up anything it might overwrite is\n-a good idea.\n-(This is true for any package, not just @code{g77},\n-though in this case it is intentional that @code{g77} overwrites\n-@code{gcc} if it is already installed---it is unusual that\n-the installation process for one distribution intentionally\n-overwrites a program or file installed by another distribution,\n-although, in this case, @code{g77} is an augmentation of the\n-@code{gcc} distribution.)\n-\n-Another reason to back up the existing version first,\n-or make sure you can restore it easily, is that it might be\n-an older version on which other users have come to depend\n-for certain behaviors.\n-However, even the new version of @code{gcc} you install\n-will offer users the ability to specify an older version of\n-the actual compilation programs if desired, and these\n-older versions need not include any @code{g77} components.\n-@xref{Target Options,,Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version,\n-gcc,Using and Porting GNU CC}, for information

@code{autoconf} configuration\n-system.\n-\n-Generally, you shouldn't have to be concerned with\n-either @code{g77} or @code{libg2c} configuration, unless\n-you're configuring @code{g77} as a cross-compiler.\n-In this case, the @code{libg2c} configuration, and possibly the\n-@code{g77} and @code{gcc} configurations as well,\n-might need special attention.\n-(This also might be the case if you're porting @code{gcc} to\n-a whole new system---even if it is just a new operating system\n-on an existing, supported CPU.)\n-\n-To configure the system, see\n-@ref{Installation,,Installing GNU CC,gcc,Using and Porting GNU CC},\n-following the instructions for running @file{./configure}.\n-Pay special attention to the @samp{--prefix=} option, which\n-you almost certainly will need to specify.\n-\n-(Note that @code{gcc} installation information is provided\n-as a plain-text file in @file{gcc/INSTALL}.)\n-\n-The information printed by the invocation of @file{./configure}\n-should show that the @file{f} directory (the Fortran language)\n-has been configured.\n-If it does not, there is a problem.\n-\n-@emph{Note:} Configuring with the @samp{--srcdir} argument,\n-or by starting in an empty directory\n-and typing a command such as @kbd{../gcc/configure} to\n-build with separate build and source directories,\n-is known to work with GNU @code{make},\n-but it is known to not work with other variants of @code{make}.\n-Irix5.2 and SunOS4.1 versions of @code{make} definitely\n-won't work outside the source directory at present.\n-\n-@code{g77}'s portion of the @file{configure} script\n-used to issue a warning message about this\n-when configuring for building binaries outside the source directory,\n-but no longer does this as of version 0.5.23.\n-\n-Instead, @code{g77} simply rejects most common attempts\n-to build it using a non-GNU @code{make} when the\n-build directory is not the same as the source directory,\n-issuing an explanatory diagnostic.\n-\n-@node Building gcc\n-@subsection Building GNU CC\n-@cindex building @code{gcc}\n-@cindex building @code{g77}\n-\n-@cindex @code{LANGUAGES} macro\n-Building @code{g77} requires building enough of @code{gcc} that\n-these instructions assume you're going to build all of\n-@code{gcc}, including @code{g++}, @code{protoize}, and so on.\n-You can save a little time and disk space by changes the\n-@code{LANGUAGES} macro definition in @code{gcc/Makefile.in}\n-or @code{gcc/Makefile}, but if you do that, you're on your own.\n-One change is almost @emph{certainly} going to cause failures:\n-removing @code{c} or @code{f77} from the definition of the\n-@code{LANGUAGES} macro.\n-\n-After configuring @code{gcc}, which configures @code{g77} and\n-@code{libg2c} automatically, you're ready to start the actual\n-build by invoking @code{make}.\n-\n-@pindex configure\n-@emph{Note:} You @strong{must} have run the @file{configure}\n-script in @code{gcc} before you run @code{make},\n-even if you're using an already existing @code{gcc} development directory,\n-because @file{./configure} does the work to recognize that you've added\n-@code{g77} to the configuration.\n-\n-There are two general approaches to building GNU CC from\n-scratch:\n-\n-@table @dfn\n-@item bootstrap\n-This method uses minimal native system facilities to\n-build a barebones, unoptimized @code{gcc}, that is then\n-used to compile (``bootstrap'') the entire system.\n-\n-@item straight\n-This method assumes a more complete native system\n-exists, and uses that just once to build the entire\n-system.\n-@end table\n-\n-On all systems without a recent version of @code{gcc}\n-already installed, the @i{bootstrap} method must be\n-used.\n-In particular, @code{g77} uses extensions to the C\n-language offered, apparently, only by @code{gcc}.\n-\n-On most systems with a recent version of @code{gcc}\n-already installed, the @i{straight} method can be\n-used.\n-This is an advantage, because it takes less CPU time\n-and disk space for the build.\n-However, it does require that the system have fairly\n-recent versions of many GNU programs and other\n-programs, which are not enumerated here.\n-\n-@menu\n-* Bootstrap Build::  For all systems.\n-* Straight Build::   For systems with a recent version of @code{gcc}.\n-@end menu\n-\n-@node Bootstrap Build\n-@subsubsection Bootstrap Build\n-@cindex bootstrap build\n-@cindex build, bootstrap\n-\n-A complete bootstrap build is done by issuing a command\n-beginning with @samp{make bootstrap @dots{}}, as\n-described in @ref{Installation,,Installing GNU CC,\n-gcc,Using and Porting GNU CC}.\n-This is the most reliable form of build, but it does require\n-the most disk space and CPU time, since the complete system\n-is built twice (in Stages 2 and 3), after an initial build\n-(during Stage 1) of a minimal @code{gcc} compiler using\n-the native compiler and libraries.\n-\n-You might have to, or want to, control the way a bootstrap\n-build is done by entering the @code{make} commands to build\n-each stage one at a time, as described in the @code{gcc}\n-manual.\n-For example, to save time or disk space, you might want\n-to not bother doing the Stage 3 build, in which case you\n-are assuming that the @code{gcc} compiler you have built\n-is basically sound (because you are giving up the opportunity\n-to compare a large number of object files to ensure they're\n-identical).\n-\n-To save some disk space during installation, after Stage 2\n-is built, you can type @samp{rm -fr stage1} to remove the\n-binaries built during Stage 1.\n-\n-Also, see @ref{Installation,,Installing GNU CC,gcc,Using and Porting GNU CC},\n-for important information on building @code{gcc} that is\n-not described in this @code{g77} manual.\n-For example, explanations of diagnostic messages\n-and whether they're expected, or indicate trouble,\n-are found there.\n-\n-@node Straight

certain it produces code that is\n-object-compatible with the version of @code{gcc}\n-you want to build as part of building @code{g77},\n-you can save time and disk space by doing a straight\n-build.\n-\n-To build just the compilers along with the\n-necessary run-time libraries, issue the following\n-command:\n-\n-@example\n-make -k CC=gcc\n-@end example\n-\n-If you run into problems using this method, you have\n-two options:\n-\n-@itemize @bullet\n-@item\n-Abandon this approach and do a bootstrap build.\n-\n-@item\n-Try to make this approach work by diagnosing

a patch that changes the source code or documentation\n-(including, sometimes, the official patches distributed by\n-the FSF).\n-\n-@item\n-Deleting the files that are created by the (missing) tools.\n-\n-The @samp{make maintainer-clean} command is supposed\n-to delete these files, so invoking this command without\n-having all the appropriate tools installed is not recommended.\n-\n-@item\n-Creating the source directory using a method that\n-does not preserve the date-time-modified information\n-in the original distribution.\n-\n-For example, the UNIX @samp{cp -r} command copies a\n-directory tree without preserving the date-time-modified\n-information.\n-Use @samp{cp -pr} instead.\n-@end itemize\n-\n-The reason these activities cause @code{make} to try and\n-invoke tools that it probably wouldn't when building\n-from a perfectly ``clean'' source directory containing\n-@code{gcc} and @code{g77} is that some files in the\n-source directory (and the corresponding distribution)\n-aren't really source files, but @emph{derived} files\n-that are produced by running tools with the corresponding\n-source files as input.\n-These derived files @dfn{depend}, in @code{make} terminology,\n-on the corresponding source files.\n-\n-@code{make} determines that a file that depends on another\n-needs to be updated if the date-time-modified information for\n-the source file shows that it is newer than the corresponding\n-information for the derived file.\n-\n-If it makes that determination, @code{make} runs the appropriate\n-commands (specified in the ``Makefile'') to update the\n-derived file, and this process typically calls upon one or\n-more installed tools to do the work.\n-\n-The ``safest'' approach to dealing with this situation\n-is to recreate the @code{gcc} and @code{g77} source\n-directories from complete @code{gcc} and @code{g77} distributions\n-known to be provided by the FSF.\n-\n-Another fairly ``safe'' approach is to simply install\n-the tools you need to complete the build process.\n-This is especially appropriate if you've changed the\n-source code or applied a patch to do so.\n-\n-However, if you're certain that the problem is limited\n-entirely to incorrect date-time-modified information,\n-that there are no discrepancies between the contents of\n-source files and files derived from them in the source\n-directory, you can often update the date-time-modified\n-information for the derived files to work around the\n-problem of not having the appropriate tools installed.\n-\n-On UNIX systems, the simplest way to update the date-time-modified\n-information of a file is to use the use the @code{touch}\n-command.\n-\n-How to use @code{touch} to update the derived files\n-updated by each of the tools is described below.\n-@emph{Note:} New versions of @code{g77} might change the set of\n-files it generates by invoking each of these tools.\n-If you cannot figure\n-out for yourself how to handle such a situation, try an\n-older version of @code{g77} until you find someone who can\n-(or until you obtain and install the relevant tools).\n-\n-@menu\n-* autoconf: Missing

documentation (by editing @file{@value{path-g77}/*.texi}\n-and doing @samp{make doc} from the @file{/usr/src/gcc} directory)\n-to reflect any changes you've made to @code{g77}, or at\n-least to encourage users of your binary distribution to\n-report bugs to you first.\n-\n-Also, whether you distribute binaries or install @code{g77}\n-on your own system, it might be helpful for everyone to\n-add a line listing this manual by name and topic to the\n-top-level @code{info} node in @file{/usr/info/dir}.\n-That way, users can find @code{g77} documentation more\n-easily.\n-@xref{Updating Documentation,,Updating Your Info Directory}.\n-\n-@item man/man1/g77.1\n-This is the short man page for @code{g77}.\n-It is not always kept up-to-date,\n-but you might as well include it\n-for people who really like ``man'' pages.\n-\n-@cindex gcc-lib directory\n-@cindex directories, gcc-lib\n-@item lib/gcc-lib\n-This is the directory containing the ``private'' files\n-installed by and for @code{gcc}, @code{g77}, @code{g++},\n-and other GNU compilers.\n-\n-@item lib/gcc-lib/@dots{}/f771\n-This is the actual Fortran compiler.\n-\n-@item lib/gcc-lib/@dots{}/libg2c.a\n-This is the run-time library for @code{g77}-compiled programs.\n-@end table\n-\n-Whether you want to include the slightly updated (and possibly\n-improved) versions of @file{cc1}, @file{cc1plus}, and whatever other\n-binaries get rebuilt with the changes the GNU Fortran distribution\n-makes to the GNU back end, is up to you.\n-These changes are highly unlikely to break any compilers,\n-because they involve doing things like adding to the\n-list of acceptable compiler options\n-(so, for example, @file{cc1plus} accepts, and ignores,\n-options that only @file{f771} actually processes).\n-\n-Please assure users that unless\n-they have a specific need for their existing,\n-older versions of @file{gcc} command,\n-they are unlikely to experience any problems by overwriting\n-it with your version---though they could certainly protect\n-themselves by making backup copies first!\n-\n-Otherwise, users might try and install your binaries\n-in a ``safe'' place, find they cannot compile Fortran\n-programs with your distribution (because, perhaps, they're\n-invoking their old version of the @file{gcc} command,\n-which does not recognize Fortran programs), and assume\n-that your binaries (or, more generally, GNU Fortran\n-distributions in general) are broken, at least for their\n-system.\n-\n-Finally, @strong{please} ask for bug reports to go to you first, at least\n-until you're sure your distribution is widely used and has been\n-well tested.\n-This especially goes for those of you making any\n-changes to the @code{g77} sources to port @code{g77}, e.g. to OS/2.\n-@email{fortran@@gnu.org} has received a fair number of bug\n-reports that turned out to be problems with other peoples' ports\n-and distributions, about which nothing could be done for the\n-user.\n-Once you are quite certain a bug report does not involve\n-your efforts, you can forward it to us.\n-\n-@end ifclear"}, {"sha": "c085aea08ee5b8b50f2cf521c8e710348e0fc7e3", "filename":
