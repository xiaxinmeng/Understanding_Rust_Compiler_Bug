This is fixed with patch 108908-02 for Solaris\n 2.6 and has been fixed in later (5.x) versions of the assembler,\n starting with Solaris 7.\n \n+Starting with Solaris 7, the operating system is capable of executing\n+64-bit SPARC V9 binaries.  GCC 3.0 doesn't properly support this yet.\n+Although some patches or recipes to enable this support have been posted\n+to various newsgroups and mailing lists, we recommend against using\n+them, since the compiler may either crash or, worse, silently generate\n+bad code.  If you really need this capability now, you might try a CVS\n+version of GCC 3.1, which will fully support this.  If all you want is\n+code tuned for the UltraSPARC CPU, you should try the\n+@option{-mtune=ultrasparc} option instead, which should be safe from\n+those bugs and produce code that, unlike full 64-bit code, can still run\n+on non-UltraSPARC machines.\n+\n @html\n </p>\n <hr>"}]}
