find a bug?**\n+\n+* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues).\n+\n+* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.\n+\n+#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**\n+\n+* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.\n+\n+* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.\n+\n+* Before submitting, GCCRS requires copyright assignment. Please read the [Contributing to GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/contribute.html) guide to know more.\n+\n+#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**\n+\n+* Suggest your change in the [Zulip](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com/) and start writing code.\n+\n+* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.\n+\n+#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**\n+\n+* Ask any question about how to use GCCRS in [Zulip](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com/).\n+\n+### **PR Policy**\n+\n+* The PR policy: Everything has to go through a PR\n+  - An exception to this rule will be the merge commits of updating the repo against upstream GCC\n+\n+* Reviewers/Maintainers of the project (aka people who have bors rights) should be pinged for reviews/questions.\n+\n+* A PR can have one or several commits (split should have a technical/logical reason, ie. no fixup-ish commit)\n+\n+* Avoid PR's with merge commit unless there's a good reason\n+\n+* Where possible please add test cases to gcc/testsuite/rust.test for all PRs. Some issues may not be testable via dejagnu/automation such as debug dump changes.\n+\n+* PR's cannot be merged untill clang format and the build and tests pass.\n+\n+* Please take the time to create good git commit messages see the existing format of them in the git log or refer to something like: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\n+\n+Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:\n+\n+GCCRS Team"}]}
