As the library reaches stable plateaus, it is captured in\n-   a snapshot and released. The latest release is [54]the fourteenth\n+   a snapshot and released. The latest release is [56]the fourteenth\n    snapshot but newer versions have been included in recent GCC releases.\n    For those who want to see exactly how far the project has come, or\n    just want the latest bleeding-edge code, the up-to-date source is\n    available over anonymous CVS, and can even be browsed over the Web\n-   (see [55]1.4 below).\n-\n+   (see [57]1.4 below).\n+   \n    The older libstdc++-v2 project is no longer maintained; the code has\n-   been completely replaced and rewritten. [56]If you are using V2, then\n+   been completely replaced and rewritten. [58]If you are using V2, then\n    you need to report bugs to your system vendor, not to the V3 list.\n-\n+   \n    A more formal description of the V3 goals can be found in the official\n-   [57]design document.\n+   [59]design document.\n      _________________________________________________________________\n-\n+   \n 1.2 Why should I use libstdc++?\n \n    The completion of the ISO C++ standardization gave the C++ community a\n    powerful set of reuseable tools in the form of the C++ Standard\n    Library. However, all existing C++ implementations are (as the Draft\n    Standard used to say) \"incomplet and incorrekt,\" and many suffer from\n    limitations of the compilers that use them.\n-\n+   \n    The GNU C/C++/FORTRAN/<pick-a-language> compiler (gcc, g++, etc) is\n    widely considered to be one of the leading compilers in the world. Its\n-   development has recently been taken over by the [58]GCC team. All of\n-   the rapid development and near-legendary [59]portability that are the\n+   development has recently been taken over by the [60]GCC team. All of\n+   the rapid development and near-legendary [61]portability that are the\n    hallmarks of an open-source project are being applied to libstdc++.\n-\n+   \n    That means that all of the Standard classes and functions (such as\n    string, vector<>, iostreams, and algorithms) will be freely available\n    and fully compliant. Programmers will no longer need to \"roll their\n    own\" nor be worried about platform-specific incompatibilities.\n      _________________________________________________________________\n-\n+   \n 1.3 Who's in charge of it?\n \n    The libstdc++ project is contributed to by several developers all over\n    the world, in the same way as GCC or Linux. Benjamin Kosnik, Gabriel\n    Dos Reis, Phil Edwards, Ulrich Drepper, Loren James Rittle, and Paolo\n    Carlini are the lead maintainers of the CVS archive.\n-\n+   \n    Development and discussion is held on the libstdc++ mailing list.\n    Subscribing to the list, or searching the list archives, is open to\n-   everyone. You can read instructions for doing so on the [60]homepage.\n+   everyone. You can read instructions for doing so on the [62]homepage.\n    If you have questions, ideas, code, or are just curious, sign up!\n      _________________________________________________________________\n-\n+   \n 1.4 How do I get libstdc++?\n \n-   The [61]homepage has instructions for retrieving the latest CVS\n+   The [63]homepage has instructions for retrieving the latest CVS\n    sources, and for browsing the CVS sources over the web.\n-\n-   Stable versions of libstdc++-v3 are included with releases of [62]the\n+   \n+   Stable versions of libstdc++-v3 are included with releases of [64]the\n    GCC compilers.\n-\n+   \n    The subset commonly known as the Standard Template Library (chapters\n    23 through 25, mostly) is adapted from the final release of the SGI\n    STL.\n      _________________________________________________________________\n-\n+   \n 1.5 When is libstdc++ going to be finished?\n \n    Nathan Myers gave the best of all possible answers, responding to a\n    Usenet article asking this question: Sooner, if you help.\n      _________________________________________________________________\n-\n+   \n 1.6 How do I contribute to the effort?\n \n-   Here is [63]a page devoted to this topic. Subscribing to the mailing\n+   Here is [65]a page devoted to this topic. Subscribing to the mailing\n    list (see above, or the homepage) is a very good idea if you have\n    something to contribute, or if you have spare time and want to help.\n    Contributions don't have to be in the form of source code; anybody who\n    is willing to help write documentation, for example, or has found a\n    bug in code that we all thought was working, is more than welcome!\n      _________________________________________________________________\n-\n+   \n 1.7 What happened to libg++? I need that!\n \n    The most recent libg++ README states that libg++ is no longer being\n    actively maintained. It should not be used for new projects, and is\n    only being kicked along to support older code.\n-\n+   \n    The libg++ was designed and created when there was no Standard to\n    provide guidance. Classes like linked lists are now provided for by\n    list<T> and do not need to be created by genclass. (For that matter,\n    templates exist now and are well-supported, whereas genclass (mostly)\n    predates them.)\n-\n+   \n    There are other classes in libg++ that are not specified in the ISO\n    Standard (e.g., statistical analysis). While there are a lot of really\n    useful things that are used by a lot of people (e.g., statistics :-),\n    the Standards Committee couldn't include everything, and so a lot of\n    those \"obvious\" classes didn't get included.\n-\n+   \n    Since libstdc++ is an implementation of the Standard Library, we have\n    no plans at this time to include non-Standard utilities in the\n    implementation, however handy they are. (The extensions provided in\n@@ -176,35 +178,35 @@\n    entirely plausable that the \"useful stuff\" from libg++ might be\n    extracted into an updated utilities library, but nobody has started\n    such a project yet.\n-\n-   (The [64]Boost site houses free C++ libraries that do varying things,\n+   \n+   (The [66]Boost site houses free C++ libraries that do varying things,\n    and happened to be started by members of the Standards Committee.\n    Certain \"useful stuff\" classes will probably migrate there.)\n-\n-   For the bold and/or desperate, the [65]GCC extensions page describes\n+   \n+   For the bold and/or desperate, the [67]GCC extensions page describes\n    where to find the last libg++ source.\n      _________________________________________________________________\n-\n+   \n 1.8 What if I have more questions?\n \n    If you have read the README and RELEASE-NOTES files, and your question\n    remains unanswered, then just ask the mailing list.

This library contains only those support routines, one per object\n    file. But if you are using anything from the rest of the library, such\n    as IOStreams or vectors, then you'll still need pieces from\n    libstdc++.a.\n-\n+   \n    The second method is one we hope to incorporate into the library build\n    process. Some platforms can place each function and variable into its\n    own section in a .o file. The GNU linker can then perform garbage\n    collection on unused sections; this reduces the situation to only\n    copying needed functions into the executable, as before, but all\n    happens automatically.\n-\n+   \n    Unfortunately the garbage collection in GNU ld is buggy; sections\n    (corresponding to functions and variables) which are used are\n    mistakenly removed, leading to horrible crashes when your executable\n    starts up.

Configuring and building the library\n    (see above) will still require certain tools, however.
