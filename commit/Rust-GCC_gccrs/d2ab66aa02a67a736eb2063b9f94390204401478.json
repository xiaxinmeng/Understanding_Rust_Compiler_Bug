The runtime has\n-been completely rewritten in gcc 2.4.  The earlier runtime had several\n-severe bugs and was rather incomplete.  The compiler has had several\n-new features added as well.\n-\n-This is not documentation for Objective C, it is usable to someone\n-who knows Objective C from somewhere else.\n-\n-\n-Runtime API functions\n-=====================\n-\n-The runtime is modeled after the NeXT Objective C runtime.  That is,\n-most functions have semantics as it is known from the NeXT.  The\n-names, however, have changed.  All runtime API functions have names\n-of lowercase letters and underscores as opposed to the\n-`traditional' mixed case names.  \n-\tThe runtime api functions are not documented as of now.\n-Someone offered to write it, and did it, but we were not allowed to\n-use it by his university (Very sad story).  We have started writing\n-the documentation over again.  This will be announced in appropriate\n-places when it becomes available.\n-\n-\n-Protocols\n-=========\n-\n-Protocols are now fully supported.  The semantics is exactly as on the\n-NeXT.  There is a flag to specify how protocols should be typechecked\n-when adopted to classes.  The normal typechecker requires that all\n-methods in a given protocol must be implemented in the class that\n-adopts it -- it is not enough to inherit them.  The flag\n-`-Wno-protocol' causes it to allow inherited methods, while\n-`-Wprotocols' is the default which requires them defined.\n-\n-\n-+initialize \n-===========\n-\n-This method, if defined, is called before any other instance or class\n-methods of that particular class.  This method is not inherited, and\n-is thus not called as initializer for a subclass that doesn't define\n-it itself.  Thus, each +initialize method is called exactly once (or\n-never if no methods of that particular class is never called).\n-Besides this, it is allowed to have several +initialize methods, one\n-for each category.  The order in which these (multiple methods) are\n-called is not well defined.  I am not completely certain what the\n-semantics of this method is for other implementations, but this is\n-how it works for GNU Objective C.\n-\n-\n-Passivation/Activation/Typedstreams\n-===================================\n-\n-This is supported in the style of NeXT TypedStream's.  Consult the\n-headerfile Typedstreams.h for api functions.  I (Kresten) have\n-rewritten it in Objective C, but this implementation is not part of\n-2.4, it is available from the GNU Objective C prerelease archive. \n-   There is one difference worth noting concerning objects stored with\n-objc_write_object_reference (aka NXWriteObjectReference).  When these\n-are read back in, their object is not guaranteed to be available until\n-the `-awake' method is called in the object that requests that object.\n-To objc_read_object you must pass a pointer to an id, which is valid\n-after exit from the function calling it (like e.g. an instance\n-variable).  In general, you should not use objects read in until the\n--awake method is called.\n-\n-\n-Acknowledgements\n-================\n-\n-The GNU Objective C team: Geoffrey Knauth <gsk@marble.com> (manager),\n-Tom Wood <wood@next.com> (compiler) and Kresten Krab Thorup\n-<krab@iesd.auc.dk> (runtime) would like to thank a some people for\n-participating in the development of the present GNU Objective C.\n-\n-Paul Burchard <burchard@geom.umn.edu> and Andrew McCallum\n-<mccallum@cs.rochester.edu> has been very helpful debugging the\n-runtime.   Eric Herring <herring@iesd.auc.dk> has been very helpful\n-cleaning up after the documentation-copyright disaster and is now\n-helping with the new documentation.\n-\n-Steve Naroff <snaroff@next.com> and Richard Stallman\n-<rms@gnu.ai.mit.edu> has been very helpful with implementation details\n-in the compiler.\n-\n-\n-Bug Reports\n-===========\n-\n-Please read the section `Submitting Bugreports' of the gcc manual\n-before you submit any bugs."}]}
