specified, @code{gcc}, @code{g77},\n-and other GNU compilers that incorporate the @code{gcc}\n-back end as modified by @code{g77}, issue\n-a warning about integer division by constant zero.\n-\n-@item\n-New option @samp{-Wno-globals} disables warnings\n-about ``suspicious'' use of a name both as a global\n-name and as the implicit name of an intrinsic, and\n-warnings about disagreements over the number or natures of\n-arguments passed to global procedures, or the\n-natures of the procedures themselves.\n-\n-The default is to issue such warnings, which are\n-new as of this version of @code{g77}.\n-\n-@item\n-New option @samp{-fno-globals} disables diagnostics\n-about potentially fatal disagreements\n-analysis problems, such as disagreements over the\n-number or natures of arguments passed to global\n-procedures, or the natures of those procedures themselves.\n-\n-The default is to issue such diagnostics and flag\n-the compilation as unsuccessful.\n-With this option, the diagnostics are issued as\n-warnings, or, if @samp{-Wno-globals} is specified,\n-are not issued at all.\n-\n-This option also disables inlining of global procedures,\n-to avoid compiler crashes resulting from coding errors\n-that these diagnostics normally would identify.\n-\n-@item\n-Fix @code{libU77} routines that accept file and other names\n-to strip trailing blanks from them, for consistency\n-with other implementations.\n-Blanks may be forcibly appended to such names by\n-appending a single null character (@samp{CHAR(0)})\n-to the significant trailing blanks.\n-\n-@item\n-Fix @code{CHMOD} intrinsic to work with file names\n-that have embedded blanks, commas, and so on.\n-\n-@item\n-Fix @code{SIGNAL} intrinsic so it accepts an\n-optional third @samp{Status} argument.\n-\n-@item\n-Make many changes to @code{libU77} intrinsics to\n-support existing code more directly.\n-\n-Such changes include allowing both subroutine and\n-function forms of many routines, changing @code{MCLOCK()}\n-and @code{TIME()} to return @code{INTEGER(KIND=1)} values,\n-introducing @code{MCLOCK8()} and @code{TIME8()} to\n-return @code{INTEGER(KIND=2)} values,\n-and placing functions that are intended to perform\n-side effects in a new intrinsic group, @code{badu77}.\n-\n-@item\n-Add options @samp{-fbadu77-intrinsics-delete},\n-@samp{-fbadu77-intrinsics-hide},

@code{stdout}.\n-\n-@item\n-The @samp{.r} suffix now designates a Ratfor source file,\n-to be preprocessed via the @code{ratfor} command, available\n-separately.\n-@end itemize\n-\n-@heading In 0.5.20:\n-@itemize @bullet\n-@item\n-The @samp{-fno-typeless-boz} option is now the default.\n-\n-This option specifies that non-decimal-radix\n-constants using the prefixed-radix form (such as @samp{Z'1234'})\n-are to be interpreted as @code{INTEGER(KIND=1)} constants.\n-Specify @samp{-ftypeless-boz} to cause such\n-constants to be interpreted as typeless.\n-\n-(Version 0.5.19 introduced

@samp{-ff90-intrinsics-enable} and\n-@samp{-fvxt-intrinsics-enable} now are the\n-defaults.\n-\n-Some programs might use names that clash with\n-intrinsic names defined (and now enabled) by these\n-options or by the new @code{libU77} intrinsics.\n-Users of such programs might need to compile them\n-differently (using, for example, @samp{-ff90-intrinsics-disable})\n-or, better yet, insert appropriate @code{EXTERNAL}\n-statements specifying that these names are not intended\n-to be names of intrinsics.\n-\n-@item\n-The @samp{ALWAYS_FLUSH} macro is no longer defined when\n-building @code{libf2c}, which should result in improved\n-I/O performance, especially over NFS.\n-\n-@emph{Note:} If you have code that depends on the behavior\n-of @code{libf2c} when built with @samp{ALWAYS_FLUSH} defined,\n-you will have to modify @code{libf2c} accordingly before\n-building it from this and future versions of @code{g77}.\n-\n-@xref{Output Assumed To Flush}, for more information.\n-\n-@item\n-Dave Love's implementation of @code{libU77} has been\n-added to the version of @code{libf2c} distributed with\n-and built as part of @code{g77}.\n-@code{g77} now knows about the routines in this library\n-as intrinsics.\n-\n-@item\n-New option @samp{-fvxt} specifies that the\n-source file is written in VXT Fortran, instead of GNU Fortran.\n-\n-@xref{VXT Fortran}, for more information on the constructs\n-recognized when the @samp{-fvxt} option is specified.\n-\n-@item\n-The @samp{-fvxt-not-f90} option has been deleted,\n-along with its inverse, @samp{-ff90-not-vxt}.\n-\n-If you used one of these deleted options, you should\n-re-read the pertinent documentation to determine which\n-options, if any, are appropriate for compiling your\n-code with this version of @code{g77}.\n-\n-@xref{Other Dialects}, for more information.\n-\n-@item\n-The @samp{-fugly} option now issues a warning, as it\n-likely will be removed in a future version.\n-\n-(Enabling all the @samp{-fugly-*} options is unlikely\n-to be feasible, or sensible, in the future,\n-so users should learn to specify only those\n-@samp{-fugly-*} options they really need for a\n-particular source file.)\n-\n-@item\n-The @samp{-fugly-assumed} option, introduced in\n-version 0.5.19, has been changed to\n-better accommodate old and new code.\n-@xref{Ugly Assumed-Size Arrays}, for more information.\n-\n-@item\n-Related to supporting Alpha (AXP) machines, the @code{LOC()}\n-intrinsic and @code{%LOC()} construct now return\n-values of @code{INTEGER(KIND=0)} type,\n-as defined by the GNU Fortran language.\n-\n-This type is wide enough\n-(holds the same number of bits)\n-as the character-pointer type on the machine.\n-\n-On most machines, this won't make a difference,\n-whereas, on Alphas and other systems with 64-bit pointers,\n-the @code{INTEGER(KIND=0)} type is equivalent to @code{INTEGER(KIND=2)}\n-(often referred to as @code{INTEGER*8})\n-instead of the more common @code{INTEGER(KIND=1)}\n-(often referred to as @code{INTEGER*4}).\n-\n-@item\n-Emulate @code{COMPLEX} arithmetic in the @code{g77} front\n-end, to avoid bugs in @code{complex} support in the\n-@code{gcc} back end.\n-New option @samp{-fno-emulate-complex}\n-causes @code{g77} to revert the 0.5.19 behavior.\n-\n-@item\n-Dummy arguments are no longer assumed to potentially alias\n-(overlap)\n-other dummy arguments or @code{COMMON} areas when any of\n-these are defined (assigned to) by Fortran code.\n-\n-This can result in faster and/or smaller programs when\n-compiling with optimization enabled, though on some\n-systems this effect is observed only when @samp{-fforce-addr}\n-also is specified.\n-\n-New options @samp{-falias-check}, @samp{-fargument-alias},\n-@samp{-fargument-noalias},\n-and @samp{-fno-argument-noalias-global} control the\n-way @code{g77} handles potential aliasing.\n-\n-@xref{Aliasing Assumed To Work}, for detailed information on why the\n-new defaults might result in some programs no longer working the way they\n-did when compiled by previous versions of @code{g77}.\n-\n-@item\n-New option @samp{-fugly-assign} specifies that the\n-same memory locations are to be used to hold the\n-values assigned by both statements @samp{I = 3} and\n-@samp{ASSIGN 10 TO I}, for example.\n-(Normally, @code{g77} uses a separate memory location\n-to hold assigned statement labels.)\n-\n-@xref{Ugly Assigned Labels}, for more information.\n-\n-@item\n-@code{FORMAT} and @code{ENTRY} statements now are allowed to\n-precede @code{IMPLICIT NONE} statements.\n-\n-@item\n-Enable full support of @code{INTEGER(KIND=2)}\n-(often referred to as @code{INTEGER*8})\n-available in\n-@code{libf2c} and

are\n-specific intrinsics, instead of synonyms for the\n-generic intrinsic @code{REAL}.\n-\n-@item\n-New intrinsics have been added.\n-These are @code{REALPART}, @code{IMAGPART},\n-@code{COMPLEX},\n-@code{LONG}, and @code{SHORT}.\n-\n-@item\n-A new group of intrinsics, @samp{gnu}, has been added\n-to contain the new @code{REALPART}, @code{IMAGPART},\n-and
