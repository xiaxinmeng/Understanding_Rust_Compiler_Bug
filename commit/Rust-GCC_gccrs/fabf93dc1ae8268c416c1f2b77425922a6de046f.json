The reason\nlies in the implementation of the \"=\" operator in GNAT: internally, there\nis not a \"=\" predefined operator for every nonlimited type, but instead\nthere is a single, universal \"=\" predefined operator for all the nonlimited\ntypes.  The consequence is that the hiding rule implemented in GNAT for \"=\"\nis effectively that a user-declared symmetrical \"=\" operator returning\nboolean hides the predefined \"=\" operator of any type that is covered by\nthe user-declared operator.\n\nWhether it is desirable to implement the exact RM rule in GNAT is to be\ndiscussed, but existing code relies on the non-portability and would thus\nneed to be changed.\n\ngcc/ada/\n\n\t* sem_ch6.adb (New_Overloaded_Entity): Deal specifically with the\n\toverriding of the \"=\" operator for tagged types.", "tree": {"sha": "b22d0f62dc7d1cccced5ca7b529d1345f8ab8baa", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/git/trees/b22d0f62dc7d1cccced5ca7b529d1345f8ab8baa"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/git/commits/fabf93dc1ae8268c416c1f2b77425922a6de046f", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/fabf93dc1ae8268c416c1f2b77425922a6de046f", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commit/fabf93dc1ae8268c416c1f2b77425922a6de046f", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/fabf93dc1ae8268c416c1f2b77425922a6de046f/comments", "author": null, "committer": {"login": "pmderodat", "id": 758452, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc1ODQ1Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/758452?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat", "html_url": "https://github.com/pmderodat", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "3e93d2926aeefcffc978005b7964481f351dd494", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/3e93d2926aeefcffc978005b7964481f351dd494", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commit/3e93d2926aeefcffc978005b7964481f351dd494"}], "stats": {"total": 29, "additions": 28, "deletions": 1}, "files": [{"sha": "cb2ed7c5e45bd8cd7ae48c76b6c3c6d8e6215748", "filename": "gcc/ada/sem_ch6.adb", "status": "modified", "additions": 28, "deletions": 1, "changes": 29, "blob_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/fabf93dc1ae8268c416c1f2b77425922a6de046f/gcc%2Fada%2Fsem_ch6.adb", "raw_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/raw/fabf93dc1ae8268c416c1f2b77425922a6de046f/gcc%2Fada%2Fsem_ch6.adb", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/contents/gcc%2Fada%2Fsem_ch6.adb?ref=fabf93dc1ae8268c416c1f2b77425922a6de046f", "patch": "@@ -12303,7 +12303,34 @@ package body Sem_Ch6 is\n                            --  Work done in Override_Dispatching_Operation, so\n                            --  nothing else needs to be done here.\n \n-                           null;\n+                           --  ???
