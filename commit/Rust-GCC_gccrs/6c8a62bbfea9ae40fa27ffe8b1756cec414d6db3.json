With Java\n-applets, in particular, code size is a significant issue.  The standard\n-modem is still not operating at 56 Kbaud, or sometimes even with data\n-compression.  Assuming an uncompressed 28.8 Kbaud modem, only about\n-3 KBytes can be downloaded in one second; compression often doubles\n-that speed, but a V.90 modem may not provide another doubling.  When\n-used with embedded processors, similar size concerns apply.  </p>\n-\n-<p> &AElig;lfred is designed for easy and efficient use over the Internet,\n-based on the following principles: </p> <ol>\n-\n-<li> &AElig;lfred must be as small as possible, so that it doesn't add too\n-   much to an applet's download time. </li>\n-\n-<li> &AElig;lfred must use as few class files as possible, to minimize the\n-   number of HTTP connections necessary.  (The use of JAR files has made this\n-   be less of a concern.) </li>\n-\n-<li> &AElig;lfred must be compatible with most or all Java implementations\n-   and platforms. (Write once, run anywhere.) </li>\n-\n-<li> &AElig;lfred must use as little memory as possible, so that it does\n-   not take away resources from the rest of your program.  (It doesn't force\n-   you to use DOM or a similar costly data structure API.)</li>\n-\n-<li> &AElig;lfred must run as fast as possible, so that it does not slow down\n-   the rest of your program. </li>\n-\n-<li> &AElig;lfred must produce correct output for well-formed and valid\n-   documents, but need not reject every document that is not valid or\n-   not well-formed. (In &AElig;lfred2, correctness was a bigger concern\n-   than in the original version; and a validation option is available.) </li>\n-\n-<li> &AElig;lfred must provide full internationalization from the first\n-    release.  (&AElig;lfred2 now automatically handles all encodings\n-    supported by the underlying JVM; previous versions handled only\n-    UTF-8, UTF_16, ASCII, and ISO-8859-1.)</li>\n-\n-</ol>\n-\n-<p>As you can see from this list, &AElig;lfred is designed for production\n-use, but neither validation nor perfect conformance was a requirement.\n-Good validating parsers exist, including one in this package,\n-and you should use them as appropriate.  (See conformance reviews\n-available at <a href=\"http://www.xml.com/\">http://www.xml.com</a>)\n-</p>\n-\n-<p> One of the main goals of &AElig;lfred2 was to significantly improve\n-conformance, while not significantly affecting the other goals stated above.\n-Since the only use of this parser is with SAX, some classes could be\n-removed, and so the overall size of &AElig;lfred was actually reduced.\n-Subsequent performance work produced a notable speedup (over twenty\n-percent on larger files).  That is, the tradeoffs between speed, size, and\n-conformance were re-targeted towards conformance and support of newer APIs\n-(SAX2), with a a positive performance impact. </p>\n-\n-<p> The role anticipated for this version of &AElig;lfred is as a\n-lightweight Free Software SAX parser that can be used in essentially every\n-Java program where the handful of conformance violations (noted below)\n-are acceptable.\n-That certainly includes applets, and\n-nowadays one must also mention embedded systems as being even more\n-size-critical.\n-At this writing, all parsers that are more conformant are\n-significantly larger, even when counting the optional\n-validation support in this version of &AElig;lfred. </p>\n-\n-\n-<h3><a name=\"name\">About the Name <em>&AElig;lfred</em></a></h3>\n-\n-<p>&AElig;lfred the Great (AElfred in ASCII) was King of Wessex, and\n-some say of King of England, at the time of his death in 899 AD.\n-&AElig;lfred introduced a wide-spread literacy program in the hope that\n-his people would learn to read English, at least, if Latin was too\n-difficult for them.  This &AElig;lfred hopes to bring another sort of\n-literacy to Java, using XML, at least, if full SGML is too difficult.</p>\n-\n-<p>The initial &AElig; ligature (\"AE)\" is also a reminder that XML is\n-not limited to ASCII.</p>\n-\n-\n-<h3><a name=\"encodings\">Character Encodings</a></h3>\n-\n-<p> The &AElig;lfred parser currently builds in support for a handful\n-of input encodings.  Of course these include UTF-8 and UTF-16, which\n-all XML parsers are required to support:</p> <ul>\n-\n-    <li> UTF-8 ... the standard eight bit encoding, used unless\n-    you provide an encoding declaration or a MIME charset tag.</li>\n-\n-    <li> US-ASCII ... an extremely common seven bit encoding,\n-    which happens to be a subset of UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 as well\n-    as many other encodings.  XHTML web pages using US-ASCII\n-    (without an encoding declaration) are probably more\n-    widely interoperable than those in any other encoding. </li>\n-\n-    <li> ISO-8859-1 ... includes accented characters used in\n-    much of western Europe (but excluding the Euro currency\n-    symbol).</li>\n-\n-    <li> UTF-16 ... with several variants, this encodes each\n-    sixteen bit Unicode character in sixteen bits of output.\n-    Variants include UTF-16BE (big endian, no byte order mark),\n-    UTF-16LE (little endian, no byte order mark), and\n-    ISO-10646-UCS-2 (an older and less used encoding, using a\n-    version of Unicode without surrogate pairs).  This is\n-    essentially the native encoding used by Java.  </li>\n-\n-    <li> ISO-10646-UCS-4 ... a seldom-used four byte encoding,\n-    also known as UTF-32BE.  Four byte order variants are supported,\n-    including one known as UTF-32LE.  Some operating systems\n-    standardized on UCS-4 despite its significant size penalty,\n-    in anticipation that Unicode (even with surrogate pairs)\n-    would eventually become limiting.  UCS-4 permits encoding\n-    of non-Unicode characters, which Java can't represent (and\n-    XML doesn't allow).  \n-    </li>\n-\n-    </ul>\n-\n-<p> If you use any encoding other than UTF-8 or UTF-16 you should\n-make sure to label your data appropriately: </p>\n-\n-<blockquote>\n-&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"<b>ISO-8859-15</b>\"?&gt;\n-</blockquote>\n-\n-<p> Encodings accessed through <code>java.io.InputStreamReader</code>\n-are now fully supported for both external labels (such as MIME types)\n-and internal types (as shown above).\n-There is one limitation in the support for internal labels:\n-the encodings must be derived from the US-ASCII encoding,\n-the EBCDIC family of encodings is not recognized.\n-Note that Java defines its\n-own encoding names, which don't always correspond to the standard\n-Internet encoding names defined by the IETF/IANA, and that Java\n-may even <em>require</em> use of nonstandard encoding names.\n-Please report\n-such problems; some of them can be worked around in this parser,\n-and many can be worked around by using external labels.\n-</p>\n-\n-<p>Note that if you are using the Euro symbol with an fixed length\n-eight bit encoding, you should probably be using the encoding label\n-<em>iso-8859-15</em> or, with a Microsoft OS, <em>cp-1252</em>.\n-Of course, UTF-8 and UTF-16 handle the Euro symbol directly.\n-</p>\n-\n-\n-<h3><a name=\"violations\">Known Conformance Violations</a></h3>\n-\n-<p>Known conformance issues should be of negligible importance for \n-most applications, and include: </p><ul>\n-    \n-    <li> Rather than following the voluminous \"Appendix B\" rules about\n-    what characters may appear in names (and name tokens), the Unicode\n-    rules embedded in <em>java.lang.Character</em> are used.\n-    This means mostly that some names are inappropriately accepted,\n-    though a few are inappropriately rejected.  (It's much simpler\n-    to avoid that much special case code.  Recent OASIS/NIST test\n-    cases may have these rules be realistically testable.) </li>\n-\n-    <li> Text containing \"]]&gt;\" is not rejected unless it fully resides\n-    in an internal buffer ... which is, thankfully, the typical case.  This\n-    text is illegal, but sometimes appears in illegal attempts to\n-    nest CDATA sections.  (Not catching that boundary condition\n-    substantially simplifies parsing text.) </li>\n-\n-    <li> Surrogate characters that aren't correctly paired are ignored\n-    rather than rejected, unless they were encoded using UTF-8.  (This\n-    simplifies parsing text.)  Unicode 3.1 assigned the first characters\n-    to those character codes, in early 2001, so few documents (or tools)\n-    use such characters in any case. </li>\n-\n-    <li> Declarations following references to an undefined parameter\n-    entity reference are not ignored. (Not maintaining and using state\n-    about this validity error simplifies declaration handling; few\n-    XML parsers address this constraint in any case.) </li>\n-\n-    <li> Well formedness constraints for general entity references\n-    are not enforced.  (The code to handle the \"content\" production\n-    is merged with the element parsing code, making it hard to reuse\n-    for this additional situation.) </li>\n-\n-</ul>\n-\n-<p> When tested against the July 12, 1999 version of the OASIS\n-XML Conformance test suite, an earlier version passed 1057 of 1067 tests.\n-That contrasts with the original version, which passed 867.  The\n-current parser is top-ranked in terms of conformance, as is its\n-validating sibling (which has some additional conformance violations\n-imposed on it by SAX2 API deficiencies as well as some of the more\n-curious SGML layering artifacts found in the XML specification). </p>\n-\n-<p> The XML 1.0 specification itself was not without problems,\n-and after some delays the W3C has come out with a revised\n-\"second edition\" specification.  While that doesn't resolve all\n-the problems identified the XML specification, many of the most\n-egregious problems have been resolved.  (You still need to drink\n-magic Kool-Aid before some DTD-related issues make sense.)\n-To the extent possible, this parser conforms to that second\n-edition specification, and does well against corrected versions\n-of the OASIS/NIST XML conformance test cases.

All of it has been updated. </p>\n-\n-</p>\n-\n-\n-<h2><a name=\"changes\">Changes Since the last Microstar Release</a></h2>\n-\n-<p> As noted above, Microstar has not updated this parser since\n-the summer of 1998, when it released version 1.2a on its web site.\n-This release is intended to benefit the developer community by\n-refocusing the API on SAX2, and improving conformance to the extent\n-that most developers should not need to use another XML parser.  </p>\n-\n-<p> The code has been cleaned up (referring to the XML 1.0 spec in\n-all the production numbers in \n-comments, rather than some preliminary draft, for one example) and\n-has been sped up a bit as well.\n-JAXP support has been added, although developers are still\n-strongly encouraged to use the SAX2 APIs directly.  </p>\n-\n-\n-<h3><a name=\"sax2\">SAX2 Support</a></h3>\n-\n-<p> The original version of &AElig;lfred did not support the\n-SAX2 APIs. </p>\n-\n-<p> This version supports the SAX2 APIs, exposing the standard\n-boolean feature descriptors.  It supports the \"DeclHandler\" property\n-to provide access to all DTD declarations not already exposed\n-through the SAX1 API.  The \"LexicalHandler\" property is supported,\n-exposing entity boundaries (including the unnamed external subset) and\n-things like comments and CDATA boundaries.

There is now a <a href=\"XmlReader.html\">XmlReader</a> class\n-which combines that class and this enhanced &AElig;lfred parser, creating\n-an optionally validating SAX2 parser. </p>\n-\n-<p> As noted in the documentation for that validating component, certain\n-validity constraints can't reliably be tested by a layered validator.\n-These include all constraints relying on\n-layering violations (exposing XML at the level of tokens or below,\n-required since XML isn't a context-free grammar), some that\n-SAX2 doesn't support, and a few others.  The resulting validating\n-parser is conformant enough for most applications that aren't doing\n-strange SGML tricks with DTDs.\n-Moreover, that validating filter can be used without\n-a parser ... any application component that emits SAX event streams\n-can DTD-validate its output on demand. </p>\n-\n-<h3><a name=\"smaller\">You want Smaller?</a></h3>\n-\n-<p> You'll have noticed that the original version of &AElig;lfred\n-had small size as a top goal.  &AElig;lfred2 normally includes a\n-DTD validation layer, but you can package without that.\n-Similarly, JAXP factory support is available but optional.\n-Then the main added cost due to this revision are for\n-supporting the SAX2 API itself; DTD validation is as\n-cleanly layered as allowed by SAX2.</p>\n-\n-<h3><a name=\"bugfixes\">Bugs Fixed</a></h3>\n-\n-<p> Bugs fixed in &AElig;lfred2 include: </p>\n-\n-<ol>\n-    <li> Originally &AElig;lfred didn't close file descriptors, which\n-    led to file descriptor leakage on programs which ran for any\n-    length of time. </li>\n-\n-    <li> NOTATION declarations without system identifiers are\n-    now handled correctly. </li>\n-\n-    <li> DTD events are now reported for all invocations of a\n-    given parser, not just the first one. </li>\n-\n-    <li> More correct character handling: <ul>\n-\n-\t<li> Rejects out-of-range characters, both in text and in\n-\tcharacter references. </li>\n-\n-\t<li> Correctly handles character references that expand to\n-\tsurrogate pairs. </li>\n-\n-\t<li> Correctly handles UTF-8 encodings of surrogate pairs. </li>\n-\n-\t<li> Correctly handles Unicode 3.1 rules about illegal UTF-8\n-\tencodings: there is only one legal encoding per character. </li>\n-\n-\t<li> PUBLIC identifiers are now rejected if they have illegal\n-\tcharacters. </li>\n-\n-\t<li> The parser is more correct about what characters are allowed\n-\tin names and name tokens.

Why have\n-another?  Some of the goals of this version:\n-</p>\n-\n-<ul>\n-<li>Advanced DOM support. This was the first generally available\n-implementation of DOM Level 2 in Java, and one of the first Level 3\n-and XPath implementations.</li>\n-\n-<li> Free Software.  This one is distributed under the GPL (with\n-\"library exception\") so it can be used with a different class of\n-application.</li>\n-\n-<li>Second implementation syndrome.  I can do it simpler this time\n-around ... and heck, writing it only takes a bit over a day once you\n-know your way around.</li>\n-\n-<li>Sanity check the then-current Last Call DOM draft.  Best to find\n-bugs early, when they're relatively fixable.  Yes, bugs were found.</li>\n-\n-<li>Modularity.  Most of the implementations mentioned above are part\n-of huge packages; take all (including bugs, of which some have far\n-too many), or take nothing.  I prefer a menu approach, when possible.\n-This code is standalone, not beholden to any particular parser or XSL\n-or XPath code.</li>\n-\n-<li>OK, I'm a hacker, I like to write code.</li>\n-</ul>\n-\n-<p>\n-This also works with the GNU Compiler for Java (GCJ).  GCJ promises\n-to be quite the environment for programming Java, both directly and from\n-C++ using the new CNI interfaces (which really use C++, unlike JNI). </p>\n-\n-\n-<h3>Open Issues</h3>\n-\n-<p>At this writing:</p>\n-<ul>\n-<li>See below for some restrictions on the mutation event\n-support ... some events aren't reported (and likely won't be).</li>\n-\n-<li>More testing and conformance work is needed.</li>\n-\n-<li>We need an XML Schema validator (actually we need validation in the DOM\n-full stop).</li>\n-</ul>\n-\n-<p>\n-I ran a profiler a few times and remove some of the performance hotspots,\n-but it's not tuned.  Reporting mutation events, in particular, is\n-rather costly -- it started at about a 40% penalty for appendNode calls,\n-I've got it down around 12%, but it'll be hard to shrink it much further.\n-The overall code size is relatively small, though you may want to be rid of\n-many of the unused DOM interface classes (HTML, CSS, and so on).\n-</p>\n-\n-\n-<h2><a name=\"features\">Features of this Package</a></h2>\n-\n-<p> Starting with DOM Level 2, you can really see that DOM is constructed\n-as a bunch of optional modules around a core of either XML or HTML\n-functionality.  Different implementations will support different optional\n-modules.  This implementation provides a set of features that should be\n-useful if you're not depending on the HTML functionality (lots of convenience\n-functions that mostly don't buy much except API surface area) and user\n-interface support.  That is, browsers will want more -- but what they\n-need should be cleanly layered over what's already here. </p>\n-\n-<h3> Core Feature Set:  \"XML\" </h3>\n-\n-<p> This DOM implementation supports the \"XML\" feature set, which basically\n-gets you four things over the bare core (which you're officially not supposed\n-to implement except in conjunction with the \"XML\" or \"HTML\" feature).  In\n-order of decreasing utility, those four things are: </p> <ol>\n-\n-    <li> ProcessingInstruction nodes.  These are probably the most\n-    valuable thing. Handy little buggers, in part because all the APIs\n-    you need to use them are provided, and they're designed to let you\n-    escape XML document structure rules in controlled ways.</li>\n-\n-    <li> CDATASection nodes.  These are of of limited utility since CDATA\n-    is just text that prints funny. These are of use to some sorts of\n-    applications, though I encourage folk to not use them. </li>\n-\n-    <li> DocumentType nodes, and associated Notation and Entity nodes.\n-    These appear to be useless.  Briefly, these \"Type\" nodes expose no\n-    typing information.  They're only really usable to expose some lexical\n-    structure that almost every application needs to ignore.  (XML editors\n-    might like to see them, but they need true typing information much more.)\n-    I strongly encourage people not to use these.  </li>\n-\n-    <li> EntityReference nodes can show up.  These are actively annoying,\n-    since they add an extra level of hierarchy, are the cause of most of\n-    the complexity in attribute values, and their contents are immutable.\n-    Avoid these.</li>\n-\n-    </ol>\n-\n-<h3> Optional Feature Sets:  \"Events\", and friends </h3>\n-\n-<p> Events may be one of the more interesting new features in Level 2.\n-This package provides the core feature set and exposes mutation events.\n-No gooey events though; if you want that, write a layered implementation! </p>\n-\n-<p> Three mutation events aren't currently generated:</p> <ul>\n-\n-    <li> <em>DOMSubtreeModified</em> is poorly specified.  Think of this\n-    as generating one such event around the time of finalization, which\n-    is a fully conformant implementation.  This implementation is exactly\n-    as useful as that one. </li>\n-\n-    <li> <em>DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument</em> and\n-    <em>DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument</em> are supposed to get sent to\n-    every node in a subtree that gets removed or inserted (respectively).\n-    This can be <em>extremely costly</em>, and the removal and insertion\n-    processing is already significantly slower due to event reporting.\n-    It's much easier, and more efficient, to have a listener higher in the\n-    tree watch removal and insertion events through the bubbling or capture\n-    mechanisms, than it is to watch for these two events.</li>\n-\n-    </ul>\n-\n-<p> In addition, certain kinds of attribute modification aren't reported.\n-A fix is known, but it couldn't report the previous value of the attribute.\n-More work could fix all of this (as well as reduce the generally high cost\n-of childful attributes), but that's not been done yet. </p>\n-\n-<p> Also, note that it is a <em>Bad Thing&#153;</em> to have the listener\n-for a mutation event change the ancestry for the target of that event.\n-Or to prevent mutation events from bubbling to where they're needed.\n-Just don't do those, OK? </p>\n-\n-<p> As an experimental feature (named \"USER-Events\"), you can provide\n-your own \"user\" events.  Just name them anything starting with \"USER-\"\n-and you're set.  Dispatch them through, bubbling, capturing, or what\n-ever takes your fancy.  One important thing you can't currently do is\n-pass any data (like an object) with those events.  Maybe later there\n-will be a \"UserEvent\" interface letting you get some substantial use\n-out of this mechanism even if you're not \"inside\" of a DOM package.</p>\n-\n-<p> You can create and send HTML events.  Ditto UIEvents.  Since DOM\n-doesn't require a UI, it's the UI's job to send them; perhaps that's\n-part of your application.  </p>\n-\n-<p><em>This package may be built without the ability to report mutation\n-events, gaining a significant speedup in DOM construction time.  However,\n-if that is done then certain other features -- notably node iterators\n-and getElementsByTagname -- will not be available.</em>\n-\n-\n-<h3> Optional Feature:  \"Traversal\" </h3>\n-\n-<p> Each DOM node has all you need to walk to everything connected\n-to that node.  Lightweight, efficient utilities are easily layered on\n-top of just the core APIs. </p>\n-\n-<p> Traversal APIs are an optional part of DOM Level 2, providing\n-a not-so-lightweight way to walk over DOM trees, if your application\n-didn't already have such utilities for use with data represented via\n-DOM.  Implementing this helped debug the (optional) event and mutation\n-event subsystems, so it's provided here.  </p>\n-\n-<p> At this writing, the \"TreeWalker\" interface isn't implemented. </p>\n-\n-\n-\n-<h2><a name='avoid'>DOM Functionality to Avoid</a></h2>\n-\n-<p> For what appear to be a combination of historical and \"committee\n-logic\" reasons, DOM has a number of <em>features which I strongly advise\n-you to avoid using</em> in your library and application code.  These\n-include the following types of DOM nodes; see the documentation for the\n-implementation class for more information: <ul>\n-\n-    <li> CDATASection\n-    (<a href='DomCDATA.html'>DomCDATA</a> class)\n-    ... use normal Text nodes instead, so you don't have to make\n-    every algorithm recognize multiple types of character data\n-\n-    <li> DocumentType\n-    (<a href='DomDoctype.html'>DomDocType</a> class)\n-    ... if this held actual typing information, it might be useful\n-\n-    <li> Entity\n-    (<a href='DomEntity.html'>DomEntity</a> class)\n-    ... neither parsed nor unparsed entities work well in DOM; it\n-    won't even tell you which attributes identify unparsed entities\n-\n-    <li> EntityReference\n-    (<a href='DomEntityReference.html'>DomEntityReference</a> class)\n-    ... permitted implementation variances are extreme, all children\n-    are readonly, and these can interact poorly with namespaces\n-\n-    <li> Notation\n-    (<a href='DomNotation.html'>DomNotation</a> class)\n-    ... only really usable with unparsed entities (which aren't well\n-    supported; see above) or perhaps with PIs after the DTD, not with\n-    NOTATION attributes\n-\n-    </ul>\n-\n-<p> If you really need to use unparsed entities or notations, use SAX;\n-it offers better support for all DTD-related functionality.\n-It also exposes actual\n-document typing information (such as element content models).</p>\n-\n-<p> Also, when accessing attribute values, use methods that provide their\n-values as single strings, rather than those which expose value substructure\n-(Text and EntityReference nodes).  (See the <a href='DomAttr.html'>DomAttr</a>\n-documentation for more information.) </p>\n-\n-<p> Note that many of these features were provided as partial support for\n-editor functionality (including the incomplete DTD access).  Full editor\n-functionality requires access to potentially malformed lexical structure,\n-at the level of unparsed tokens and below.  Access at such levels is so\n-complex that using it in non-editor applications sacrifices all the\n-benefits of XML; editor aplications need extremely specialized APIs. </p>\n-\n-<p> (This isn't a slam against DTDs, note; only against the broken support\n-for them in DOM.  Even despite inclusion of some dubious SGML legacy features\n-such as notations and unparsed entities,\n-and the ongoing proliferation of alternative schema and validation tools,\n-DTDs are still the most widely adopted tool\n-to constrain XML document structure.  \n-Alternative schemes generally focus on data transfer style\n-applications; open document architectures comparable to\n-DocBook 4.0 don't yet exist in the schema world.\n-Feel free to use DTDs; just don't expect DOM to help you.) </p>\n-\n-</body>\n-</html>\n-"}, {"sha": "352f4c87c2cc491acbe06f2bc27a99738a1c6dd8", "filename": "libjava/gnu/xml/pipeline/package.html", "status": "removed", "additions": 0, "deletions": 255, "changes": 255, "blob_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/86979811f3433ff5778aa71689c7ef3459903516/libjava%2Fgnu%2Fxml%2Fpipeline%2Fpackage.html", "raw_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/raw/86979811f3433ff5778aa71689c7ef3459903516/libjava%2Fgnu%2Fxml%2Fpipeline%2Fpackage.html", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/contents/libjava%2Fgnu%2Fxml%2Fpipeline%2Fpackage.html?ref=86979811f3433ff5778aa71689c7ef3459903516", "patch": "@@ -1,255 +0,0 @@\n-<html><head><title>\n-blah\n-<!--\n-/*\n- * Copyright (C) 1999-2001 The Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n- */\n--->\n-</title></head><body>\n-\n-<p>This package exposes a kind of XML processing pipeline, based on sending\n-SAX events, which can be used as components of application architectures.\n-Pipelines are used to convey streams of processing events from a producer\n-to one or more consumers, and to let each consumer control the data seen by\n-later consumers.\n-\n-<p> There is a <a href=\"PipelineFactory.html\">PipelineFactory</a> class which\n-accepts a syntax describing how to construct some simple pipelines.  Strings\n-describing such pipelines can be used in command line tools (see the\n-<a href=\"../util/DoParse.html\">DoParse</a> class)\n-and in other places that it is\n-useful to let processing be easily reconfigured.  Pipelines can of course\n-be constructed programmatically, providing access to options that the\n-factory won't.\n-\n-<p> Web applications are supported by making it easy for servlets (or\n-non-Java web application components) to be part of a pipeline.  They can\n-originate XML (or XHTML) data through an <em>InputSource</em> or in\n-response to XML messages sent from clients using <em>CallFilter</em>\n-pipeline stages.  Such facilities are available using the simple syntax\n-for pipeline construction.\n-\n-\n-<h2> Programming Models </h2>\n-\n-<p> Pipelines should be simple to understand.\n-\n-<ul>\n-    <li> XML content, typically entire documents,\n-    is pushed through consumers by producers.\n-\n-    <li> Pipelines are basically about consuming SAX2 callback events,\n-    where the events encapsulate XML infoset-level data.<ul>\n-\n-\t<li> Pipelines are constructed by taking one or more consumer\n-\tstages and combining them to produce a composite consumer.\n-\n-\t<li> A pipeline is presumed to have pending tasks and state from\n-\tthe beginning of its ContentHandler.startDocument() callback until\n-\tit's returned from its ContentHandler.doneDocument() callback.\n-\n-\t<li> Pipelines may have multiple output stages (\"fan-out\")\n-\tor multiple input stages (\"fan-in\") when appropriate.\n-\n-\t<li> Pipelines may be long-lived, but need not be.\n-\n-\t</ul>\n-\n-    <li> There is flexibility about event production. <ul>\n-\n-\t<li> SAX2 XMLReader objects are producers, which\n-\tprovide a high level \"pull\" model: documents (text or DOM) are parsed,\n-\tand the parser pushes individual events through the pipeline.\n-\n-\t<li> Events can be pushed directly to event consumer components\n-\tby application modules, if they invoke SAX2 callbacks directly.\n-\tThat is, application modules use the XML Infoset as exposed\n-\tthrough SAX2 event callbacks.\n-\n-\t</ul>\n-    \n-    <li> Multiple producer threads may concurrently access a pipeline,\n-    if they coordinate appropriately.\n-\n-    <li> Pipeline processing is not the only framework applications\n-    will use.\n-\n-    </ul>\n-\n-\n-<h3> Producers: XMLReader or Custom </h3>\n-\n-<p> Many producers will be SAX2 XMLReader objects, and\n-will read (pull) data which is then written (pushed) as events.\n-Typically these will parse XML text (acquired from\n-<code>org.xml.sax.helpers.XMLReaderFactory</code>) or a DOM tree\n-(using a <code><a href=\"../util/DomParser.html\">DomParser</a></code>)\n-These may be bound to event consumer using a convenience routine,\n-<em><a href=\"EventFilter.html\">EventFilter</a>.bind()</em>.\n-Once bound, these producers may be given additional documents to\n-sent through its pipeline.\n-\n-<p> In other cases, you will write producers yourself.  For example, some\n-data structures might know how to write themselves out using one or\n-more XML models, expressed as sequences of SAX2 event callbacks.\n-An application module might\n-itself be a producer, issuing startDocument and endDocument events\n-and then asking those data structures to write themselves out to a\n-given EventConsumer, or walking data structures (such as JDBC query\n-results) and applying its own conversion rules.  WAP format XML\n-(WBMXL) can be directly converted to producer output.\n-\n-<p> SAX2 introduced an \"XMLFilter\" interface, which is a kind of XMLReader.\n-It is most useful in conjunction with its XMLFilterImpl helper class;\n-see the <em><a href=\"EventFilter.html\">EventFilter</a></em> javadoc\n-for information contrasting that XMLFilterImpl approach with the\n-relevant parts of this pipeline framework.  Briefly, such XMLFilterImpl\n-children can be either producers or consumers, and are more limited in\n-configuration flexibility.  In this framework, the focus of filters is\n-on the EventConsumer side; see the section on\n-<a href=\"#fitting\">pipe fitting</a> below.\n-\n-\n-<h3> Consume to Standard or Custom Data Representations </h3>\n-\n-<p> Many consumers will be used to create standard representations of XML\n-data.  The <a href=\"TextConsumer.html\">TextConsumer</a> takes its events\n-and writes them as text for a single XML document,\n-using an internal <a href=\"../util/XMLWriter.html\">XMLWriter</a>.\n-The <a href=\"DomConsumer.html\">DomConsumer</a> takes its events and uses\n-them to create and populate a DOM Document.\n-\n-<p> In other cases, you will write consumers yourself.  For example,\n-you might use a particular unmarshaling filter to produce objects\n-that fit your application's requirements, instead of using DOM.\n-Such consumers work at the level of XML data models, rather than with\n-specific representations such as XML text or a DOM tree.  You could\n-convert your output directly to WAP format data (WBXML).\n-\n-\n-<h3><a name=\"fitting\">Pipe Fitting</a></h3>\n-\n-<p> Pipelines are composite event consumers, with each stage having\n-the opportunity to transform the data before delivering it to any\n-subsequent stages.\n-\n-<p> The <a href=\"PipelineFactory.html\">PipelineFactory</a> class\n-provides access to much of this functionality through a simple syntax.\n-See the table in that class's javadoc describing a number of standard\n-components.  Direct API calls are still needed for many of the most\n-interesting pipeline configurations, including ones leveraging actual\n-or logical concurrency.\n-\n-<p> Four basic types of pipe fitting are directly supported.  These may\n-be used to construct complex pipeline networks.  <ul>\n-\n-    <li> <a href=\"TeeConsumer.html\">TeeConsumer</a> objects split event\n-    flow so it goes to two two different consumers, one before the other.\n-    This is a basic form of event fan-out; you can use this class to\n-    copy events to any number of output pipelines.\n-\n-    <li> Clients can call remote components through HTTP or HTTPS using\n-    the <a href=\"CallFilter.html\">CallFilter</a> component, and Servlets\n-    can implement such components by extending the\n-    <a href=\"XmlServlet.html\">XmlServlet</a> component.  Java is not\n-    required on either end, and transport protocols other than HTTP may\n-    also be used.\n-\n-    <li> <a href=\"EventFilter.html\">EventFilter</a> objects selectively\n-    provide handling for callbacks, and can pass unhandled ones to a\n-    subsequent stage.  They are often subclassed, since much of the\n-    basic filtering machinery is already in place in the base class.\n-\n-    <li> Applications can merge two event flows by just using the same\n-    consumer in each one.  If multiple threads are in use, synchronization\n-    needs to be addressed by the appropriate application level policy.\n-\n-    </ul>\n-\n-<p> Note that filters can be as complex as\n-<a href=\"XsltFilter.html\">XSLT transforms</a>\n-available) on input data, or as simple as removing simple syntax data\n-such as ignorable whitespace, comments, and CDATA delimiters.\n-Some simple \"built-in\" filters are part of this package.\n-\n-\n-<h3> Coding Conventions:  Filter and Terminus Stages</h3>\n-\n-<p> If you follow these coding conventions, your classes may be used\n-directly (give the full class name) in pipeline descriptions as understood\n-by the PipelineFactory.  There are four constructors the factory may\n-try to use; in order of decreasing numbers of parameters, these are: <ul>\n-\n-    <li> Filters that need a single String setup parameter should have\n-    a public constructor with two parameters:  that string, then the\n-    EventConsumer holding the \"next\" consumer to get events.\n-\n-    <li> Filters that don't need setup parameters should have a public\n-    constructor that accepts a single EventConsumer holding the \"next\"\n-    consumer to get events when they are done.\n-\n-    <li> Terminus stages may have a public constructor taking a single\n-    paramter:  the string value of that parameter.\n-\n-    <li> Terminus stages may have a public no-parameters constructor.\n-\n-    </ul>\n-\n-<p> Of course, classes may support more than one such usage convention;\n-if they do, they can automatically be used in multiple modes.  If you\n-try to use a terminus class as a filter, and that terminus has a constructor\n-with the appropriate number of arguments, it is automatically wrapped in\n-a \"tee\" filter.\n-\n-\n-<h2> Debugging Tip: \"Tee\" Joints can Snapshot Data</h2>\n-\n-<p> It can sometimes be hard to see what's happening, when something\n-goes wrong.  Easily fixed:  just snapshot the data.  Then you can find\n-out where things start to go wrong.\n-\n-<p> If you're using pipeline descriptors so that they're easily\n-administered, just stick a <em>write&nbsp;(&nbsp;filename&nbsp;)</em>\n-filter into the pipeline at an appropriate point.\n-\n-<p> Inside your programs, you can do the same thing directly: perhaps\n-by saving a Writer (perhaps a StringWriter) in a variable, using that\n-to create a TextConsumer, and making that the first part of a tee --\n-splicing that into your pipeline at a convenient location.\n-\n-<p> You can also use a DomConsumer to buffer the data, but remember\n-that DOM doesn't save all the information that XML provides, so that DOM\n-snapshots are relatively low fidelity.  They also are substantially more\n-expensive in terms of memory than a StringWriter holding similar data.\n-\n-<h2> Debugging Tip: Non-XML Producers</h2>\n-\n-<p> Producers in pipelines don't need to start from XML\n-data structures, such as text in XML syntax (likely coming\n-from some <em>XMLReader</em> that parses XML) or a\n-DOM representation (perhaps with a\n-<a href=\"../util/DomParser.html\">DomParser</a>).\n-\n-<p> One common type of event producer will instead make\n-direct calls to SAX event handlers returned from an\n-<a href=\"EventConsumer.html\">EventConsumer</a>.\n-For example, making <em>ContentHandler.startElement</em>\n-calls and matching <em>ContentHandler.endElement</em> calls.\n-\n-<p> Applications making such calls can catch certain\n-common \"syntax errors\" by using a\n-<a href=\"WellFormednessFilter.html\">WellFormednessFilter</a>.\n-That filter will detect (and report) erroneous input data\n-such as mismatched document, element, or CDATA start/end calls.\n-Use such a filter near the head of the pipeline that your\n-producer feeds, at least while debugging, to help ensure that\n-you're providing legal XML Infoset data.\n-\n-<p> You can also arrange to validate data on the fly.\n-For DTD validation, you can configure a\n-<a href=\"ValidationConsumer.html\">ValidationConsumer</a>\n-to work as a filter, using any DTD you choose.\n-Other validation schemes can be handled with other\n-validation filters.\n-\n-</body></html>"}, {"sha": "d4355966c5998a40659372eb76118230a56cf36f", "filename": "libjava/gnu/xml/transform/package.html", "status": "removed", "additions": 0, "deletions": 77, "changes": 77, "blob_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/86979811f3433ff5778aa71689c7ef3459903516/libjava%2Fgnu%2Fxml%2Ftransform%2Fpackage.html", "raw_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/raw/86979811f3433ff5778aa71689c7ef3459903516/libjava%2Fgnu%2Fxml%2Ftransform%2Fpackage.html", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/contents/libjava%2Fgnu%2Fxml%2Ftransform%2Fpackage.html?ref=86979811f3433ff5778aa71689c7ef3459903516", "patch": "@@ -1,77 +0,0 @@\n-<html>\n-<body>\n-\n-<h1>GNU JAXP XSL transformer</h1>\n-\n-<div>\n-This package contains a Java XSL transformer compliant with the JAXP\n-specification.

FlatteningPathIterator</h1>\n-\n-<p><i><a href=\"http://www.dandelis.ch/people/brawer/\">Sascha\n-Brawer</a>, November 2003</i></p>\n-\n-<p>This document describes the GNU implementation of the class\n-<code>java.awt.geom.FlatteningPathIterator</code>. It does\n-<em>not</em> describe how a programmer should use this class; please\n-refer to the generated API documentation for this purpose. Instead, it\n-is intended for maintenance programmers who want to understand the\n-implementation, for example because they want to extend the class or\n-fix a bug.</p>\n-\n-\n-<h2>Data Structures</h2>\n-\n-<p>The algorithm uses a stack. Its allocation is delayed to the time\n-when the source path iterator actually returns the first curved\n-segment (either <code>SEG_QUADTO</code> or <code>SEG_CUBICTO</code>).\n-If the input path does not contain any curved segments, the value of\n-the <code>stack</code> variable stays <code>null</code>. In this quite\n-common case, the memory consumption is minimal.</p>\n-\n-<dl><dt><code>stack</code></dt><dd>The variable <code>stack</code> is\n-a <code>double</code> array that holds the start, control and end\n-points of individual sub-segments.</dd>\n-\n-<dt><code>recLevel</code></dt><dd>The variable <code>recLevel</code>\n-holds how many recursive sub-divisions were needed to calculate a\n-segment. The original curve has recursion level 0. For each\n-sub-division, the corresponding recursion level is increased by\n-one.</dd>\n-\n-<dt><code>stackSize</code></dt><dd>Finally, the variable\n-<code>stackSize</code> indicates how many sub-segments are stored on\n-the stack.</dd></dl>\n-\n-<h2>Algorithm</h2>\n-\n-<p>The implementation separately processes each segment that the\n-base iterator returns.</p>\n-\n-<p>In the case of <code>SEG_CLOSE</code>,\n-<code>SEG_MOVETO</code> and <code>SEG_LINETO</code> segments, the\n-implementation simply hands the segment to the consumer, without actually\n-doing anything.</p>\n-\n-<p>Any <code>SEG_QUADTO</code> and <code>SEG_CUBICTO</code> segments\n-need to be flattened. Flattening is performed with a fixed-sized\n-stack, holding the coordinates of subdivided segments. When the base\n-iterator returns a <code>SEG_QUADTO</code> and\n-<code>SEG_CUBICTO</code> segments, it is recursively flattened as\n-follows:</p>\n-\n-<ol><li>Intialization: Allocate memory for the stack (unless a\n-sufficiently large stack has been allocated previously). Push the\n-original quadratic or cubic curve onto the stack. Mark that segment as\n-having a <code>recLevel</code> of zero.</li>\n-\n-<li>If the stack is empty, flattening the segment is complete,\n-and the next segment is fetched from the base iterator.</li>\n-\n-<li>If the stack is not empty, pop a curve segment from the\n-stack.\n-\n-  <ul><li>If its <code>recLevel</code> exceeds the recursion limit,\n-  hand the current segment to the consumer.</li>\n-\n-  <li>Calculate the squared flatness of the segment. If it smaller\n-  than <code>flatnessSq</code>, hand the current segment to the\n-  consumer.</li>\n-\n-  <li>Otherwise, split the segment in two halves. Push the right\n-  half onto the stack. Then, push the left half onto the stack.\n-  Continue with step two.</li></ul></li>\n-</ol>\n-\n-<p>The implementation is slightly complicated by the fact that\n-consumers <em>pull</em> the flattened segments from the\n-<code>FlatteningPathIterator</code>. This means that we actually\n-cannot &#x201c;hand the curent segment over to the consumer.&#x201d;\n-But the algorithm is easier to understand if one assumes a\n-<em>push</em> paradigm.</p>\n-\n-\n-<h2>Example</h2>\n-\n-<p>The following example shows how a\n-<code>FlatteningPathIterator</code> processes a\n-<code>SEG_QUADTO</code> segment. It is (arbitrarily) assumed that the\n-recursion limit was set to 2.</p>\n-\n-<blockquote>\n-<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"8\">\n-  <tr align=\"center\" valign=\"baseline\">\n-
