Through a peculiar turn of events, the\n-version of GNU which is widely used today is more often known as\n-``Linux'', and many users are not aware of the extent of its\n-connection with the GNU Project.\n-\n-There really is a Linux; it is a kernel, and these people are using\n-it.  But you can't use a kernel by itself; a kernel is useful only as\n-part of a whole system.  The system in which Linux is typically used\n-is a modified variant of the GNU system---in other words, a Linux-based\n-GNU system.\n-\n-Many users are not fully aware of the distinction between the kernel,\n-which is Linux, and the whole system, which they also call ``Linux''.\n-The ambiguous use of the name doesn't promote understanding.\n-\n-Programmers generally know that Linux is a kernel.  But since they\n-have generally heard the whole system called ``Linux'' as well, they\n-often envisage a history which fits that name.  For example, many\n-believe that once Linus Torvalds finished writing the kernel, his\n-friends looked around for other free software, and for no particular\n-reason most everything necessary to make a Unix-like system was\n-already available.\n-\n-What they found was no accident---it was the GNU system.  The available\n-free software added up to a complete system because the GNU Project\n-had been working since 1984 to make one.  The GNU Manifesto\n-had set forth the goal of developing a free Unix-like system, called\n-GNU@.  By the time Linux was written, the system was almost finished.\n-\n-Most free software projects have the goal of developing a particular\n-program for a particular job.  For example, Linus Torvalds set out to\n-write a Unix-like kernel (Linux); Donald Knuth set out to write a text\n-formatter (TeX); Bob Scheifler set out to develop a window system (X\n-Windows).  It's natural to measure the contribution of this kind of\n-project by specific programs that came from the project.\n-\n-If we tried to measure the GNU Project's contribution in this way,\n-what would we conclude?  One CD-ROM vendor found that in their ``Linux\n-distribution'', GNU software was the largest single contingent, around\n-28% of the total source code, and this included some of the essential\n-major components without which there could be no system.  Linux itself\n-was about 3%.  So if you were going to pick a name for the system\n-based on who wrote the programs in the system, the most appropriate\n-single choice would be ``GNU''@.\n-\n-But we don't think that is the right way to consider the question.\n-The GNU Project was not, is not, a project to develop specific\n-software packages.  It was not a project to develop a C compiler,\n-although we did.  It was not a project to develop a text editor,\n-although we developed one.  The GNU Project's aim was to develop\n-@emph{a complete free Unix-like system}.\n-\n-Many people have made major contributions to the free software in the\n-system, and they all deserve credit.  But the reason it is @emph{a\n-system}---and not just a collection of useful programs---is because the\n-GNU Project set out to make it one.  We wrote the programs that were\n-needed to make a @emph{complete} free system.  We wrote essential but\n-unexciting major components, such as the assembler and linker, because\n-you can't have a system without them.  A complete system needs more\n-than just programming tools, so we wrote other components as well,\n-such as the Bourne Again SHell, the PostScript interpreter\n-Ghostscript, and the GNU C library.\n-\n-By the early 90s we had put together the whole system aside from the\n-kernel (and we were also working on a kernel, the GNU Hurd, which runs\n-on top of Mach).  Developing this kernel has been a lot harder than we\n-expected, and we are still working on finishing it.\n-\n-Fortunately, you don't have to wait for it, because Linux is working\n-now.  When Linus Torvalds wrote Linux, he filled the last major gap.\n-People could then put Linux together with the GNU system to make a\n-complete free system: a Linux-based GNU system (or GNU/Linux system,\n-for short).\n-\n-Putting them together sounds simple, but it was not a trivial job.\n-The GNU C library (called glibc for short) needed substantial changes.\n-Integrating a complete system as a distribution that would work ``out\n-of the box'' was a big job, too.  It required addressing the issue of\n-how to install and boot the system---a problem we had not tackled,\n-because we hadn't yet reached that point.  The people who developed\n-the various system distributions made a substantial contribution.\n-\n-The GNU Project supports GNU/Linux systems as well as @emph{the}\n-GNU system---even with funds.  We funded the rewriting of the\n-Linux-related extensions to the GNU C library, so that now they are\n-well integrated, and the newest GNU/Linux systems use the current\n-library release with no changes.  We also funded an early stage of the\n-development of Debian GNU/Linux.\n-\n-We use Linux-based GNU systems today for most of our work, and we hope\n-you use them too.  But please don't confuse the public by using the\n-name ``Linux'' ambiguously.  Linux is the kernel, one of the essential\n-major components of the system.  The system as a whole is more or less\n-the GNU system."}]}
