The other is the egcs variant.  As of egcs version 1.1,\n-these variants are kept fairly similar in most respects.  Pertinent\n-differences, such as the layout of the source code, are specified below.\n-\n-Below, `[FSF]' denotes information applicable to only the FSF variant of\n-g77, while `[egcs]' denotes egcs-only information.\n-\n-\n-* IMPORTANT: Things you *must* do (or avoid) are marked with a * at the\n-  beginning of the line in this file!!!\n-\n-\n-The email address to which bugs are to be reported is either\n-[FSF] <fortran@gnu.org> or [egcs] <egcs-bugs@egcs.cygnus.com>.\n-\n-* *DO NOT* send any email (reporting bugs, asking questions, etc.) to\n-  either of these addresses without *first* reading the g77 documentation.\n-  Use `info', Info mode in GNU Emacs, or a text viewer such as `more' to\n-  do this.\n-\n-  The g77 documentation is in the source files named `g77.info',\n-  `g77.info-1', `g77.info-2', and so on in the `f' subdirectory.  If these\n-  files are not present or you can't find them, contact the person or\n-  organization that put together the g77 distribution you are using (probably\n-  not the FSF or egcs), or ask your system administrator for help.\n-\n-\n-This README applies to only the g77-specific portions of the source-code\n-tree that contains it.  These portions include:\n-\n-  -  The README.g77 and [FSF] COPYING.g77 files, in this directory, \"this\n-     directory\" being [FSF] the top-level directory containing a g77\n-     distribution or [egcs] the gcc/ subdirectory of an egcs distribution.\n-\n-  -  The g77 front end, in the f/ subdirectory of this directory.\n-\n-  -  The libg2c library, in [FSF] the f/runtime/ subdirectory of this\n-     directory or [egcs] the libf2c/ directory under the top-level\n-     directory of the egcs distribution.\n-\n-\n-* To build g77, you must have a source distribution of [FSF] gcc\n-  version 2.8 or [egcs] egcs version 1.1.  Do not attempt to use\n-  any other version of gcc or egcs, because this version of g77 is\n-  designed to work with only those versions.\n-\n-  Note that you must have *source* copies of the gcc or egcs distribution!\n-  You cannot build g77 just using binaries of gcc or egcs.  Also, unless\n-  you are an expert, avoid using any distribution of gcc or egcs not\n-  identical to the ones distributed by the FSF and Cygnus Support,\n-  respectively.  The primary FSF distribution site is:\n-\n-    <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/>\n-\n-  The primary egcs distribution site is:\n-\n-    <ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/>\n-\n-  Both of these sites have approved mirror sites from which valid\n-  distributions also may be obtained.\n-\n-* Do not attempt to combine the egcs version of g77 with the FSF\n-  gcc distribution, or the FSF version of g77 with the egcs gcc\n-  distribution.  Although the differences are minor, they might\n-  be sufficient to prevent g77 from building properly, or from\n-  working properly if the build appears to succeed.\n-\n-[FSF] g77 is distributed as g77-<version>/f/ so that unpacking the g77\n-distribution is done in the normal GNU way, resulting in a directory having\n-the version number in the name.  However, to build g77, the g77 distribution\n-must be merged with an appropriate gcc distribution, normally in a gcc\n-source directory, before configuring, building, and installing g77.\n-\n-[FSF] If you have just unpacked the g77 distribution, before proceeding,\n-you must merge the contents of the g77 distribution with the appropriate\n-gcc distribution on your system.\n-\n-* [FSF] Read and follow the instructions in f/INSTALL that\n-  explain how to merge a g77 source directory into a gcc source\n-  directory.  You can use Info to read the same installation\n-  instructions via:\n-\n-    info -f f/g77.info -n Unpacking\n-\n-[FSF] The resulting directory layout includes the following, where gcc/\n-might be a link to, for example, gcc-2.8.1/:\n-\n-    gcc/                    Non-g77 files in gcc\n-    gcc/COPYING.g77         A copy of the GPL, under which g77 is licensed\n-    gcc/README.g77          This file\n-    gcc/f/                  GNU Fortran front end\n-    gcc/f/runtime/          libg2c configuration and g2c.h file generation\n-    gcc/f/runtime/libF77/   Non-I/O portion of libg2c\n-    gcc/f/runtime/libI77/   I/O portion of libg2c\n-    gcc/f/runtime/libU77/   Additional interfaces to libc for libg2c\n-\n-[FSF] Applying g77 patches in the form of .diff files is done by typing\n-`patch -p1 -d gcc' (where gcc/ contains the f/ subdirectory).  That is,\n-g77 patches are distributed in the same form, and at the same directory\n-level, as patches to the gcc distribution.  (Note: make sure you're\n-using GNU patch, version 2.5 or later!  Other versions of patch\n-have trouble with g77-related patches.)\n-\n-[egcs] The egcs version of g77 is distributed already merged with\n-the rest of egcs (such as the gcc back end).\n-\n-[egcs] The resulting directory layout includes the following, where egcs/\n-might be a link to, for example, egcs-1.1/:\n-\n-    egcs/gcc/               Non-g77 files in gcc\n-    egcs/gcc/README.g77     This file\n-    egcs/gcc/f/             GNU Fortran front end\n-    egcs/libf2c/            libg2c configuration and g2c.h file generation\n-    egcs/libf2c/libF77/     Non-I/O portion of libg2c\n-    egcs/libf2c/libI77/     I/O portion of libg2c\n-    egcs/libf2c/libU77/     Additional interfaces to libc for libg2c\n-\n-[egcs] Applying g77-specific patches to egcs is done the same way as\n-applying other egcs patches.\n-\n-\n-Below, `libf2c/' shall denote [FSF] gcc/f/runtime/ or [egcs] egcs/libf2c/,\n-while `f/' shall denote [FSF] the rest of gcc/f/ or [egcs] egcs/gcc/f/.\n-\n-\n-Components of note in g77 are described below.\n-\n-f/ as a whole contains the program GNU Fortran (g77), while libf2c/\n-contains a portion of the separate program f2c.  Note: The libf2c\n-code is not part of the program g77, just distributed with it.\n-\n-f/ contains text files that document the Fortran compiler, source\n-files for the GNU Fortran Front End (FFE), and some other stuff.\n-The g77 compiler code is placed in f/ because it, along with its contents,\n-is designed to be a subdirectory of a GNU CC (gcc) source directory, gcc/,\n-which is structured so that language-specific front ends can be \"dropped\n-in\" as subdirectories.  The C++ front end (g++), is an example of this --\n-it resides in the cp/ subdirectory.  Note that the C front end (also\n-referred to as gcc) is an exception to this, as its source files reside\n-in the gcc/ directory itself.\n-\n-libf2c/ contains the run-time libraries for the f2c program, also used\n-by g77.  These libraries normally referred to collectively as libf2c.\n-When built as part of g77, libf2c is installed under the name libg2c to avoid\n-conflict with any existing version of libf2c, and thus is often referred\n-to as libg2c when the g77 version is specifically being referred to.\n-\n-The netlib version of libf2c/ contains two distinct libraries, libF77 and\n-libI77, each in their own subdirectories.  In g77, this distinction is not\n-made, beyond maintaining the subdirectory structure in the source-code tree.\n-\n-libf2c/ is not part of the program g77, just distributed with it.  It\n-contains files not present in the official (netlib) version of libf2c,\n-and also contains some minor changes made from libf2c, to fix some bugs,\n-and to facilitate automatic configuration, building, and installation of\n-libf2c (as libg2c) for use by g77 users.\n-\n-* See libf2c/README for more information, including licensing conditions\n-  governing distribution of programs containing code from libg2c.\n-\n-libg2c, g77's version of libf2c, adds Dave Love's implementation of\n-libU77, in the libf2c/libU77/ directory.  This library is distributed\n-under the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) -- see the\n-file libf2c/libU77/COPYING.LIB for more information, as this license\n-governs distribution conditions for programs containing code from\n-this portion of the library.\n-\n-\n-Files of note in g77 are described below.\n-\n-f/BUGS lists some important bugs known to be in g77.  Or:\n-\n-  info -f f/g77.info -n \"Actual Bugs\"\n-\n-f/ChangeLog lists recent changes to g77 internals.\n-\n-libf2c/ChangeLog lists recent changes to libg2c internals.\n-\n-[FSF] f/INSTALL describes how to build and install GNU Fortran.  Or:\n-\n-  info -f f/g77.info -n Installation\n-\n-f/NEWS contains the per-release changes.  These include the user-visible\n-changes described under \"Changes\" in the g77 documentation, plus internal\n-changes of import.  Or:\n-\n-  info -f f/g77.info -n News\n-\n-* All users of g77 (not just installers) should read f/g77.info*\n-  as well, using the `more' command if neither the `info' command,\n-  nor GNU Emacs (with its Info mode), are available, or if they\n-  aren't yet accustomed to using these tools.  Read f/BUGS and f/NEWS\n-  plus, if you are planning on building or installing the FSF version\n-  of g77, f/INSTALL, at the very least!  All of these files are\n-  readable as \"plain text\" files.\n-\n-* Also see <ftp://alpha.gnu.org/g77.plan> for up-to-date information\n-  regarding g77 bug reports, known bugs, bug-fixes, and new versions.\n-\n-\n-The rest of this file is of note to only those who wish to\n-debug, modify, or test the FFE (in conjunction with the gcc back end).\n-\n-If you want to explore the FFE code, which lives entirely in f/, here\n-are a few clues.  The file g77spec.c contains the g77-specific source code\n-for the `g77' command only -- this just forms a variant of the `gcc'\n-command, so, just as the `gcc' command itself does not contain\n-the C front end, the `g77' command does not contain the Fortran front\n-end (FFE).  The FFE code ends up in an executable named `f771', which\n-does the actual compiling, so it contains the FFE plus the gcc back end\n-(the latter to do most of the optimization, and the code generation).\n-\n-The file parse.c is the source file for main() for a stand-alone FFE and\n-yyparse() for f771.  (Stand-alone building of the FFE doesn't work these days.)\n-The file top.c contains the top-level FFE function ffe_file and it (along\n-with top.h) define all ffe_[a-z].*, ffe[A-Z].*, and FFE_[A-Za-z].* symbols.\n-The file fini.c is a main() program that is used when building the FFE to\n-generate C header and source files for recognizing keywords.  The files\n-malloc.c and malloc.h comprise a memory manager that defines all\n-malloc_[a-z].*, malloc[A-Z].*, and MALLOC_[A-Za-z].* symbols.  All other\n-modules named <xyz> are comprised of all files named <xyz>*.<ext> and\n-define all ffe<xyz>_[a-z].*, ffe<xyz>[A-Z].*, and FFE<XYZ>_[A-Za-z].* symbols.\n-If you understand all this, congratulations -- it's easier for me to remember\n-how it works than to type in these grep patterns (such as they are).  But it\n-does make it easy to find where a symbol is defined -- for example,\n-the symbol \"ffexyz_set_something\" would be defined in xyz.h and implemented\n-there (if it's a macro) or in xyz.c.\n-\n-The \"porting\" files of note currently are: proj.h, which defines the\n-\"language\" used by all the other source files (the language being\n-Standard C plus some useful things like ARRAY_SIZE and such) -- change\n-this file when you find your system doesn't properly define a Standard C\n-macro or function, for example; target.h and target.c, which describe\n-the target machine in terms of what data types are supported, how they are\n-denoted (what C type does an INTEGER*8 map to, for example), how to convert\n-between them, and so on (though as of 0.5.3, more and more of this information\n-is being dynamically configured by ffecom_init_0); com.h and com.c, which\n-interface to the target back end (currently only FFE stand-alone and the GBE);\n-ste.c, which contains code for implementing recognized executable statements\n-in the target back end (again currently either FFE or GBE); src.h and src.c,\n-which describe information on the format(s) of source files (such as whether\n-they are never to be processed as case-insensitive with regard to Fortran\n-keywords); and proj.c, which contains whatever code is needed to support\n-the language defined by proj.h.\n-\n-If you want to debug the f771 executable, for example if it crashes,\n-note that the global variables \"lineno\" and \"input_filename\" are set\n-to reflect the current line being read by the lexer during the first-pass\n-analysis of a program unit and to reflect the current line being\n-processed during the second-pass compilation of a program unit.  If\n-an invocation of the function ffestd_exec_end() is on the stack,\n-the compiler is in the second pass, otherwise it is in the first.\n-(This information might help you reduce a test case and/or work around\n-a bug in g77 until a fix is available.)\n-\n-Any questions or comments on these topics?
