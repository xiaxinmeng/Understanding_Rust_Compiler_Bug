The\nscope of this block is naturally the enclosing procedure. However, the\nscope field was wrongly set to the entity of the enclosing procedure\nbody (i.e. E_Subprogram_Body); now it is set to the entity of the\nenclosing procedure spec (i.e. E_Procedure).\n\nIn general, the scope field should always points to spec, even for\nentities that are syntactically nested within a program unit body. The\nscope set to E_Subprogram_Body entity was only accepted because in gigi\nwe had a protection for that, but this protection is now removed.\n\nThis patch fixes a regression in a ravenscar testsuite test (c_rf02_06),\nwhere GNAT was crashing when compiling in configurable runtime mode with\nrestriction No_Exception_Propagation.\n\ngcc/ada/\n\n\t* exp_ch9.adb (Build_Protected_Entry): Set scope of the nested\n\tblock to spec and not the body of the procedure created for a\n\tprotected entry.", "tree": {"sha": "abb5e53e3d3edd9b03d5807b6ed88d04c39d9cb5", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/git/trees/abb5e53e3d3edd9b03d5807b6ed88d04c39d9cb5"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/git/commits/bb1c939d9b800ef9aadf8a82cbafdfae5c88210c", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/bb1c939d9b800ef9aadf8a82cbafdfae5c88210c", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commit/bb1c939d9b800ef9aadf8a82cbafdfae5c88210c", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/bb1c939d9b800ef9aadf8a82cbafdfae5c88210c/comments", "author": {"login": "ptroja", "id": 161602, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTYwMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161602?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ptroja", "html_url": "https://github.com/ptroja", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ptroja/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ptroja/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ptroja/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ptroja/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ptroja/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ptroja/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ptroja/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ptroja/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ptroja/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "pmderodat", "id": 758452, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc1ODQ1Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/758452?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat", "html_url": "https://github.com/pmderodat", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmderodat/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "7a60ba4c831a6d5e0d58cdfa64ddcb7c6ac09835", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/7a60ba4c831a6d5e0d58cdfa64ddcb7c6ac09835", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commit/7a60ba4c831a6d5e0d58cdfa64ddcb7c6ac09835"}], "stats": {"total": 3, "additions": 2, "deletions": 1}, "files": [{"sha": "f70678059799d92b0772c2d7b4d9038f578ab9b0", "filename": "gcc/ada/exp_ch9.adb", "status": "modified", "additions": 2, "deletions": 1, "changes": 3, "blob_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/bb1c939d9b800ef9aadf8a82cbafdfae5c88210c/gcc%2Fada%2Fexp_ch9.adb", "raw_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/raw/bb1c939d9b800ef9aadf8a82cbafdfae5c88210c/gcc%2Fada%2Fexp_ch9.adb", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/contents/gcc%2Fada%2Fexp_ch9.adb?ref=bb1c939d9b800ef9aadf8a82cbafdfae5c88210c", "patch": "@@ -3707,7 +3707,8 @@ package body Exp_Ch9 is\n \n       Analyze_Statements (Bod_Stmts);\n \n-      Set_Scope (Entity (Identifier (First (Bod_Stmts))), Bod_Id);\n+      Set_Scope (Entity (Identifier (First (Bod_Stmts))),\n+                 Protected_Body_Subprogram (Ent));\n \n       Reset_Scopes_To\n         (First (Bod_Stmts), Entity (Identifier (First (Bod_Stmts))));"}]}
