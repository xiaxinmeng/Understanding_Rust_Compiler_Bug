Refer\n+to your linker documentation for exact details.  The general\n+description below applies to the GNU linker.  \n+\n+The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library.\n+The directories searched include several standard system directories\n+plus any that you specify with @option{-L}.\n+\n+Static libraries are archives of object files, and have file names\n+like @file{lib@var{library}.a}.  Some targets also support shared\n+libraries, which typically have names like @file{lib@var{library}.so}.\n+If both static and shared libraries are found, the linker gives\n+preference to linking with the shared library unless the\n+@option{-static} option is used.\n+\n It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the\n linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they\n are specified.  Thus, @samp{foo.o -lz bar.o} searches library @samp{z}\n after file @file{foo.o} but before @file{bar.o}.  If @file{bar.o} refers\n to functions in @samp{z}, those functions may not be loaded.\n \n-The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,\n-which is actually a file named @file{lib@var{library}.a}.

The linker handles an archive file by\n-scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far\n-been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an\n-ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only\n-difference between using an @option{-l} option and specifying a file name\n-is that @option{-l} surrounds @var{library} with @samp{lib} and @samp{.a}\n-and searches several directories.\n-\n @item -lobjc\n @opindex lobjc\n You need this special case of the @option{-l} option in order to"}]}
