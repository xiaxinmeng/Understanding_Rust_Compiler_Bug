GCJ can compile Java source or\n-            Java bytecodes to either native code or Java class files, and\n-            supports native methods written in either the standard JNI or\n-            the more efficient and convenient CNI.\n-          + New C++ ABI, capable of inter-operating with other IA-64\n-            compilers.\n-          + The new ABI also significantly reduces the size of symbol and\n-            debug information.\n-          + New C++ support library and many C++ bug fixes, vastly\n-            improving our conformance to the ISO C++ standard.\n-          + New [5]inliner for C++.\n-          + Rewritten C preprocessor, integrated into the C, C++ and\n-            Objective C compilers, with very many improvements including\n-            ISO C99 support and [6]improvements to dependency generation.\n-          + Support for more [7]ISO C99 features.\n-          + Many improvements to support for checking calls to format\n-            functions such as printf and scanf, including support for ISO\n-            C99 format features, extensions from the Single Unix\n-            Specification and GNU libc 2.2, checking of strfmon formats\n-            and features to assist in auditing for format string security\n-            bugs.\n-          + New warnings for C code that may have undefined semantics\n-            because of violations of sequence point rules in the C\n-            standard (such as a = a++;, a[n] = b[n++]; and a[i++] = i;),\n-            included in -Wall.\n-          + Additional warning option -Wfloat-equal.\n-          + Improvements to -Wtraditional.\n-          + Fortran improvements are listed in [8]the Fortran\n-            documentation.\n-     * New Targets and Target Specific Improvements:\n-          + New x86 back-end, generating much improved code.\n-          + Support for a generic i386-elf target contributed.\n-          + New option to emit x86 assembly code using Intel style syntax\n-            (-mintel-syntax).\n-          + HPUX 11 support contributed.\n-          + Improved PowerPC code generation, including scheduled\n-            prologue and epilogue.\n-          + Port of gcc to Intel's IA-64 processor contributed.\n-          + Port of gcc to Motorola's MCore 210 and 340 contributed.\n-          + New unified back-end for Arm, Thumb and StrongArm\n-            contributed.\n-          + Port of gcc to Intel's XScale processor contributed.\n-          + Port of gcc to Atmel's AVR microcontrollers contributed.\n-          + Port of gcc to Mitsubishi's D30V processor contributed.\n-          + Port of gcc to Matsushita's AM33 processor (a member of the\n-            MN10300 processor family) contributed.\n-          + Port of gcc to Fujitsu's FR30 processor contributed.\n-          + Port of gcc to Motorola's 68HC11 and 68HC12 processors\n-            contributed.\n-          + Port of gcc to Sun's picoJava processor core contributed.\n-     * Documentation improvements:\n-          + Substantially rewritten and improved C preprocessor manual.\n-          + Many improvements to other documentation.\n-          + Manpages for gcc, cpp and gcov are now generated\n-            automatically from the master Texinfo manual, eliminating the\n-            problem of manpages being out of date. (The generated\n-            manpages are only extracts from the full manual, which is\n-            provided in Texinfo form, from which info, HTML, other\n-            formats and a printed manual can be generated.)\n-          + Generated info files are included in the release tarballs\n-            alongside their Texinfo sources, avoiding problems on some\n-            platforms with building makeinfo as part of the GCC\n-            distribution.\n-     * Other significant improvements:\n-          + Garbage collection used internally by the compiler for most\n-            memory allocation instead of obstacks.\n-          + Lengauer and Tarjan algorithm used for computing dominators\n-            in the CFG.

Programs that now generate a warning\n-       about this may be fixed by adding a null statement (a single\n-       semicolon) after the label.\n-     * The poorly documented extension that allowed string constants in\n-       C, C++ and Objective C to contain unescaped newlines has been\n-       deprecated and may be removed in a future version. Programs using\n-       this extension may be fixed in several ways: the bare newline may\n-       be replaced by \\n, or preceded by \\n\\, or string concatenation may\n-       be used with the bare newline preceded by \\n\" and \" placed at the\n-       start of the next line.\n-     * The Chill compiler is not included in GCC 3.0, because of the lack\n-       of a volunteer to convert it to use garbage collection.\n-     _________________________________________________________________\n-\n-\n-    Please send FSF & GNU inquiries & questions to [1]gnu@gnu.org.

GCC used to stand for the GNU C\n-   Compiler, but since the compiler supports several other languages\n-   aside from C, it now stands for the GNU Compiler Collection.\n-\n-   This is a minor release to address several bugs in the GCC version\n-   2.95.1 release.\n-\n-   The -fstrict-aliasing is not enabled by default for GCC 2.95.2. While\n-   the optimizations performed by -fstrict-aliasing are valid according\n-   to the C and C++ standards, the optimization have caused some\n-   problems, particularly with old non-conforming code.\n-\n-   The GCC developers are experimenting with ways to warn users about\n-   code which violates the C/C++ standards, but those warnings are not\n-   ready for widespread use at this time. Rather than wait for those\n-   warnings the GCC developers have chosen to disable -fstrict-aliasing\n-   by default for the GCC 2.95.2 release.\n-\n-   We strongly encourage developers to find and fix code which violates\n-   the C/C++ standards as -fstrict-aliasing may be enabled by default in\n-   future releases. Use the option -fstrict-aliasing to re-enable these\n-   optimizations.\n-\n-     * Generic bugfixes and improvements\n-          + Fix incorrectly optimized memory reference in global common\n-            subexpression elimination (GCSE) optimization pass.\n-          + Fix code generation bug in regmove.c in which it could\n-            incorrectly change a \"const\" value.\n-          + Fix bug in optimization of conditionals involving volatile\n-            memory references.\n-          + Avoid over-allocation of stack space for some procedures.\n-          + Fixed bug in the compiler which caused incorrect optimization\n-            of an obscure series of bit manipulations, shifts and\n-            arithmetic.\n-          + Fixed register allocator bug which caused teTeX to be\n-            mis-compiled on Sparc targets.\n-          + Avoid incorrect optimization of degenerate case statements\n-            for certain targets such as the ARM.\n-          + Fix out of range memory reference in the jump optimizer.\n-          + Avoid dereferencing null pointer in fix-header.\n-          + Fix test for GCC specific features so that it is possible to\n-            bootstrap with gcc-2.6.2 and older versions of GCC.\n-          + Fix typo in scheduler which could potentially cause out of\n-            range memory accesses.\n-          + Avoid incorrect loop reversal which caused incorrect code for\n-            certain loops on PowerPC targets.\n-          + Avoid incorrect optimization of switch statements on certain\n-            targets (for example the ARM).\n-     * Platform specific bugfixes and improvements\n-          + Work around bug in Sun V5.0 compilers which caused bootstrap\n-            comparison failures on Sparc targets.\n-          + Fix Sparc backend bug which caused aborts in final.c.\n-          + Fix sparc-hal-solaris2* configuration fragments.\n-          + Fix bug in sparc block profiling.\n-          + Fix obscure code generation bug for the PARISC targets.\n-          + Define __STDC_EXT__ for HPUX configurations.\n-          + Various POWERPC64 code generation bugfixes.\n-          + Fix abort for PPC targets using ELF (ex GNU/Linux).\n-          + Fix collect2 problems for AIX targets.\n-          + Correct handling of .file directive for PPC targets.\n-          + Fix bug in fix_trunc x86 patterns.\n-          + Fix x86 port to correctly pop the FP stack for functions that\n-            return structures in memory.\n-          + Fix minor bug in strlen x86 pattern.\n-          + Use stabs debugging instead of dwarf1 for x86-solaris\n-            targets.\n-          + Fix template repository code to handle leading underscore in\n-            mangled names.\n-          + Fix weak/weak alias support for OpenBSD.\n-          + GNU/Linux for the ARM has C++ compatible include files.\n-     * Language & Runtime specific fixes.\n-          + Fix handling of constructor attribute in the C front-end\n-            which caused problems building the Chill runtime library on\n-            some targets.\n-          + Fix minor problem merging type qualifiers in the C front-end.\n-          + Fix aliasing bug for pointers and references (C/C++).\n-          + Fix incorrect \"non-constant initializer bug\" when\n-            -traditional or -fwritable-strings is enabled.\n-          + Fix build error for Chill front-end on SunOS.\n-          + Do not complain about duplicate instantiations when using\n-            -frepo (C++)\n-          + Fix array bounds handling in C++ front-end which caused\n-            problems with dwarf debugging information in some\n-            circumstances.\n-          + Fix minor namespace problem.\n-          + Fix problem linking java programs.\n-\n-   The whole suite has been extensively [1]regression tested and\n-   [2]package tested.

This\n-       is particularly noticeable when compiling older versions of the\n-       Linux kernel (2.0.xx). Please refer to the [1]FAQ for more\n-       information on this issue.\n-     * GCC 2.95 implements type based alias analysis to disambiguate\n-       memory references. Some programs, particularly the Linux kernel\n-       violate ANSI/ISO aliasing rules and therefore may not operate\n-       correctly when compiled with GCC 2.95. Please refer to the [2]FAQ\n-       for more information on this issue.\n-     * GCC 2.95 has a known bug in its handling of complex variables for\n-       64bit targets. Instead of silently generating incorrect code, GCC\n-       2.95 will issue a fatal error for situations it can not handle.\n-       This primarily affects the Fortran community as Fortran makes more\n-       use of complex variables than C or C++.\n-     * GCC 2.95 has an integrated libstdc++, but does not have an\n-       integrated libg++. Furthermore old libg++ releases will not work\n-       with GCC 2.95. You can retrieve a recent copy of libg++ from the\n-       [3]GCC ftp server.\n-       Note most C++ programs only need libstdc++.\n-     * Exception handling may not work with shared libraries,\n-       particularly on alphas, hppas, rs6000/powerpc and mips based\n-       platforms. Exception handling is known to work on x86 GNU/Linux\n-       platforms with shared libraries.\n-     * In general, GCC 2.95 is more rigorous about rejecting invalid C++\n-       code or deprecated C++ constructs than G++ 2.7, G++ 2.8, EGCS 1.0,\n-       or EGCS 1.1. As a result it may be necessary to fix C++ code\n-       before it will compile with GCC 2.95.\n-     * G++ is also converting toward the ISO C++ standard; as a result\n-       code which was previously valid (and thus accepted by other\n-       compilers and older versions of g++) may no longer be accepted.\n-       The flag -fpermissive may allow some non-conforming code to\n-       compile with GCC 2.95.\n-     * GCC 2.95 compiled C++ code is not binary compatible with EGCS\n-       1.1.x, EGCS 1.0.x or GCC 2.8.x.\n-     * GCC 2.95 does not have changes from the GCC 2.8 tree that were\n-       made between Sept 30, 1998 and April 30, 1999 (the official end of\n-       the GCC 2.8 project). Future GCC releases will include all the\n-       changes from the defunct GCC 2.8 sources.\n-     _________________________________________________________________\n-\n-\n-    Please send FSF & GNU inquiries & questions to [4]gnu@gnu.org.

15, 1999\n-\n-   We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.1.2.\n-\n-   EGCS is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers\n-   using an open development model to accelerate development and testing\n-   of GNU compilers and runtime libraries.\n-\n-   EGCS 1.1.2 is a minor update to the EGCS 1.1.1 compiler to fix several\n-   serious problems in EGCS 1.1.1.\n-     *

Fix incorrect code generation due to mis-handling of\n-            clobbered values in CSE.\n-          + Fix compiler abort/segfault due to incorrect register\n-            splitting when unrolling loops.\n-          + Fix code generation involving autoincremented addresses with\n-            ternary operators.\n-          + Work around bug in the scheduler which caused qt to be\n-            mis-compiled on some platforms.\n-          + Fix code generation problems with -fshort-enums.\n-          + Tighten security for temporary files.\n-          + Improve compile time for codes which make heavy use of\n-            overloaded functions.\n-          + Fix multiply defined constructor/destructor symbol problems.\n-          + Avoid setting bogus RPATH environemnt variable during\n-            bootstrap.\n-          + Avoid GNU-make dependencies in the texinfo subdir.\n-          + Install CPP wrapper script in $(prefix)/bin if --enable-cpp.\n-            --enable-cpp= can be used to specify an additional install\n-            directory for the cpp wrapper script.\n-          + Fix CSE bug which caused incorrect label-label refs to appear\n-            on some platforms.\n-          + Avoid linking in EH routines from libgcc if they are not\n-            needed.\n-          + Avoid obscure bug in aliasing code.\n-          + Fix bug in weak symbol handling.\n-     * Platform-specific improvements and fixes\n-          + Fix detection of PPro/PII on Unixware 7.\n-          + Fix compiler segfault when building spec99 and other programs\n-            for SPARC targets.\n-          + Fix code-generation bugs for integer and floating point\n-            conditional move instructions on the PPro/PII.\n-          + Use fixincludes to fix byteorder problems on

Digital UNIX 4.0B.\n-          + Fix problems with ctors/dtors in SCO shared libraries.\n-          + Abort instead of generating incorrect code for PPro/PII\n-            floating point conditional moves.\n-          + Avoid multiply defined symbols on Linux/GNU systems using\n-            libc-5.4.xx.\n-          + Fix abort in alpha compiler.\n-\n-     Fortran-specific fixes\n-     * Fix the IDate intrinsic (VXT) (in libg2c) so the returned year is\n-       in the documented, non-Y2K-compliant range of 0-99, instead of\n-       being returned as 100 in the year 2000.\n-     * Fix the `Date_and_Time' intrinsic (in libg2c) to return the\n-       milliseconds value properly in Values(8).\n-     * Fix the `LStat' intrinsic (in libg2c) to return device-ID\n-       information properly in SArray(7).\n-\n-   An important goal of EGCS is to allow wide scale testing of new\n-   features and optimizations which are still under development. However,\n-   EGCS has been carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to\n-   most gcc releases.\n-\n-   EGCS 1.1.2 is based on the June 6, 1998 snapshot of the GCC 2.8\n-   development sources; it contains all of the new features found in GCC\n-   2.8.1 as well as all new development from gcc2 up to June 6, 1998.\n-\n-   See the [1]new features page for a more complete list of new features\n-   found in EGCS 1.1 releases.\n-\n-   The EGCS 1.1.2 release includes installation instructions in both HTML\n-   and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel\n-   directory of the EGCS 1.1.2 distribution).

By providing more accurate information\n-       to the priority based allocator, we get better register\n-       allocation.\n-     * The register reloading phase of the compiler optimizes spill code\n-       much better than in previous releases.\n-     * Some bad interactions between the register allocator and\n-       instruction scheduler have been fixed, resulting in much better\n-       code for certain programs. Additionally, we have tuned the\n-       scheduler in various ways to improve performance of generated code\n-       for some architectures.\n-     * The compiler's branch shortening algorithms have been\n-       significantly improved to work better on targets which align jump\n-       targets.\n-     * The compiler now supports -Os to prefer optimizing for code space\n-       over optimizing for code speed.\n-     * The compiler will now totally eliminate library calls which\n-       compute constant values. This primarily helps targets with no\n-       integer div/mul support and targets without floating point\n-       support.\n-     * The compiler now supports an extensive \"--help\" option.\n-     * cpplib has been greatly improved and may be suitable for limited\n-       use.\n-     * Memory footprint for the compiler has been significantly reduced\n-       for some pathological cases.\n-     * The time to build EGCS has been improved for certain targets\n-       (particularly the alpha and mips platforms).\n-     * Many infrastructure improvements throughout the compiler, plus the\n-       usual mountain of bugfixes and minor improvements.\n-     * Target dependent improvements:\n-          + SPARC port now includes V8 plus and V9 support as well as\n-            performance tuning for Ultra class machines. The SPARC port\n-            now uses the Haifa scheduler.\n-          + Alpha port has been tuned for the EV6 processor and has an\n-            optimized expansion of memcpy/bzero. The Alpha port now uses\n-            the Haifa scheduler.\n-          + RS6000/PowerPC: EGCS 1.1 includes support for the Power64\n-            architecture and aix4.3 support. The RS6000/PowerPC port now\n-            uses the Haifa scheduler.\n-          + x86: Alignment of static store data and jump targets is per\n-            Intel recommendations now. Various improvements throughout\n-            the x86 port to improve performance on Pentium processors.\n-            Conditional move support has been fixed and enabled for PPro\n-            processors. The x86 port also better supports 64bit\n-            operations now.\n-          + MIPS has improved multiply/multiply-add support and now\n-            includes mips16 ISA support.\n-          + M68k has many micro-optimizations and Coldfire fixes.\n-     * Core compiler is based on the GCC development tree from June 9,\n-       1998, so we have all of the [5]features found in GCC 2.8.\n-\n-   [6]Return to the EGCS home page\n-\n-   Last modified: September 4, 1999\n-\n-References\n-\n-   1. http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/g77_news.html\n-   2. http://gcc.gnu.org/egcs-1.1/c++features.html\n-   3. http://gcc.gnu.org/news/gcse.html\n-   4. http://gcc.gnu.org/news/alias.html\n-   5. http://gcc.gnu.org/egcs-1.0/features-2.8.html\n-   6. http://gcc.gnu.org/index.html\n-======================================================================\n-http://gcc.gnu.org/egcs-1.1/caveats.html\n-\n-                              EGCS 1.1 Caveats\n-\n-     * EGCS has an integrated libstdc++, but does not have an integrated\n-       libg++. Furthermore old libg++ releases will not work with EGCS;\n-       HJ Lu has made a [1]libg++ snapshot available which may work with\n-       EGCS.\n-       Note most C++ programs only need libstdc++.\n-     * Exception handling may not work with shared libraries,\n-       particularly on alphas, hppas, rs6000/powerpc and mips based\n-       platforms. Exception handling is known to work on x86-linux\n-       platforms with shared libraries.\n-     * Some versions of the Linux kernel have bugs which prevent them\n-       from being compiled or from running when compiled by EGCS. See\n-       [2]the FAQ for additional information.\n-     * In general, EGCS is more rigorous about rejecting invalid C++ code\n-       or deprecated C++ constructs than g++-2.7, g++-2.8 or EGCS 1.0. As\n-       a result it may be necessary to fix C++ code before it will\n-       compile with EGCS.\n-     * G++ is also converting toward the ISO C++ standard; as a result\n-       code which was previously valid (and thus accepted by other\n-       compilers and older versions of g++) may no longer be accepted.\n-     * EGCS 1.1 compiled C++ code is not binary compatible with EGCS\n-       1.0.x or GCC 2.8.x due to changes necessary to support thread safe\n-       exception handling.\n-\n-   [3]Return to the GCC home page\n-\n-   Last modified: July 28, 1999\n-\n-References\n-\n-   1. ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/private/hjl/libg++-2.8.1.2.tar.gz\n-   2. http://gcc.gnu.org/fom_serv/cache/24.html\n-   3. http://gcc.gnu.org/index.html\n-======================================================================\n-http://gcc.gnu.org/egcs-1.0/egcs-1.0.3.html\n-\n-                                 EGCS 1.0.3\n-\n-   May 15, 1998\n-\n-   We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.0.3.\n-\n-   EGCS is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers\n-   using an open development model to accelerate development and testing\n-   of GNU compilers and runtime libraries.\n-\n-   EGCS 1.0.3 is a minor update to the EGCS 1.0.2 compiler to fix a few\n-   problems reported by Red Hat for builds of Red Hat 5.1.\n-     * Generic bugfixes:\n-          + Fix a typo in the libio library which resulted in incorrect\n-            behavior of istream::get.\n-          + Fix the Fortran negative array index problem.\n-          + Fix a major problem with the ObjC runtime thread support\n-            exposed by glibc2.\n-          + Reduce memory consumption of the Haifa scheduler.\n-     * Target specific bugfixes:\n-          + Fix one x86 floating point code generation bug exposed by\n-            glibc2 builds.\n-          + Fix one x86 internal compiler error exposed by glibc2 builds.\n-          + Fix profiling bugs on the Alpha.\n-          + Fix ImageMagick & emacs 20.2 build problems on the Alpha.\n-          + Fix rs6000/ppc bug when converting values from integer types\n-            to floating point types.\n-\n-   An important goal of EGCS is to allow wide scale testing of new\n-   features and optimizations which are still under development.

Changes since the\n-   EGCS 1.0 release:\n-     * Add support for Red Hat 5.0 Linux and better support for Linux\n-       systems using glibc2.\n-       Many programs failed to link when compiled with EGCS 1.0 on Red\n-       Hat 5.0 or on systems with newer versions of glibc2. EGCS 1.0.1\n-       should fix these problems.\n-     * Compatability with both EGCS 1.0 and GCC 2.8 libgcc exception\n-       handling interfaces.\n-       To avoid future compatibility problems, we strongly urge anyone\n-       who is planning on distributing shared libraries that contain C++\n-       code to upgrade to EGCS 1.0.1 first.\n-       Soon after EGCS 1.0 was released, the GCC developers made some\n-       incompatible changes in libgcc's exception handling interfaces.\n-       These changes were needed to solve problems on some platforms.\n-       This means that GCC 2.8.0, when released, will not be seamlessly\n-       compatible with shared libraries built by EGCS 1.0. The reason is\n-       that the libgcc.a in GCC 2.8.0 will not contain a function needed\n-       by the old interface.\n-       The result of this is that there may be compatibility problems\n-       with shared libraries built by EGCS 1.0 when used with GCC 2.8.0.\n-       With EGCS 1.0.1, generated code uses the new (GCC 2.8.0)\n-       interface, and libgcc.a has the support routines for both the old\n-       and the new interfaces (so EGCS 1.0.1 and EGCS 1.0 code can be\n-       freely mixed, and EGCS 1.0.1 and GCC 2.8.0 code can be freely\n-       mixed).\n-       The maintainers of GCC 2.x have decided against including seamless\n-       support for the old interface in 2.8.0, since it was never\n-       \"official\", so to avoid future compatibility problems we recommend\n-       against distributing any shared libraries built by EGCS 1.0 that\n-       contain C++ code (upgrade to 1.0.1 and use that).\n-     * Various bugfixes in the x86, hppa, mips, and rs6000/ppc backends.\n-       The x86 changes fix code generation errors exposed when building\n-       glibc2 and the Linux dynamic linker (ld.so).\n-       The hppa change fixes a compiler abort when configured for use\n-       with RTEMS.\n-       The MIPS changes fix problems with the definition of LONG_MAX on\n-       newer systems, allow for command line selection of the target ABI,\n-       and fix one code generation problem.\n-       The rs6000/ppc change fixes some problems with passing structures\n-       to varargs/stdarg functions.\n-     * A few machine independent bugfixes, mostly to fix code generation\n-       errors when building Linux kernels or glibc.\n-     * Fix a few critical exception handling and template bugs in the C++\n-       compiler.\n-     * Fix Fortran namelist bug on alphas.\n-     * Fix build problems on x86-solaris systems.\n-\n-   An important goal of EGCS is to allow wide scale testing of new\n-   features and optimizations which are still under development. However,\n-   EGCS has been carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to\n-   most GCC releases.\n-\n-   EGCS 1.0.1 is based on an August 2, 1997 snapshot of the GCC 2.8\n-   development sources; it contains nearly all of the new features found\n-   in GCC 2.8.\n-\n-   EGCS also contains many improvements and features not found in GCC 2.7\n-   and even the soon to be released GCC 2.8 compilers.\n-     * Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major\n-       linux systems!\n-     * The integrated libstdc++ library includes a verbatim copy of\n-       [1]SGI's STL release.\n-     * Integrated GNU Fortran compiler\n-     * New instruction scheduler\n-     * New alias analysis code\n-\n-   See the [2]new features page for a more complete list of new features\n-   found in EGCS 1.0.x releases.\n-\n-   The EGCS 1.0.1 release includes installation instructions in both HTML\n-   and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel\n-   directory of the EGCS 1.0.1 distribution). However, we also keep the\n-   most up to date [3]installation instructions and [4]build/test status\n-   on our web page. We will update those pages as new information becomes\n-   available.\n-\n-   And, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some [5]caveats to\n-   using EGCS.\n-\n-   Update: Big thanks to Stanford for providing a high speed link for\n-   downloading EGCS (go.cygnus.com)!\n-\n-   [6]Download EGCS 1.0.1 from ftp.cygnus.com (USA California)\n-\n-   [7]Download EGCS 1.0.1 from go.cygnus.com (USA California -- High\n-   speed link provided by Stanford)\n-\n-   The EGCS 1.0.1 release is also available on many mirror sites.\n-   [8]Goto mirror list to find a closer site\n-\n-   We'd like to thank the numerous people that have contributed new\n-   features, test results, bugfixes, etc. Unfortunately, they're far too\n-   numerous to mention by name.\n-     _________________________________________________________________\n-\n-   Last modified on July 28, 1999.\n-\n-References\n-\n-   1. http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL/\n-   2. http://gcc.gnu.org/egcs-1.0/features.html\n-   3. http://gcc.gnu.org/install/index.html\n-   4. http://gcc.gnu.org/egcs-1.0/buildstat.html\n-   5. http://gcc.gnu.org/egcs-1.0/caveats.html\n-   6. ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/releases/index.html\n-   7. ftp://go.cygnus.com/pub/sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/releases/index.html\n-   8. http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html\n-======================================================================\n-http://gcc.gnu.org/egcs-1.0/egcs-1.0.html\n-\n-                                  EGCS 1.0\n-\n-   December 3, 1997\n-\n-   We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.0.\n-\n-   EGCS is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers\n-   using an open development model to accelerate development and testing\n-   of GNU compilers and runtime libraries.\n-\n-   An important goal of EGCS is to allow wide scale testing of\n-   experimental features and optimizations; therefore, EGCS contains some\n-   features and optimizations which are still under development.

Furthermore old libg++ releases will not work with egc; HJ\n-       Lu has made a [1]libg++ snapshot available which may work with\n-       EGCS.\n-       Note most C++ programs only need libstdc++.\n-     * Note that using -pedantic or -Wreturn-type can cause an explosion\n-       in the amount of memory needed for template-heavy C++ code, such\n-       as code that uses STL. Also note that -Wall includes\n-       -Wreturn-type, so if you use -Wall you will need to specify\n-       -Wno-return-type to turn it off.\n-     * Exception handling may not work with shared libraries,\n-       particularly on alphas, hppas, and mips based platforms. Exception\n-       handling is known to work on x86-linux platforms with shared\n-       libraries.\n-     * Some versions of the Linux kernel have bugs which prevent them\n-       from being compiled or from running when compiled by EGCS. See\n-       [2]the FAQ for additional information.\n-     * In general, EGCS is more rigorous about rejecting invalid C++ code\n-       or deprecated C++ constructs than G++ 2.7. As a result it may be\n-       necessary to fix C++ code before it will compile with EGCS.\n-     * G++ is also aggressively tracking the C++ standard; as a result\n-       code which was previously valid (and thus accepted by other\n-       compilers and older versions of G++) may no longer be accepted.\n-     * EGCS 1.0 may not work with Red Hat Linux 5.0 on all targets. EGCS\n-       1.0.x and later releases should work with Red Hat Linux 5.0.\n-\n-   [3]Return to the GCC home page\n-\n-   Last modified: August 27, 1998\n-\n-References\n-\n-   1. ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/private/hjl/libg++-2.8.1.2.tar.gz\n-   2. http://gcc.gnu.org/fom_serv/cache/24.html\n-   3. http://gcc.gnu.org/index.html\n-======================================================================"}]}
