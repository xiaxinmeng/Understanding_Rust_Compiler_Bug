PREAMBLE\n+\n+The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\n+written document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone\n+the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without\n+modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,\n+this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get\n+credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for\n+modifications made by others.\n+\n+This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative\n+works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\n+complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\n+license designed for free software.\n+\n+We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\n+software, because free software needs free documentation: a free\n+program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\n+software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\n+it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\n+whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\n+principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n+\n+\n+1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n+\n+This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a\n+notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed\n+under the terms of this License.  The \"Document\", below, refers to any\n+such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is\n+addressed as \"you\".\n+\n+A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the\n+Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\n+modifications and/or translated into another language.\n+\n+A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\n+the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\n+publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject\n+(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly\n+within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a\n+textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any\n+mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\n+connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\n+commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\n+them.\n+\n+The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\n+are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\n+that says that the Document is released under this License.\n+\n+The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed,\n+as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\n+the Document is released under this License.\n+\n+A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\n+represented in a format whose specification is available to the\n+general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and\n+straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\n+pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\n+drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\n+for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\n+to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\n+format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage\n+subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is\n+not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\n+\n+Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\n+ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\n+or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\n+HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include\n+PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only\n+by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or\n+processing tools are not generally available, and the\n+machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output\n+purposes only.\n+\n+The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\n+plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\n+this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\n+formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means\n+the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\n+preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\n+\n+\n+2. VERBATIM COPYING\n+\n+You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\n+commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\n+copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\n+to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other\n+conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\n+technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\n+copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\n+compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\n+number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\n+\n+You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\n+you may publicly display copies.\n+\n+\n+3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\n+\n+If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,\n+and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose\n+the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\n+Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\n+the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\n+you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\n+the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\n+visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\n+Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\n+the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\n+as verbatim copying in other respects.\n+\n+If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\n+legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\n+reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\n+pages.\n+\n+If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\n+more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\n+copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\n+a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete\n+Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the\n+general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no\n+charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter\n+option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\n+distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this\n+Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location\n+until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque\n+copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to\n+the public.\n+\n+It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\n+Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give\n+them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n+\n+\n+4. MODIFICATIONS\n+\n+You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\n+the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\n+the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\n+Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\n+and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\n+of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n+\n+A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\n+   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\n+   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\n+   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\n+   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n+B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\n+   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\n+   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\n+   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).\n+C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\n+   Modified Version, as the publisher.\n+D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n+E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\n+   adjacent to the other copyright notices.\n+F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\n+   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\n+   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\n+G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\n+   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\n+H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n+I. Preserve the section entitled \"History\", and its title, and add to\n+   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\n+   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\n+   there is no section entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one\n+   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\n+   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\n+   Version as stated in the previous sentence.\n+J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\n+   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\n+   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions\n+   it was based on.  These may be placed in the \"History\" section.\n+   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at\n+   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original\n+   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\n+K. In any section entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\",\n+   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the\n+   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\n+   and/or dedications given therein.\n+L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\n+   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\n+   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\n+M. Delete any section entitled \"Endorsements\".  Such a section\n+   may not be included in the Modified Version.\n+N. Do not retitle any existing section as \"Endorsements\"\n+   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\n+\n+If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\n+appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\n+copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\n+of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\n+list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\n+These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\n+\n+You may add a section entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains\n+nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\n+parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\n+been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\n+standard.\n+\n+You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\n+passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\n+of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\n+Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\n+through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\n+includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\n+by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\n+you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\n+permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\n+\n+The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\n+give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\n+imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n+\n+\n+5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\n+\n+You may combine the Document with other documents released under this\n+License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\n+versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\n+Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\n+list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\n+license notice.\n+\n+The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\n+multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\n+copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\n+different contents, make the title of each such section unique by\n+adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\n+author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\n+Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\n+Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\n+\n+In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled \"History\"\n+in the various original documents, forming one section entitled\n+\"History\"; likewise combine any sections entitled \"Acknowledgements\",\n+and any sections entitled \"Dedications\".  You must delete all sections\n+entitled \"Endorsements.\"\n+\n+\n+6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\n+\n+You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents\n+released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this\n+License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in\n+the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for\n+verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\n+\n+You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute\n+it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this\n+License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all\n+other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n+\n+\n+7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\n+\n+A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\n+and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\n+distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version\n+of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the\n+compilation.  Such a compilation is called an \"aggregate\", and this\n+License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled\n+with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they\n+are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\n+\n+If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\n+copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter\n+of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\n+covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.\n+Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.\n+\n+\n+8. TRANSLATION\n+\n+Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\n+distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\n+Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\n+permission from their copyright holders, but you may include\n+translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\n+original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\n+translation of this License provided that you also include the\n+original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement\n+between the translation and the original English version of this\n+License, the original English version will prevail.\n+\n+\n+9. TERMINATION\n+\n+You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except\n+as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to\n+copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will\n+automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,\n+parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this\n+License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n+parties remain in full compliance.\n+\n+\n+10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\n+\n+The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions\n+of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new\n+versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n+differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

But there's no way to make that work with C++, where\n+     much of the library consists of inline functions and templates, which\n+     are expanded inside the code that uses the library.  So to allow people\n+     to replace the library code, someone using the library would have to\n+     distribute their own source, rendering the LGPL equivalent to the GPL.\n+</p>\n+\n+<p><strong>Q:  I see.  So, what restrictions <em>are</em> there on\n+   programs that use the library?</strong>\n+ <br>A:  None.  We encourage such programs to be released as open source,\n+     but we won't punish you or sue you if you choose otherwise.\n+</p>\n+\n+<!-- Someone would probably shoot me if I uncommented this.\n+<p><strong>Q:  I heard that the startup code for libstdc++-v3 detects\n+   what license the program uses, and makes my program crash if it isn't\n+   an open source license!
