Note that the new operand combinations for\n-parallel instructions, included in newer silicon revisions, are not\n-yet supported.  These should be trivial to add for someone with the\n-newer chips and the inclination.\n-\n-\n-While the generated assembly code is fairly similar to that recognised\n-by the TI assembler, there are a few differences (currently the machine\n-option -mti, designed to enfore compatibility, is not fully\n-implemented).  The major difference is the use of the ^ operator to\n-load the 16 MSBs of an address or constant for the C4x.\n-\n-\n-The generated assembly code requires the GNU assembler (GAS).  This is\n-not currently included as part of the binutils package, due to the\n-many hacks required to be compatible with TI's kludged COFF\n-implementation, and the binutils not being designed for 32-bit bytes.\n-Patches against binutils-2.7.2 can be obtained from\n-http://www.elec.canterbury.ac.nz/c4x.  This site also has patches for\n-the GNU debugger (GDB), incoporating a cycle accurate simulator that\n-can display profiles and histories of code execution, detailing\n-pipeline conflicts etc.\n-\n-\n-GCC can be configured as a cross compiler for both the C3x and C4x\n-architectures on the same system.  Use `configure --target=c4x' to\n-configure GCC for both the C3x and C4x.  Then use the -m30 option to\n-generate code for the C30 or -m40 (the default) for the C40.\n-\n-\n-Further installation notes and other optimization patches for the C4x\n-target can also be obtained from http://www.elec.canterbury.ac.nz/c4x.\n-\n-\n-A Majordomo mailing list, gcc_c40@atlantek.com.au, exists to discuss\n-related issues and suggestions for further optimizations.  To\n-subscribe send a message with `subscribe gcc_c40' in the body to\n-majordomo@atlantek.com.au.\n-\n-\n-Michael Hayes,  26 Nov 98"}]}
