A single CPU\n+         design may suffer multiple ABIs designed by different development\n+         tool vendors who made different choices, or even by the same vendor\n+         for different target applications or compiler versions.  In ideal\n+         circumstances the CPU designer presents one ABI and all the OSes and\n+         compilers use it.  In practice every ABI omits details that compiler\n+         implementers (consciously or accidentally) must choose for themselves.\n+      </p>\n+      <p>That ABI definition suffices for compilers to generate code so a\n+         program can interact safely with an OS and its lowest-level libraries.\n+         Users usually want an ABI to encompass more detail, allowing libraries\n+         built with different compilers (or different releases of the same\n+         compiler!) to be linked together.  For C++, this includes many more\n+         details than for C, and CPU designers (for good reasons elaborated\n+         below) have not stepped up to publish C++ ABIs.  The details include\n+         virtual function implementation, struct inheritance layout, name\n+         mangling, and exception handling.  Such an ABI has been defined for\n+         GNU C++, and is immediately useful for embedded work relying only on\n+         a &quot;free-standing implementation&quot; that doesn't include (much\n+         of) the standard library.  It is a good basis for the work to come.\n+      </p>\n+      <p>A useful C++ ABI must also incorporate many details of the standard \n+         library implementation.  For a C ABI, the layouts of a few structs\n+         (such as FILE, stat, jmpbuf, and the like) and a few macros suffice.\n+         For C++, the details include the complete set of names of functions\n+         and types used, the offsets of class members and virtual functions,\n+         and the actual definitions of all inlines.  C++ exposes many more\n+         library details to the caller than C does.  It makes defining\n+         a complete ABI a much bigger undertaking, and requires not just\n+         documenting library implementation details, but carefully designing\n+         those details so that future bug fixes and optimizations don't\n+         force breaking the ABI.\n+      </p>\n+      <p>There are ways to help isolate library implementation details from the \n+         ABI, but they trade off against speed.  Library details used in\n+         inner loops (e.g., getchar) must be exposed and frozen for all\n+         time, but many others may reasonably be kept hidden from user code,\n+         so they may later be changed.  Deciding which, and implementing\n+         the decisions, must happen before you can reasonably document a\n+         candidate C++ ABI that encompasses the standard library.\n+      </p>\n+\n <!-- ####################################################### -->\n \n <hr>"}, {"sha": "4f687cd86e73c6dc7af60219a1284395920e7a39", "filename": "libstdc++-v3/docs/html/faq/index.txt", "status": "modified", "additions": 142, "deletions": 93, "changes": 235, "blob_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/2dac8f87e8589752899953928836d2fd4fd99111/libstdc%2B%2B-v3%2Fdocs%2Fhtml%2Ffaq%2Findex.txt", "raw_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/raw/2dac8f87e8589752899953928836d2fd4fd99111/libstdc%2B%2B-v3%2Fdocs%2Fhtml%2Ffaq%2Findex.txt", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/contents/libstdc%2B%2B-v3%2Fdocs%2Fhtml%2Ffaq%2Findex.txt?ref=2dac8f87e8589752899953928836d2fd4fd99111", "patch": "@@ -52,6 +52,7 @@\n          5.

A single CPU design may suffer multiple ABIs\n+   designed by different development tool vendors who made different\n+   choices, or even by the same vendor for different target applications\n+   or compiler versions. In ideal circumstances the CPU designer presents\n+   one ABI and all the OSes and compilers use it. In practice every ABI\n+   omits details that compiler implementers (consciously or accidentally)\n+   must choose for themselves.\n+\n+   That ABI definition suffices for compilers to generate code so a\n+   program can interact safely with an OS and its lowest-level libraries.\n+   Users usually want an ABI to encompass more detail, allowing libraries\n+   built with different compilers (or different releases of the same\n+   compiler!) to be linked together. For C++, this includes many more\n+   details than for C, and CPU designers (for good reasons elaborated\n+   below) have not stepped up to publish C++ ABIs. The details include\n+   virtual function implementation, struct inheritance layout, name\n+   mangling, and exception handling. Such an ABI has been defined for GNU\n+   C++, and is immediately useful for embedded work relying only on a\n+   \"free-standing implementation\" that doesn't include (much of) the\n+   standard library. It is a good basis for the work to come.\n+\n+   A useful C++ ABI must also incorporate many details of the standard\n+   library implementation. For a C ABI, the layouts of a few structs\n+   (such as FILE, stat, jmpbuf, and the like) and a few macros suffice.\n+   For C++, the details include the complete set of names of functions\n+   and types used, the offsets of class members and virtual functions,\n+   and the actual definitions of all inlines. C++ exposes many more\n+   library details to the caller than C does. It makes defining a\n+   complete ABI a much bigger undertaking, and requires not just\n+   documenting library implementation details, but carefully designing\n+   those details so that future bug fixes and optimizations don't force\n+   breaking the ABI.\n+\n+   There are ways to help isolate library implementation details from the\n+   ABI, but they trade off against speed. Library details used in inner\n+   loops (e.g., getchar) must be exposed and frozen for all time, but\n+   many others may reasonably be kept hidden from user code, so they may\n+   later be changed. Deciding which, and implementing the decisions, must\n+   happen before you can reasonably document a candidate C++ ABI that\n+   encompasses the standard library.\n+     _________________________________________________________________\n+\n+   See [90]license.html for copying conditions.
