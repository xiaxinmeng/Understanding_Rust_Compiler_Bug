The C++ front end (g++), is an example of this --\n+it resides in the cp/ subdirectory.  Note that the C front end (also\n+referred to as gcc) is an exception to this, as its source files reside\n+in the gcc/ directory itself.\n+\n+libf2c/ contains the run-time libraries for the f2c program, also used\n+by g77.  These libraries normally referred to collectively as libf2c.\n+When built as part of g77, libf2c is installed under the name libg2c to avoid\n+conflict with any existing version of libf2c, and thus is often referred\n+to as libg2c when the g77 version is specifically being referred to.\n+\n+The netlib version of libf2c/ contains two distinct libraries, libF77 and\n+libI77, each in their own subdirectories.
