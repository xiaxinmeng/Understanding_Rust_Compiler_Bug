Also, if the library is\n+modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n+that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\n+author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\n+introduced by others.\n \f\n-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\n-software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\n-transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\n-we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\n-free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\n-GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\n-license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\n-designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\n-one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\n-the same as in the ordinary license.\n-\n-  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\n-they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\n-program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\n-changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\n-analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\n-a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\n-derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\n-treats it as such.\n-\n-  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\n-Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\n-sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\n-concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n-\n-  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\n-users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\n-libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\n-permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\n-preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\n-libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\n-this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\n-changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\n-will lead to faster development of free libraries.\n+  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\n+any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n+effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n+restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\n+any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\n+consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n+\n+  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\n+ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\n+General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\n+is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\n+this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\n+libraries into non-free programs.\n+\n+  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\n+a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\n+combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\n+General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\n+entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\n+Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\n+the library.\n+\n+  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\n+does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\n+Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\n+of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\n+are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\n+libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\n+special circumstances.\n+\n+  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n+encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\n+a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n+allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\n+library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\n+case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\n+software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n+\n+  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n+programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\n+free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n+non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\n+operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\n+system.\n+\n+  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\n+users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\n+linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\n+that program using a modified version of the Library.\n \n   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n-former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\n-works together with the library.\n-\n-  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\n-General Public License rather than by this special one.\n+former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\n+be combined with the library in order to run.\n \f\n-\t\t  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n+\t\t  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n \n-  0.

The hope is that this\n-will lead to faster development of free libraries.\n+  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\n+any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n+effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n+restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\n+any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\n+consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n+\n+  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\n+ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\n+General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\n+is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\n+this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\n+libraries into non-free programs.\n+\n+  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\n+a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\n+combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\n+General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\n+entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\n+Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\n+the library.\n+\n+  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\n+does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\n+Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\n+of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\n+are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\n+libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\n+special circumstances.\n+\n+  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n+encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\n+a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n+allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\n+library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\n+case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\n+software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n+\n+  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n+programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\n+free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n+non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\n+operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\n+system.\n+\n+  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\n+users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\n+linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\n+that program using a modified version of the Library.\n \n   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n modification follow.

Also, if the library is\n+modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n+that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\n+author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\n+introduced by others.\n \f\n-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\n-software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\n-transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\n-we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\n-free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\n-GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\n-license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\n-designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\n-one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\n-the same as in the ordinary license.\n-\n-  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\n-they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\n-program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\n-changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\n-analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\n-a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\n-derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\n-treats it as such.\n-\n-  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\n-Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\n-sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\n-concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n-\n-  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\n-users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\n-libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\n-permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\n-preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\n-libraries that are incorporated in them.
