It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that\n+bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that\n+the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n+\n+When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of\n+certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled\n+program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of\n+non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the\n+header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n+\n+0. Definitions.\n+\n+A file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime\n+Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an\n+interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based\n+on the Runtime Library.\n+\n+\"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without\n+modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of\n+the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any\n+subsequent versions published by the FSF.\n+\n+\"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,\n+modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with\n+the license of GCC.\n+\n+\"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual\n+target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for\n+input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution\n+phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any\n+format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used\n+for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n+\n+The \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in\n+non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in\n+Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,\n+use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered\n+part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be\n+understood as starting with the output of the generators or\n+preprocessors.\n+\n+A Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or\n+with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any\n+work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to\n+optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an\n+Eligible Compilation Process.\n+\n+1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n+\n+You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by\n+combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such\n+propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that\n+all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You\n+may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,\n+consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n+\n+2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n+\n+The availability of this Exception does not imply any general\n+presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft\n+requirements of the license of GCC.\n+"}, {"sha": "5b22f481afbc4cd5518f18e221c4c94524521e99", "filename": "ChangeLog", "status": "modified", "additions": 5, "deletions": 0, "changes": 5, "blob_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/748086b7b2201112aff2dea9d037af1fc92567ff/ChangeLog", "raw_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/raw/748086b7b2201112aff2dea9d037af1fc92567ff/ChangeLog", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/contents/ChangeLog?ref=748086b7b2201112aff2dea9d037af1fc92567ff", "patch": "@@ -1,3 +1,8 @@\n+2009-04-09  Nick Clifton  <nickc@redhat.com>\n+\n+\t* COPYING.RUNTIME: New file: Contains a copy of version 3.1 of\n+\tthe GCC Runtime Library Exception.\n+\n 2009-04-08  Kaveh R.
