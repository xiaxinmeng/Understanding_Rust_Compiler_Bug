The comparison operators in <iterator> are no\nlonger ambiguous with the rel_ops ones, so the linked mailing list\nthread and FAQ entry aren't relevant now. The reference to std_utility.h\nis also outdated as it's just called utility now, both in the source\ntree and when installed.\n\nThe use of rel_ops is still frowned upon though, so replace the\ndiscussion of ambiguities within libstdc++ headers with adminition about\nusing rel_ops in user code.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jonathan Wakely <jwakely@redhat.com>\n\nlibstdc++-v3/ChangeLog:\n\n\t*
