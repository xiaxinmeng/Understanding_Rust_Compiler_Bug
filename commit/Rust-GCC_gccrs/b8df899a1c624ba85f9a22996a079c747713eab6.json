Make sure you have done all the necessary preparations.\n-@xref{Other Dir}.\n-\n-@item\n-If you build GCC on a BSD system using a directory stored in a System\n-V file system, problems may occur in running @code{fixincludes} if the\n-System V file system doesn't support symbolic links.  These problems\n-result in a failure to fix the declaration of @code{size_t} in\n-@file{sys/types.h}.  If you find that @code{size_t} is a signed type and\n-that type mismatches occur, this could be the cause.\n-\n-The solution is not to use such a directory for building GCC.\n-\n-@item\n-Some commands executed when making the compiler may fail (return a\n-non-zero status) and be ignored by @code{make}.  These failures, which\n-are often due to files that were not found, are expected, and can safely\n-be ignored.\n-\n-@item\n-It is normal to have warnings in compiling certain files about\n-unreachable code and about enumeration type clashes.  These files' names\n-begin with @samp{insn-}.  Also, @file{real.c} may get some warnings that\n-you can ignore.\n-\n-@item\n-Sometimes @code{make} recompiles parts of the compiler when installing\n-the compiler.  In one case, this was traced down to a bug in\n-@code{make}.  Either ignore the problem or switch to GNU Make.\n-\n-@item\n-On GNU/Linux SLS 1.01, there is a problem with @file{libc.a}: it does not\n-contain the obstack functions.  However, GCC assumes that the obstack\n-functions are in @file{libc.a} when it is the GNU C library.  To work\n-around this problem, change the @code{__GNU_LIBRARY__} conditional\n-around line 31 to @samp{#if 1}.\n-\n-@item\n-On SCO systems, when compiling GCC with the system's compiler,\n-do not use @samp{-O}.  Some versions of the system's compiler miscompile\n-GCC with @samp{-O}.\n-\n-@cindex @code{genflags}, crash on Sun 4\n-@item\n-Sometimes on a Sun 4 you may observe a crash in the program\n-@code{genflags} or @code{genoutput} while building GCC.  This is said to\n-be due to a bug in @code{sh}.  You can probably get around it by running\n-@code{genflags} or @code{genoutput} manually and then retrying the\n-@code{make}.\n-\n-@item\n-On Solaris 2, executables of GCC version 2.0.2 are commonly\n-available, but they have a bug that shows up when compiling current\n-versions of GCC: undefined symbol errors occur during assembly if you\n-use @samp{-g}.\n-\n-The solution is to compile the current version of GCC without\n-@samp{-g}.  That makes a working compiler which you can use to recompile\n-with @samp{-g}.\n-\n-@item\n-Solaris 2 comes with a number of optional OS packages.  Some of these\n-packages are needed to use GCC fully.  If you did not install all\n-optional packages when installing Solaris, you will need to verify that\n-the packages that GCC needs are installed.\n-\n-To check whether an optional package is installed, use\n-the @code{pkginfo} command.  To add an optional package, use the\n-@code{pkgadd} command.  For further details, see the Solaris\n-documentation.\n-\n-For Solaris 2.0 and 2.1, GCC needs six packages: @samp{SUNWarc},\n-@samp{SUNWbtool}, @samp{SUNWesu}, @samp{SUNWhea}, @samp{SUNWlibm}, and\n-@samp{SUNWtoo}.\n-\n-For Solaris 2.2, GCC needs an additional seventh package: @samp{SUNWsprot}.\n-\n-@item\n-On Solaris 2, trying to use the linker and other tools in\n-@file{/usr/ucb} to install GCC has been observed to cause trouble.\n-For example, the linker may hang indefinitely.  The fix is to remove\n-@file{/usr/ucb} from your @code{PATH}.\n-\n-@item\n-If you use the 1.31 version of the MIPS assembler (such as was shipped\n-with Ultrix 3.1), you will need to use the -fno-delayed-branch switch\n-when optimizing floating point code.  Otherwise, the assembler will\n-complain when the GCC compiler fills a branch delay slot with a\n-floating point instruction, such as @code{add.d}.\n-\n-@item\n-If on a MIPS system you get an error message saying ``does not have gp\n-sections for all it's [sic] sectons [sic]'', don't worry about it.  This\n-happens whenever you use GAS with the MIPS linker, but there is not\n-really anything wrong, and it is okay to use the output file.  You can\n-stop such warnings by installing the GNU linker.\n-\n-It would be nice to extend GAS to produce the gp tables, but they are\n-optional, and there should not be a warning about their absence.\n-\n-@item\n-Users have reported some problems with version 2.0 of the MIPS\n-compiler tools that were shipped with Ultrix 4.1.  Version 2.10\n-which came with Ultrix 4.2 seems to work fine.\n-\n-Users have also reported some problems with version 2.20 of the\n-MIPS compiler tools that were shipped with RISC/os 4.x.  The earlier\n-version 2.11 seems to work fine.\n-\n-@item\n-Some versions of the MIPS linker will issue an assertion failure\n-when linking code that uses @code{alloca} against shared\n-libraries on RISC-OS 5.0, and DEC's OSF/1 systems.  This is a bug\n-in the linker, that is supposed to be fixed in future revisions.\n-To protect against this, GCC passes @samp{-non_shared} to the\n-linker unless you pass an explicit @samp{-shared} or\n-@samp{-call_shared} switch.\n-\n-@item\n-On System V release 3, you may get this error message\n-while linking:\n-\n-@smallexample\n-ld fatal: failed to write symbol name @var{something}\n- in strings table for file @var{whatever}\n-@end smallexample\n-\n-This probably indicates that the disk is full or your ULIMIT won't allow\n-the file to be as large as it needs to be.\n-\n-This problem can also result because the kernel parameter @code{MAXUMEM}\n-is too small.  If so, you must regenerate the kernel and make the value\n-much larger.  The default value is reported to be 1024; a value of 32768\n-is said to work.  Smaller values may also work.\n-\n-@item\n-On System V, if you get an error like this,\n-\n-@example\n-/usr/local/lib/bison.simple: In function `yyparse':\n-/usr/local/lib/bison.simple:625: virtual memory exhausted\n-@end example\n-\n-@noindent\n-that too indicates a problem with disk space, ULIMIT, or @code{MAXUMEM}.\n-\n-@item\n-Current GCC versions probably do not work on version 2 of the NeXT\n-operating system.\n-\n-@item\n-On NeXTStep 3.0, the Objective C compiler does not work, due,\n-apparently, to a kernel bug that it happens to trigger.  This problem\n-does not happen on 3.1.\n-\n-@item\n-On the Tower models 4@var{n}0 and 6@var{n}0, by default a process is not\n-allowed to have more than one megabyte of memory.  GCC cannot compile\n-itself (or many other programs) with @samp{-O} in that much memory.\n-\n-To solve this problem, reconfigure the kernel adding the following line\n-to the configuration file:\n-\n-@smallexample\n-MAXUMEM = 4096\n-@end smallexample\n-\n-@item\n-On HP 9000 series 300 or 400 running HP-UX release 8.0, there is a bug\n-in the assembler that must be fixed before GCC can be built.

The bug on ``cvtnum(3c)'' is\n-SR#4701-078451.  Anyway, the attached assembler uses the archive\n-library version of ``cvtnum(3c)'' and thus does not exhibit the bug.\n-@end quotation\n-\n-This patch is also known as PHCO_4484.\n-\n-@item\n-On HP-UX version 8.05, but not on 8.07 or more recent versions,\n-the @code{fixproto} shell script triggers a bug in the system shell.\n-If you encounter this problem, upgrade your operating system or\n-use BASH (the GNU shell) to run @code{fixproto}.\n-\n-@item\n-There may be similar problems on System V Release 3.1 on 386 systems.\n-\n-@item\n-On the Intel Paragon (an i860 machine), if you are using operating\n-system version 1.0, you will get warnings or errors about redefinition\n-of @code{va_arg} when you build GCC.\n-\n-If this happens, then you need to link most programs with the library\n-@file{iclib.a}.

This happens using system versions V.2.2 1.0gT1 and\n-V.2.2 1.0e and perhaps later versions as well.

It gets the version to use from\n+the system header file @file{/usr/include/stamp.h}.  If you install a\n+new version of DEC Unix, you should rebuild GCC to pick up the new version\n+stamp.\n+\n+Note that since the Alpha is a 64-bit architecture, cross-compilers from\n+32-bit machines will not generate code as efficient as that generated\n+when the compiler is running on a 64-bit machine because many\n+optimizations that depend on being able to represent a word on the\n+target in an integral value on the host cannot be performed.  Building\n+cross-compilers on the Alpha for 32-bit machines has only been tested in\n+a few cases and may not work properly.\n+\n+@code{make compare} may fail on old versions of DEC Unix unless you add\n+@samp{-save-temps} to @code{CFLAGS}.  On these systems, the name of the\n+assembler input file is stored in the object file, and that makes\n+comparison fail if it differs between the @code{stage1} and\n+@code{stage2} compilations.  The option @samp{-save-temps} forces a\n+fixed name to be used for the assembler input file, instead of a\n+randomly chosen name in @file{/tmp}.  Do not add @samp{-save-temps}\n+unless the comparisons fail without that option.  If you add\n+@samp{-save-temps}, you will have to manually delete the @samp{.i} and\n+@samp{.s} files after each series of compilations.\n+\n+GNU CC now supports both the native (ECOFF) debugging format used by DBX\n+and GDB and an encapsulated STABS format for use only with GDB.  See the\n+discussion of the @samp{--with-stabs} option of @file{configure} above\n+for more information on these formats and how to select them.\n+\n+There is a bug in DEC's assembler that produces incorrect line numbers\n+for ECOFF format when the @samp{.align} directive is used.  To work\n+around this problem, GNU CC will not emit such alignment directives\n+while writing ECOFF format debugging information even if optimization is\n+being performed.  Unfortunately, this has the very undesirable\n+side-effect that code addresses when @samp{-O} is specified are\n+different depending on whether or not @samp{-g} is also specified.\n+\n+To avoid this behavior, specify @samp{-gstabs+} and use GDB instead of\n+DBX.
