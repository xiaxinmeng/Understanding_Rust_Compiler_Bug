incorrect suggestion in ignore_bb_p\n\nIn commit ab3f4b27abe \"[omp, ftracer] Don't duplicate blocks in SIMT region\" I\nadded a comment in ignore_bb_p suggesting a reordering of SIMT_VOTE_ANY and\nSIMT_EXIT, which is not possible since VOTE_ANY may have data dependencies to\nstorage that is deallocated by SIMT_EXIT.\n\nI've now opened a PR (PR97291) to describe the problem the reordering was\nintended to fix.\n\nRemove the incorrect suggestion.\n\ngcc/ChangeLog:\n\n2020-10-05  Tom de Vries  <tdevries@suse.de>\n\n\t* tracer.c (ignore_bb_p): Remove incorrect suggestion.", "tree":
