The most effective approach known is to encourage\n-commercial redistributors to donate.\n-\n-Users of free software systems can boost the pace of development by\n-encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their selling price\n-to free software developers---the Free Software Foundation, and others.\n-\n-The way to convince distributors to do this is to demand it and expect\n-it from them.  So when you compare distributors, judge them partly by\n-how much they give to free software development.  Show distributors\n-they must compete to be the one who gives the most.\n-\n-To make this approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can\n-compare, such as, ``We will donate ten dollars to the Frobnitz project\n-for each disk sold.''  Don't be satisfied with a vague promise, such as\n-``A portion of the profits are donated,'' since it doesn't give a basis\n-for comparison.\n-\n-Even a precise fraction ``of the profits from this disk'' is not very\n-meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated business decisions\n-can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit.\n-If the price you pay is $50, ten percent of the profit is probably\n-less than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or nothing at all.\n-\n-Some redistributors do development work themselves.  This is useful too;\n-but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire how much they do, and\n-what kind.  Some kinds of development make much more long-term\n-difference than others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of\n-a program contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of a\n-program for the whole community contributes much.  Easy new ports\n-contribute little, since someone else would surely do them; difficult\n-ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU Compiler Collection contribute more;\n-major new features or packages contribute the most.\n-\n-By establishing the idea that supporting further development is ``the\n-proper thing to do'' when distributing free software for a fee, we can\n-assure a steady flow of resources into making more free software.\n-\n-@display\n-Copyright (C) 1994 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n-Verbatim copying and redistribution of this section is permitted\n-without royalty; alteration is not permitted.\n-@end display\n+@include funding.texi\n \n @node GNU/Linux\n @unnumbered Linux and the GNU Project\n@@ -4315,398 +4268,7 @@ name ``Linux'' ambiguously.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\n-License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\n-software---to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\n-General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\n-Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\n-using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\n-the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\n-your programs, too.\n-\n-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n-\n-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n-gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n-you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n-source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\n-rights.\n-\n-  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n-distribute and/or modify the software.\n-\n-  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n-software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n-authors' reputations.\n-\n-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n-program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n-program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n-patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.\n-\n-@iftex\n-@unnumberedsec TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-@end iftex\n-@ifnottex\n-@center TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-@end ifnottex\n-\n-@enumerate 0\n-@item\n-This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n-a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n-under the terms of this General Public License.  The ``Program'', below,\n-refers to any such program or work, and a ``work based on the Program''\n-means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n-that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n-either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n-language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n-the term ``modification''.)  Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.\n-\n-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n-running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n-is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n-Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n-Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-@item\n-You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n-source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n-conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n-copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n-notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n-and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n-along with the Program.\n-\n-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-@item\n-You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n-of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-@enumerate a\n-@item\n-You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n-stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-@item\n-You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n-whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n-part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n-parties under the terms of this License.\n-\n-@item\n-If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n-when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n-interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n-announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n-notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n-a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n-these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n-License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n-does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n-the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n-@end enumerate\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n-on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-collective works based on the Program.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n-the scope of this License.\n-\n-@item\n-You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n-\n-@enumerate a\n-@item\n-Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n-source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n-1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-@item\n-Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n-years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n-cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n-machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n-distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n-customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-@item\n-Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n-to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n-allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n-received the program in object code or executable form with such\n-an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n-@end enumerate\n-\n-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\n-code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n-control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\n-special exception, the source code distributed need not include\n-anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n-form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n-operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n-itself accompanies the executable.\n-\n-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n-access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n-access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n-distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-@item\n-You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n-except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n-otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n-void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n-However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n-this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n-parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-@item\n-You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Program or works based on it.\n-\n-@item\n-Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n-these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n-this License.\n-\n-@item\n-If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n-may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n-circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n-implemented by public license practices.

The most effective approach known is to encourage\n+commercial redistributors to donate.\n+\n+Users of free software systems can boost the pace of development by\n+encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their selling price\n+to free software developers---the Free Software Foundation, and others.\n+\n+The way to convince distributors to do this is to demand it and expect\n+it from them.  So when you compare distributors, judge them partly by\n+how much they give to free software development.  Show distributors\n+they must compete to be the one who gives the most.\n+\n+To make this approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can\n+compare, such as, ``We will donate ten dollars to the Frobnitz project\n+for each disk sold.''  Don't be satisfied with a vague promise, such as\n+``A portion of the profits are donated,'' since it doesn't give a basis\n+for comparison.\n+\n+Even a precise fraction ``of the profits from this disk'' is not very\n+meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated business decisions\n+can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit.\n+If the price you pay is $50, ten percent of the profit is probably\n+less than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or nothing at all.\n+\n+Some redistributors do development work themselves.  This is useful too;\n+but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire how much they do, and\n+what kind.  Some kinds of development make much more long-term\n+difference than others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of\n+a program contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of a\n+program for the whole community contributes much.  Easy new ports\n+contribute little, since someone else would surely do them; difficult\n+ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU Compiler Collection contribute more;\n+major new features or packages contribute the most.\n+\n+By establishing the idea that supporting further development is ``the\n+proper thing to do'' when distributing free software for a fee, we can\n+assure a steady flow of resources into making more free software.\n+\n+@display\n+Copyright (C) 1994 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n+Verbatim copying and redistribution of this section is permitted\n+without royalty; alteration is not permitted.\n+@end display"}, {"sha": "1c9d85a96bc00a16011d35377d78a5a053396914", "filename": "gcc/doc/include/gpl.texi", "status": "added", "additions": 392, "deletions": 0, "changes": 392, "blob_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/0671eaf68f6bbc1a977583e592552d5b68c7f576/gcc%2Fdoc%2Finclude%2Fgpl.texi", "raw_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/raw/0671eaf68f6bbc1a977583e592552d5b68c7f576/gcc%2Fdoc%2Finclude%2Fgpl.texi", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/contents/gcc%2Fdoc%2Finclude%2Fgpl.texi?ref=0671eaf68f6bbc1a977583e592552d5b68c7f576", "patch": "@@ -0,0 +1,392 @@\n+@node Copying\n+@unnumbered GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n+@center Version 2, June 1991\n+\n+@display\n+Copyright @copyright{} 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n+59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA\n+\n+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n+of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n+@end display\n+\n+@unnumberedsec Preamble\n+\n+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\n+software---to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\n+General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\n+Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\n+using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\n+the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\n+your programs, too.\n+\n+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n+\n+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n+\n+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n+gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n+you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n+source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\n+rights.\n+\n+  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n+distribute and/or modify the software.\n+\n+  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n+software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n+authors' reputations.\n+\n+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n+program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n+\n+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n+modification follow.\n+\n+@iftex\n+@unnumberedsec TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n+@end iftex\n+@ifnottex\n+@center TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n+@end ifnottex\n+\n+@enumerate 0\n+@item\n+This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n+under the terms of this General Public License.  The ``Program'', below,\n+refers to any such program or work, and a ``work based on the Program''\n+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n+either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n+language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n+the term ``modification''.)  Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.\n+\n+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n+Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n+\n+@item\n+You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n+along with the Program.\n+\n+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n+\n+@item\n+You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n+\n+@enumerate a\n+@item\n+You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n+stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n+\n+@item\n+You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n+whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n+part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n+parties under the terms of this License.\n+\n+@item\n+If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n+when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n+interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n+announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n+notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n+a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n+these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n+License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n+does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n+the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n+@end enumerate\n+\n+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n+\n+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n+collective works based on the Program.\n+\n+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n+the scope of this License.\n+\n+@item\n+You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n+\n+@enumerate a\n+@item\n+Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n+source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n+1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n+\n+@item\n+Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n+years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n+cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n+machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n+distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n+customarily used for software interchange; or,\n+\n+@item\n+Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n+to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n+allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n+received the program in object code or executable form with such\n+an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n+@end enumerate\n+\n+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\n+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\n+special exception, the source code distributed need not include\n+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n+itself accompanies the executable.\n+\n+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n+\n+@item\n+You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n+parties remain in full compliance.\n+\n+@item\n+You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n+the Program or works based on it.\n+\n+@item\n+Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n+this License.\n+\n+@item\n+If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n+refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n+\n+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n+apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n+circumstances.\n+\n+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n+integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n+impose that choice.\n+\n+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n+be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n+\n+@item\n+If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n+original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\n+may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\n+those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\n+countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\n+the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n+\n+@item\n+The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n+of the General Public License from time to time.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\n-License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\n-software---to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\n-General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\n-Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\n-using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\n-the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\n-your programs, too.\n-\n-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n-\n-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n-gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n-you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n-source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\n-rights.\n-\n-  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n-distribute and/or modify the software.\n-\n-  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n-software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n-authors' reputations.\n-\n-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n-program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n-program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n-patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.\n-\n-@iftex\n-@unnumberedsec TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-@end iftex\n-@ifinfo\n-@center TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-@end ifinfo\n-\n-@enumerate 0\n-@item\n-This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n-a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n-under the terms of this General Public License.  The ``Program'', below,\n-refers to any such program or work, and a ``work based on the Program''\n-means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n-that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n-either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n-language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n-the term ``modification''.)  Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.\n-\n-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n-running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n-is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n-Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n-Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-@item\n-You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n-source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n-conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n-copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n-notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n-and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n-along with the Program.\n-\n-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-@item\n-You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n-of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-@enumerate a\n-@item\n-You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n-stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-@item\n-You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n-whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n-part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n-parties under the terms of this License.\n-\n-@item\n-If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n-when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n-interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n-announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n-notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n-a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n-these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n-License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n-does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n-the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n-@end enumerate\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n-on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-collective works based on the Program.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n-the scope of this License.\n-\n-@item\n-You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n-\n-@enumerate a\n-@item\n-Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n-source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n-1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-@item\n-Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n-years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n-cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n-machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n-distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n-customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-@item\n-Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n-to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n-allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n-received the program in object code or executable form with such\n-an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n-@end enumerate\n-\n-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\n-code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n-control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\n-special exception, the source code distributed need not include\n-anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n-form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n-operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n-itself accompanies the executable.\n-\n-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n-access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n-access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n-distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-@item\n-You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n-except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n-otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n-void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n-However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n-this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n-parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-@item\n-You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Program or works based on it.\n-\n-@item\n-Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n-these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n-this License.\n-\n-@item\n-If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n-may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n-circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n-impose that choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n-be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-@item\n-If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\n-may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\n-those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\n-countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\n-the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n-\n-@item\n-The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n-of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n-be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n-address new problems or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ``any\n-later version'', you have the option of following the terms and conditions\n-either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n-Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\n-this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\n-Foundation.\n-\n-@item\n-If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n-programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\n-to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\n-Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n-make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\n-of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\n-of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n-\n-@iftex\n-@heading NO WARRANTY\n-@end iftex\n-@ifinfo\n-@center NO WARRANTY\n-@end ifinfo\n-\n-@item\n-BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\n-FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

It is safest\n-to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n-the ``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-@smallexample\n-@var{one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}\n-Copyright (C) @var{year}  @var{name of author}\n-\n-This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n-it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n-the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n-(at your option) any later version.\n-\n-This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n-but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n-MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The most effective approach known is to encourage\n-commercial redistributors to donate.\n-\n-Users of free software systems can boost the pace of development by\n-encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their selling price\n-to free software developers---the Free Software Foundation, and others.\n-\n-The way to convince distributors to do this is to demand it and expect\n-it from them.  So when you compare distributors, judge them partly by\n-how much they give to free software development.  Show distributors\n-they must compete to be the one who gives the most.\n-\n-To make this approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can\n-compare, such as, ``We will donate ten dollars to the Frobnitz project\n-for each disk sold.''  Don't be satisfied with a vague promise, such as\n-``A portion of the profits are donated,'' since it doesn't give a basis\n-for comparison.\n-\n-Even a precise fraction ``of the profits from this disk'' is not very\n-meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated business decisions\n-can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit.\n-If the price you pay is $50, ten percent of the profit is probably\n-less than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or nothing at all.\n-\n-Some redistributors do development work themselves.  This is useful too;\n-but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire how much they do, and\n-what kind.  Some kinds of development make much more long-term\n-difference than others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of\n-a program contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of a\n-program for the whole community contributes much.  Easy new ports\n-contribute little, since someone else would surely do them; difficult\n-ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU C compiler contribute more;\n-major new features or packages contribute the most.\n-\n-By establishing the idea that supporting further development is ``the\n-proper thing to do'' when distributing free software for a fee, we can\n-assure a steady flow of resources into making more free software.\n-\n-@display\n-Copyright (C) 1994 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n-Verbatim copying and redistribution of this section is permitted\n-without royalty; alteration is not permitted.\n-@end display\n+@include funding.texi\n \n @node Funding GNU Fortran\n @chapter Funding GNU Fortran\n@@ -850,18 +413,6 @@ Email @email{@value{email-general}} to volunteer for this work.\n \n @xref{Funding,,Funding Free Software}, for more information.\n \n-@node Look and Feel\n-@chapter Protect Your Freedom---Fight ``Look And Feel''\n-@c the above chapter heading overflows onto the next line. --mew 1/26/93\n-\n-To preserve the ability to write free software, including replacements\n-for proprietary software, authors must be free to replicate the\n-user interface to which users of existing software have become\n-accustomed.\n-\n-@xref{Look and Feel,,Protect Your Freedom---Fight ``Look And Feel'',\n-gcc,Using and Porting GNU CC}, for more information.\n-\n @node Getting Started\n @chapter Getting Started\n @cindex getting started"}, {"sha": "8d4709fff6c20d8d55414c6a9e84f2e6b2ee2c3f", "filename": "gcc/java/ChangeLog", "status": "modified", "additions": 6, "deletions": 0, "changes": 6, "blob_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/0671eaf68f6bbc1a977583e592552d5b68c7f576/gcc%2Fjava%2FChangeLog", "raw_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/raw/0671eaf68f6bbc1a977583e592552d5b68c7f576/gcc%2Fjava%2FChangeLog", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/contents/gcc%2Fjava%2FChangeLog?ref=0671eaf68f6bbc1a977583e592552d5b68c7f576", "patch": "@@ -1,3 +1,9 @@\n+2001-07-04  Joseph S.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\n-License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\n-software---to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\n-General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\n-Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\n-using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\n-the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\n-your programs, too.\n-\n-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n-\n-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n-gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n-you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n-source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\n-rights.\n-\n-  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n-distribute and/or modify the software.\n-\n-  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n-software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n-authors' reputations.\n-\n-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n-program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n-program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n-patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.\n-\n-@iftex\n-@unnumberedsec TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-@end iftex\n-@ifinfo\n-@center TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-@end ifinfo\n-\n-@enumerate 0\n-@item\n-This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n-a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n-under the terms of this General Public License.  The ``Program'', below,\n-refers to any such program or work, and a ``work based on the Program''\n-means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n-that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n-either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n-language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n-the term ``modification''.)  Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.\n-\n-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n-running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n-is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n-Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n-Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-@item\n-You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n-source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n-conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n-copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n-notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n-and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n-along with the Program.\n-\n-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-@item\n-You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n-of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-@enumerate a\n-@item\n-You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n-stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-@item\n-You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n-whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n-part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n-parties under the terms of this License.\n-\n-@item\n-If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n-when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n-interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n-announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n-notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n-a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n-these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n-License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n-does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n-the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n-@end enumerate\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n-on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-collective works based on the Program.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n-the scope of this License.\n-\n-@item\n-You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n-\n-@enumerate a\n-@item\n-Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n-source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n-1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-@item\n-Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n-years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n-cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n-machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n-distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n-customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-@item\n-Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n-to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n-allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n-received the program in object code or executable form with such\n-an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n-@end enumerate\n-\n-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\n-code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n-control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\n-special exception, the source code distributed need not include\n-anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n-form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n-operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n-itself accompanies the executable.\n-\n-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n-access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n-access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n-distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-@item\n-You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n-except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n-otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n-void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n-However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n-this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n-parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-@item\n-You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Program or works based on it.\n-\n-@item\n-Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n-these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n-this License.\n-\n-@item\n-If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n-may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n-circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n-impose that choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n-be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-@item\n-If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\n-may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\n-those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\n-countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\n-the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n-\n-@item\n-The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n-of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n-be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n-address new problems or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ``any\n-later version'', you have the option of following the terms and conditions\n-either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n-Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\n-this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\n-Foundation.\n-\n-@item\n-If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n-programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\n-to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\n-Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n-make exceptions for this.
