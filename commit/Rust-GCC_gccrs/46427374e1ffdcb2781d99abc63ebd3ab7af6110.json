Tom Tromey did the original work\nand attached the patch to PR preprocessor/7263.  This opus is a\nderivative of that original work.\n\nThis patch modifies the linemap module of libcpp to add virtual\nlocations support.\n\nA virtual location is a mapped location that can resolve to several\ndifferent physical locations.  It can always resolve to the spelling\nlocation of a token.  For tokens resulting from macro expansion it can\nresolve to:\n  - either the location of the expansion point of the macro.\n  - or the location of the token in the definition of the\n  macro\n  - or, if the token is an argument of a function-like macro,\n  the location of the use of the matching macro parameter in\n  the definition of the macro\n\nThe patch creates a new type of line map called a macro map.  For every\nsingle macro expansion, there is a macro map that generates a virtual\nlocation for every single resulting token of the expansion.\n\nThe good old type of line map we all know is now called an ordinary\nmap.  That one still encodes spelling locations as it has always had.\n\nAs a result linemap_lookup as been extended to return a macro map when\ngiven a virtual location resulting from a macro expansion.  The layout\nof structs line_map has changed to support this new type of map.  So\ndid the layout of struct line_maps.  Accessor macros have been\nintroduced to avoid messing with the implementation details of these\ndatastructures directly.  This helped already as we have been testing\ndifferent ways of arranging these datastructure.  Having to constantly\nadjust client code that is too tied with the internals of line_map and\nline_maps would have been even more painful.\n\nOf course, many new public functions have been added to the linemap\nmodule to handle the resolution of virtual locations.\n\nThis patch introduces the infrastructure but no part of the compiler\nuses virtual locations yet.\n\nHowever the client code of the linemap data structures has been\nadjusted as per the changes.  E.g, it's not anymore reliable for a\nclient code to manipulate struct line_map directly if it just wants to\ndeal with spelling locations, because struct line_map can now\nrepresent a macro map as well.  In that case, it's better to use the\nconvenient API to resolve the initial (possibly virtual) location to a\nspelling location (or to an ordinary map) and use that.\n\nThis is the reason why the patch adjusts the Java, Ada and Fortran\nfront ends.\n\nAlso, note that virtual locations are not supposed to be ordered for\nrelations '<' and '>' anymore.  To test if a virtual location appears\n\"before\" another one, one has to use a new operator exposed by the\nline map interface.  The patch updates the only spot (in the\ndiagnostics module) I have found that was making the assumption that\nlocations were ordered for these relations.  This is the only change\nthat introduces a use of the new line map API in this patch, so I am\nadding a regression test for it only.\n\nFrom-SVN: r180081", "tree": {"sha": "202b8180f693619f1878beec9e49e08c0fe4ddd3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/git/trees/202b8180f693619f1878beec9e49e08c0fe4ddd3"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/git/commits/46427374e1ffdcb2781d99abc63ebd3ab7af6110", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/46427374e1ffdcb2781d99abc63ebd3ab7af6110", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commit/46427374e1ffdcb2781d99abc63ebd3ab7af6110", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/46427374e1ffdcb2781d99abc63ebd3ab7af6110/comments", "author": null, "committer": null, "parents": [{"sha": "2be4314f3d92e4c8d39561a1a90a0a8b2888dfd2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commits/2be4314f3d92e4c8d39561a1a90a0a8b2888dfd2", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/commit/2be4314f3d92e4c8d39561a1a90a0a8b2888dfd2"}], "stats": {"total": 1974, "additions": 1767, "deletions": 207}, "files": [{"sha": "a6f0e003e90f34bce61cdebef73059d666b9ed9d", "filename": "gcc/ChangeLog", "status": "modified", "additions": 15, "deletions": 0, "changes": 15, "blob_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/46427374e1ffdcb2781d99abc63ebd3ab7af6110/gcc%2FChangeLog", "raw_url": "https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/raw/46427374e1ffdcb2781d99abc63ebd3ab7af6110/gcc%2FChangeLog", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Rust-GCC/gccrs/contents/gcc%2FChangeLog?ref=46427374e1ffdcb2781d99abc63ebd3ab7af6110", "patch": "@@ -1,3 +1,18 @@\n+2011-10-15  Tom Tromey  <tromey@redhat>\n+\t    Dodji Seketeli  <dodji@redhat.com>\n+\n+\t* input.h (struct expanded_location): Move to libcpp/line-map.h.\n+\t(LOCATION_COLUMN): New accessor\n+\t(in_system_header_at): Use linemap_location_in_system_header_p.\n+\t* diagnostic.c (diagnostic_report_current_module): Adjust to avoid\n+\ttouching the internals of struct line_map.
