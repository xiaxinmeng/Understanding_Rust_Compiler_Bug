Pledge\n+\n+We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our\n+community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body\n+size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender\n+identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,\n+nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity\n+and orientation.\n+\n+We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,\n+diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.\n+\n+## Our Standards\n+\n+Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our\n+community include:\n+\n+* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people\n+* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences\n+* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback\n+* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,\n+  and learning from the experience\n+* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the\n+  overall community\n+\n+Examples of unacceptable behavior include:\n+\n+* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or\n+  advances of any kind\n+* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n+* Public or private harassment\n+* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email\n+  address, without their explicit permission\n+* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a\n+  professional setting\n+\n+## Enforcement Responsibilities\n+\n+Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of\n+acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in\n+response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,\n+or harmful.\n+\n+Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject\n+comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are\n+not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation\n+decisions when appropriate.\n+\n+## Scope\n+\n+This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when\n+an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.\n+Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,\n+posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed\n+representative at an online or offline event.\n+\n+## Enforcement\n+\n+Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be\n+reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at\n+https://github.com/orgs/Rust-GCC/people.\n+All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.\n+\n+All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the\n+reporter of any incident.\n+\n+## Enforcement Guidelines\n+\n+Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining\n+the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:\n+\n+### 1. Correction\n+\n+**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed\n+unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n+\n+**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing\n+clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the\n+behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n+\n+### 2. Warning\n+\n+**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series\n+of actions.\n+\n+**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No\n+interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with\n+those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This\n+includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels\n+like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or\n+permanent ban.\n+\n+### 3. Temporary Ban\n+\n+**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including\n+sustained inappropriate behavior.\n+\n+**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public\n+communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or\n+private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction\n+with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.\n+Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n+\n+### 4. Permanent Ban\n+\n+**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community\n+standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an\n+individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\n+\n+**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within\n+the community.\n+\n+## Attribution\n+\n+This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],\n+version 2.0, available at\n+https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.\n+\n+Community Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct\n+enforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).\n+\n+[homepage]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org\n+\n+For answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at\n+https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.
