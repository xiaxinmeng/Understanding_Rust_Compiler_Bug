additional lints, to help its users write more correct\n+and idiomatic Rust code. A full list of all lints, that can be filtered by\n+category, lint level or keywords, can be found in the [Clippy lint\n+documentation].\n+\n+This chapter will give an overview of the different lint categories, which kind\n+of lints they offer and recommended actions when you should see a lint out of\n+that category. For examples, see the [Clippy lint documentation] and filter by\n+category.\n+\n+The different lint groups were defined in the [Clippy 1.0 RFC].\n+\n+## Correctness\n+\n+The `clippy::correctness` group is the only lint group in Clippy which lints are\n+deny-by-default and abort the compilation when triggered. This is for good\n+reason: If you see a `correctness` lint, it means that your code is outright\n+wrong or useless and you should try to fix it.\n+\n+Lints in this category are carefully picked and should be free of false\n+positives. So just `#[allow]`ing those lints is not recommended.\n+\n+## Suspicious\n+\n+The `clippy::suspicious` group is similar to the correctness lints in that it\n+contains lints that trigger on code that is really _sus_ and should be fixed. As\n+opposed to correctness lints, it might be possible that the linted code is\n+intentionally written like it is.\n+\n+It is still recommended to fix code that is linted by lints out of this group\n+instead of `#[allow]`ing the lint. In case you intentionally have written code\n+that offends the lint you should specifically and locally `#[allow]` the lint\n+and add give a reason why the code is correct as written.\n+\n+## Complexity\n+\n+The `clippy::complexity` group offers lints that give you suggestions on how to\n+simplify your code. It mostly focuses on code that can be written in a shorter\n+and more readable way, while preserving the semantics.\n+\n+If you should see a complexity lint, it usually means that you can remove or\n+replace some code and it is recommended to do so. However, if you need the more\n+complex code for some expressiveness reason, it is recommended to allow\n+complexity lints on a case-by-case basis.\n+\n+## Perf\n+\n+The `clippy::perf` group gives you suggestions on how you can increase the\n+performance of your code. Those lints are mostly about code that the compiler\n+can't trivially optimize, but has to be written in a slightly different way to\n+make the optimizer's job easier.\n+\n+Perf lints are usually easy to apply and it is recommended to do so.\n+\n+## Style\n+\n+The `clippy::style` group is mostly about writing idiomatic code. Because style\n+is subjective, this lint group is the most opinionated warn-by-default group in\n+Clippy.\n+\n+If you see a style lint, applying the suggestion usually makes your code more\n+readable and idiomatic. But because we know that this is opinionated, feel free\n+to sprinkle `#[allow]`s for style lints in your code or `#![allow]` a style lint\n+on your whole crate if you disagree with the suggested style completely.\n+\n+## Pedantic\n+\n+The `clippy::pedantic` group makes Clippy even more _pedantic_. You can enable\n+the whole group with `#![warn(clippy::pedantic)]` in the `lib.rs`/`main.rs` of\n+your crate. This lint group is for Clippy power users that want an in depth\n+check of their code.\n+\n+> _Note:_ Instead of enabling the whole group (like Clippy itself does), you may\n+> want to cherry-pick lints out of the pedantic group.\n+\n+If you enable this group, expect to also use `#[allow]` attributes generously\n+throughout your code. Lints in this group are designed to be pedantic and false\n+positives sometimes are intentional in order to prevent false negatives.\n+\n+## Restriction\n+\n+The `clippy::restriction` group contains lints that will _restrict_ you from\n+using certain parts of the Rust language. It is **not** recommended to enable\n+the whole group, but rather cherry-pick lints that are useful for your code base\n+and your use case.\n+\n+> _Note:_ Clippy will produce a warning if it finds a\n+> `#![warn(clippy::restriction)]` attribute in your code!\n+\n+Lints from this group will restrict you in some way. If you enable a restriction\n+lint for your crate it is recommended to also fix code that this lint triggers\n+on. However, those lints are really strict by design and you might want to\n+`#[allow]` them in some special cases, with a comment justifying that.\n+\n+## Cargo\n+\n+The `clippy::cargo` group gives you suggestions on how to improve your\n+`Cargo.toml` file. This might be especially interesting if you want to publish\n+your crate and are not sure if you have all useful information in your\n+`Cargo.toml`.\n+\n+[Clippy lint documentation]:
