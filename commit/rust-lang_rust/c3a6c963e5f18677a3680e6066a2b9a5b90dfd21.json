This occurs due to the VFS changes and\nthe in memory file contents being updated immediately, while\n`process_changes` processes the events afterwards in sequence which no\nlonger works as it will only observe the final file contents. By\nfolding these events together, we will no longer try to process these\nintermediate changes, as they aren't relevant anyways.\n\nPotentially fixes
