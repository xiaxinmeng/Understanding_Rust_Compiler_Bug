Modern computers are often multi-core,\n+to the point that even embedded devices like cell phones have more than one\n+processor. Rust's semantics lend themselves very nicely to solving a number of\n+issues that programmers have with concurrency. Many concurrency errors that are\n+runtime errors in other languages are compile-time errors in Rust.\n+\n+Rust's concurrency primitive is called a **task**. Tasks are lightweight, and\n+do not share memory in an unsafe manner, preferring message passing to\n+communicate.  It's worth noting that tasks are implemented as a library, and\n+not part of the language.  This means that in the future, other concurrency\n+libraries can be written for Rust to help in specific scenarios.  Here's an\n+example of creating a task:\n+\n+```{rust}\n+spawn(proc() {\n+    println!(\"Hello from a task!\");\n+});\n+```\n+\n+The `spawn` function takes a proc as an argument, and runs that proc in a new\n+task. A proc takes ownership of its entire environment, and so any variables\n+that you use inside the proc will not be usable afterward:\n+\n+```{rust,ignore}\n+let mut x = vec![1i, 2i, 3i];\n+\n+spawn(proc() {\n+    println!(\"The value of x[0] is: {}\", x[0]);\n+});\n+\n+println!(\"The value of x[0] is: {}\", x[0]); // error: use of moved value: `x`\n+```\n+\n+`x` is now owned by the proc, and so we can't use it anymore. Many other\n+languages would let us do this, but it's not safe to do so. Rust's type system\n+catches the error.\n+\n+If tasks were only able to capture these values, they wouldn't be very useful.\n+Luckily, tasks can communicate with each other through **channel**s. Channels\n+work like this:\n+\n+```{rust}\n+let (tx, rx) = channel();\n+\n+spawn(proc() {\n+    tx.send(\"Hello from a task!\".to_string());\n+});\n+\n+let message = rx.recv();\n+println!(\"{}\", message);\n+```\n+\n+The `channel()` function returns two endpoints: a `Receiver<T>` and a\n+`Sender<T>`. You can use the `.send()` method on the `Sender<T>` end, and\n+receive the message on the `Receiver<T>` side with the `recv()` method.  This\n+method blocks until it gets a message. There's a similar method, `.try_recv()`,\n+which returns an `Option<T>` and does not block.\n+\n+If you want to send messages to the task as well, create two channels!\n+\n+```{rust}\n+let (tx1, rx1) = channel();\n+let (tx2, rx2) = channel();\n+\n+spawn(proc() {\n+    tx1.send(\"Hello from a task!\".to_string());\n+    let message = rx2.recv();\n+    println!(\"{}\", message);\n+});\n+\n+let message = rx1.recv();\n+println!(\"{}\", message);\n+\n+tx2.send(\"Goodbye from main!\".to_string());\n+```\n+\n+The proc has one sending end and one receiving end, and the main task has one\n+of each as well. Now they can talk back and forth in whatever way they wish.\n+\n+Notice as well that because `Sender` and `Receiver` are generic, while you can\n+pass any kind of information through the channel, the ends are strongly typed.\n+If you try to pass a string, and then an integer, Rust will complain.\n+\n+## Futures\n+\n+With these basic primitives, many different concurrency patterns can be\n+developed. Rust includes some of these types in its standard library. For\n+example, if you wish to compute some value in the background, `Future` is\n+a useful thing to use:\n+\n+```{rust}\n+use std::sync::Future;\n+\n+let mut delayed_value = Future::spawn(proc() {\n+    // just return anything for examples' sake\n+\n+    12345i\n+});\n+println!(\"value = {}\", delayed_value.get());\n+```\n+\n+Calling `Future::spawn` works just like `spawn()`: it takes a proc. In this\n+case, though, you don't need to mess with the channel: just have the proc\n+return the value.\n+\n+`Future::spawn` will return a value which we can bind with `let`. It needs\n+to be mutable, because once the value is computed, it saves a copy of the\n+value, and if it were immutable, it couldn't update itself.\n+\n+The proc will go on processing in the background, and when we need the final\n+value, we can call `get()` on it. This will block until the result is done,\n+but if it's finished computing in the background, we'll just get the value\n+immediately.\n+\n+## Success and failure\n+\n+Tasks don't always succeed, they can also fail. A task that wishes to fail\n+can call the `fail!` macro, passing a message:\n+\n+```{rust}\n+spawn(proc() {\n+    fail!(\"Nope.\");\n+});\n+```\n+\n+If a task fails, it is not possible for it to recover. However, it can\n+notify other tasks that it has failed. We can do this with `task::try`:\n+\n+```{rust}\n+use std::task;\n+use std::rand;\n+\n+let result = task::try(proc() {\n+    if rand::random() {\n+        println!(\"OK\");\n+    } else {\n+        fail!(\"oops!\");\n+    }\n+});\n+```\n+\n+This task will randomly fail or succeed. `task::try` returns a `Result`\n+type, so we can handle the response like any other computation that may\n+fail.\n+\n # Macros\n \n # Unsafe"}]}
