A copy of the data to share would then be made for each task. In some cases, this would\n+add up to a significant amount of wasted memory and would require copying the same data more than\n+necessary.\n+\n+To tackle this issue, one can use an Atomically Reference Counted wrapper (`ARC`) as implemented in\n+the `extra` library of Rust.
