If you\n found a bug with Miri, we'd appreciate if you tell us and we'll add it to the\n list!\n \n+Be aware that Miri will not catch all possible errors in your program, and\n+cannot run all programs:\n+\n+* There are still plenty of open questions around the basic invariants for some\n+  types and when these invariants even have to hold, so if you program runs fine\n+  in Miri right now that is by no means a guarantee that it is UB-free when\n+  these questions get answered.\n+* If the program relies on unspecified details of how data is laid out, it will\n+  still run fine in Miri -- but might break (including causing UB) on different\n+  compiler versions or different platforms.\n+* Miri is fully deterministic and does not actually pick a base address in\n+  virtual memory for the program's allocations.  If program behavior depends on\n+  the base address of an allocation, Miri will stop execution (with a few\n+  exceptions to make some common pointer comparisons work).\n+* Miri runs the program as a platform-independent interpreter, so the program\n+  has no access to any platform-specific APIs or FFI. A few APIs have been\n+  implemented (such as printing to stdout) but most have not: for example, Miri\n+  currently does not support concurrency, or networking, or file system access,\n+  or gathering entropy from the system.\n+\n [rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/\n [mir]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1211-mir.md\n [`unreachable_unchecked`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hint/fn.unreachable_unchecked.html"}]}
