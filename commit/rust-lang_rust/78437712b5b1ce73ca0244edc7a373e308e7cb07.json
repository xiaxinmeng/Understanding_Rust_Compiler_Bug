Especially if you look at the screen late at night you can notice it. I thought I should change that so I added a black outline around the emoji. It works using the [`text-shadow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow) property. It may be a bit hacky but it seems to work well and browser compatibility looks pretty good too: [browser compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow#browser_compatibility).\nFor consistency the microscope has the black border too.\nAlternatively I had `drop-shadow(0px 0px 1px black);` in mind but its [browser compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/drop-shadow()#browser_compatibility) doesn't look as good and the blurry shadow probably doesn't look as good either.\n\nThen, I thought that now that I'm at it I could also try changing the purple color to a color you would rather expect to see for deprecation: red. For the red I've taken the blue and reused it as a foundation and moved it to the red color spectrum.\nBut then I thought that the purple color could still be reused for something else: for the boxes that tell you about portability (e.g. _only supported on Unix_). These are currently blue.\n\nI think blue doesn't really represent danger like it should. Not being cross-platform represents a danger because if you want to compile for a different platform, your code may not compile anymore. Blue looks too friendly and is in my opinion more suitable for a box containing general information like for instance \"This is available since 1.0.0\". None of the current three box types (unstable, deprecated and portability) are that.\n\nI think purple is a better fit for it because it's kind of in the middle between \"use it\" and \"don't use it\". Deprecated is definitely \"don't use it\". To illustrate this better, here's a color spectrum:\n\nBlue = friendly,  \"use it\".\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35064754/112139891-9a6b0f80-8bd3-11eb-94e1-dc747a3d4cf9.png)\nRed = danger, \"don't use it\".\n\nAnd the purple in the middle (the color that the portability box now has) probably represents \"use it if you have to\", so it's not entirely friendly and not entirely a danger. That is why I think it fits.\n\nHowever I made one change to that existing purple: I made the outer color a bit brighter because it's outstandingly dark compared to the other outer colors of the other boxes.\n\nThis is all subjective but in my opinion it looks nicer. At first you might need to get used to it though.
