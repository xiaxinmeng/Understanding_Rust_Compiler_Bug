There are many ways to\n+contribute, and we appreciate all of them. This document is a bit long, so here's\n+links to the major sections:\n \n-http://doc.rust-lang.org/complement-bugreport.html\n+* [Feature Requests](#feature-requests)\n+* [Bug Reports](#bug-reports)\n+* [Pull Requests](#pull-requests)\n+* [Writing Documentation](#writing-documentation)\n+* [Issue Triage](#issue-triage)\n+* [Out-of-tree Contributions](#out-of-tree-contributions)\n \n-## Submitting an issue\n+If you have questions, please make a post on [internals.rust-lang.org][internals] or\n+hop on [#rust-internals][pound-rust-internals].\n \n-Please submit issues here for bug reports or implementation details. For feature\n-requests, language changes, or major changes to the libraries, please submit an\n-issue against the [RFCs repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).\n+As a reminder, all contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](coc).\n \n-## Pull request procedure\n+[pound-rust-internals]: http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust-internals\n+[internals]: http://internals.rust-lang.org\n+[coc]: http://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html\n \n-Pull requests should be targeted at Rust's `master` branch.\n-Before pushing to your Github repo and issuing the pull request,\n-please do two things:\n+## Feature Requests\n \n-1. [Rebase](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) your\n-   local changes against the `master` branch. Resolve any conflicts\n-   that arise.\n+To request a change to the way that the Rust language works, please open an\n+issue in the [RFCs repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/new)\n+rather than this one. New features and other significant language changes\n+must go through the RFC process.\n \n-2. Run the full Rust test suite with the `make check` command.  You're\n-   not off the hook even if you just stick to documentation; code\n-   examples in the docs are tested as well! Although for simple\n-   wording or grammar fixes, this is probably unnecessary.\n+## Bug Reports\n \n-Pull requests will be treated as \"review requests\", and we will give\n-feedback we expect to see corrected on\n-[style](http://aturon.github.io/) and\n-substance before pulling.  Changes contributed via pull request should\n-focus on a single issue at a time, like any other.  We will not accept\n-pull-requests that try to \"sneak\" unrelated changes in.\n+While bugs are unfortunate, they're a reality in software. We can't fix what we\n+don't know about, so please report liberally. If you're not sure if something\n+is a bug or not, feel free to file a bug anyway.\n \n-Normally, all pull requests must include regression tests (see\n-[Note-testsuite](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/wiki/Note-testsuite))\n-that test your change.  Occasionally, a change will be very difficult\n-to test for.  In those cases, please include a note in your commit\n-message explaining why.\n+If you have the chance, before reporting a bug, please [search existing\n+issues](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/search?q=&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93),\n+as it's possible that someone else has already reported your error. This doesn't\n+always work, and sometimes it's hard to know what to search for, so consider this\n+extra credit. We won't mind if you accidentally file a duplicate report.\n \n-In the licensing header at the beginning of any files you change,\n-please make sure the listed date range includes the current year.  For\n-example, if it's 2014, and you change a Rust file that was created in\n-2010, it should begin:\n+Opening an issue is as easy as following [this\n+link](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/new) and filling out the fields.\n+Here's a template that you can use to file a bug, though it's not necessary to\n+use it exactly:\n \n-```\n-// Copyright 2010-2014 The Rust Project Developers.\n+    <short summary of the bug>\n+\n+    I tried this code:\n+\n+    <code sample that causes the bug>\n+\n+    I expected to see this happen: <explanation>\n+\n+    Instead, this happened: <explanation>\n+\n+    ## Meta\n+\n+    `rustc --version --verbose`:\n+\n+    Backtrace:\n+\n+All three components are important: what you did, what you expected, what\n+happened instead. Please include the output of `rustc --version --verbose`,\n+which includes important information about what platform you're on, what\n+version of Rust you're using, etc.\n+\n+Sometimes, a backtrace is helpful, and so including that is nice. To get\n+a backtrace, set the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable. The easiest way\n+to do this is to invoke `rustc` like this:\n+\n+```bash\n+$ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 rustc ...\n ```\n \n-# Coordination and communication\n+## Pull Requests\n \n-Get feedback from other developers on\n-[internals.rust-lang.org][internals], and\n-[#rust-internals][pound-rust-internals].\n+Pull requests are the primary mechanism we use to change Rust. GitHub itself\n+has some [great documentation][pull-requests] on using the Pull Request\n+feature. We use the 'fork and pull' model described there.\n \n-[pound-rust-internals]: http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust-internals\n-[internals]: http://internals.rust-lang.org\n+[pull-requests]: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/\n+\n+Please make pull requests against the `master` branch.\n+\n+All pull requests are reviewed by another person. We have a bot,\n+@rust-highfive, that will automatically assign a random person to review your request.\n+\n+If you want to request that a specific person reviews your pull request,\n+you can add an `r?` to the message. For example, Steve usually reviews\n+documentation changes. So if you were to make a documentation change, add\n+\n+    r? @steveklabnik\n+\n+to the end of the message, and @rust-highfive will assign @steveklabnik instead\n+of a random person. This is entirely optional.\n+\n+After someone has reviewed your pull request, they will leave an annotation\n+on the pull request with an `r+`. It will look something like this:\n+\n+    @bors: r+ 38fe8d2\n+\n+This tells @bors, our lovable integration bot, that your pull request has\n+been approved. The PR then enters the [merge queue][merge-queue], where @bors\n+will run all the tests on every platform we support. If it all works out,\n+@bors will merge your code into `master` and close the pull request.\n+\n+[merge-queue]: http://buildbot.rust-lang.org/homu/queue/rust\n+\n+## Writing Documentation\n+\n+Documentation improvements are very welcome. The source of `doc.rust-lang.org`\n+is located in `src/doc` in the tree, and standard API documentation is generated\n+from the source code itself.\n+\n+Documentation pull requests function in the same as other pull requests, though\n+you may see a slightly different form of `r+`:\n+\n+    @bors: r+ 38fe8d2 rollup\n+\n+That additional `rollup` tells @bors that this change is eligible for a 'rollup'.\n+To save @bors some work, and to get small changes through more quickly, when\n+@bors attempts to merge a commit that's rollup-eligible, it will also merge\n+the other rollup-eligible patches too, and they'll get tested and merged at\n+the same time.\n+\n+## Issue Triage\n+\n+Sometimes, an issue will stay open, even though the bug has been fixed. And\n+sometimes, the original bug may go stale because something has changed in the\n+meantime.\n+\n+It can be helpful to go through older bug reports and make sure that they are\n+still valid. Load up an older issue, double check that it's still true, and\n+leave a comment letting us know if it is or is not. The [least recently updated sort][lru] is good for finding issues like this.\n+\n+[lru]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc\n+\n+## Out-of-tree Contributions\n+\n+There are a number of other ways to contribute to Rust that don't deal with\n+this repository.\n+\n+Answer questions in [#rust][pound-rust], or on [users.rust-lang.org][users],\n+or on [StackOverflow][so].\n+\n+Participate in the [RFC process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).\n+\n+Find a [requested community library][community-library], build it, and publish\n+it to [Crates.io](http://crates.io).

It's also possible that\n-your code is not well-typed, but if you saw this message, it's still a bug in\n-error reporting.\n-\n-If you see a message about an LLVM assertion failure, then you have also\n-definitely found a bug in the compiler. In both of these cases, it's not your\n-fault and you should report a bug!\n-\n-If you see a compiler error message that you think is meant for users to see,\n-but it confuses you, *that's a bug too*. If it wasn't clear to you, then it's\n-an error message we want to improve, so please report it so that we can try\n-to make it better.\n-\n-# How do I know the bug I found isn't a bug that already exists in the issue tracker?\n-\n-If you don't have enough time for a search, then don't worry about that. Just submit\n-the bug. If it's a duplicate, somebody will notice that and close it during triage.\n-\n-If you have the time for it, it would be useful to type the text of the error\n-message you got [into the issue tracker search box](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues)\n-to see if there's an existing bug that resembles your problem. If there is,\n-and it's an open bug, you can comment on that issue and say you are also affected.\n-This will encourage the devs to fix it. But again, don't let this stop you from\n-submitting a bug. We'd rather have to do the work of closing duplicates than\n-miss out on valid bug reports.\n-\n-# What information should I include in a bug report?\n-\n-It generally helps our diagnosis to include your specific OS (for example: Mac OS X 10.8.3,\n-Windows 7, Ubuntu 12.04) and your hardware architecture (for example: i686, x86_64).\n-It's also helpful to provide the exact version and host by copying the output of\n-re-running the erroneous rustc command with the `--version --verbose` flags, which will\n-produce something like this:\n-\n-```text\n-rustc 0.12.0 (ba4081a5a 2014-10-07 13:44:41 -0700)\n-binary: rustc\n-commit-hash: ba4081a5a8573875fed17545846f6f6902c8ba8d\n-commit-date: 2014-10-07 13:44:41 -0700\n-host: i686-apple-darwin\n-release: 0.12.0\n-```\n-\n-Finally, if you can also provide a backtrace, that'd be great. You can get a\n-backtrace by setting the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable to `1`, like\n-this: \n-\n-```bash\n-$ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 rustc ...\n-```\n-\n-# I submitted a bug, but nobody has commented on it!\n-\n-This is sad, but does happen sometimes, since we're short-staffed.
