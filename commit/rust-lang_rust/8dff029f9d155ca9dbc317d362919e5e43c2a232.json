This means that development on the standard library should\n+      be speeder due to smaller crates, as well as a clearer line between\n+      all dependencies.\n+    * A new library, libcore, lives under the standard library's facade\n+      which is Rust's \"0-assumption\" library, suitable for embedded and\n+      kernel development for example.\n+    * A regex crate has been added to the standard distribution.

This allows connecting to a hostname as\n+      opposed to an IP.\n+    * The Reader trait now contains a core method, read_at_least(), which\n+      correctly handles many repeated 0-length reads.\n+    * The process-spawning API is now centered around a builder-style\n+      Command struct.\n+    * The :? printing qualifier has been moved from the standard library to\n+      an external libdebug crate.\n+    * Eq/Ord have been renamed to PartialEq/PartialOrd.
