It is\n- numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n-\n-\t\t\t    Preamble\n-\n-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n-\n-  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\n-specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\n-other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\n-your libraries, too.\n-\n-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n-\n-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\n-you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n-\n-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n-code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\n-complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\n-with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\n-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\n-the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\n-permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n-\n-  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\n-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n-library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\n-version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\n-the original authors' reputations.\n-\f\n-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\n-software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\n-transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\n-we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\n-free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\n-GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\n-license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\n-designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\n-one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\n-the same as in the ordinary license.\n-\n-  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\n-they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\n-program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\n-changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\n-analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\n-a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\n-derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\n-treats it as such.\n-\n-  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\n-Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\n-sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\n-concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n-\n-  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\n-users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\n-libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\n-permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\n-preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\n-libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\n-this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\n-changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\n-will lead to faster development of free libraries.\n-\n-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n-\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n-former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\n-works together with the library.\n-\n-  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\n-General Public License rather than by this special one.\n-\f\n-\t\t  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\n-contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\n-party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\n-General Public License (also called \"this License\").  Each licensee is\n-addressed as \"you\".\n-\n-  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\n-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n-\n-  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\n-which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\n-Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\n-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n-included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n-\n-  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\n-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\n-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\n-and installation of the library.\n-\n-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\n-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\n-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\n-and what the program that uses the Library does.\n-  \n-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\n-Library.\n-\n-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n-fee.\n-\f\n-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n-\n-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n-\n-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n-    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n-    its purpose remains meaningful.\n-\n-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n-    root function must still compute square roots.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\n-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n-it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-collective works based on the Library.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\n-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\n-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n-the scope of this License.\n-\n-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\n-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\n-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\n-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\n-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\n-these notices.\n-\f\n-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\n-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n-\n-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n-the Library into a program that is not a library.\n-\n-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\n-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n-medium customarily used for software interchange.\n-\n-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\n-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\n-linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\n-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\n-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n-\n-  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n-contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\n-library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\n-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n-\n-  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\n-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\n-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n-\n-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\n-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\n-Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n-\n-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\n-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n-\f\n-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\n-link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\n-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n-engineering for debugging such modifications.\n-\n-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\n-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\n-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\n-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n-of these things:\n-\n-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n-    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n-    to use the modified definitions.)\n-\n-    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n-    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n-    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n-\n-    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n-    specified materials from the same place.\n-\n-    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n-\n-  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\n-Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\n-the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\n-distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n-the executable.\n-\n-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\n-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\n-distribute.\n-\f\n-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\n-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\n-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\n-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\n-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n-\n-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n-    Sections above.\n-\n-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n-\n-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\n-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\n-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\n-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Library or works based on it.\n-\n-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\n-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n-this License.\n-\f\n-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\n-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\n-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n-impose that choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n-be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\n-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\n-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\n-written in the body of this License.\n-\n-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n-versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\n-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n-\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\n-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.\n-\f\n-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\n-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\n-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n-and reuse of software generally.\n-\n-\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n-\n-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\n-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n-AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\n-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\n-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n-DAMAGES.\n-\n-\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\f\n-     Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n-\n-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\n-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\n-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\n-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\n-ordinary General Public License).\n-\n-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\n-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n-\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n-\n-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\n-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n-    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n-\n-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
