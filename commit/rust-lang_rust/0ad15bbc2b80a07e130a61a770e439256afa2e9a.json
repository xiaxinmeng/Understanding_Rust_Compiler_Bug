Rust project uses a concept called \u2018release channels\u2019 to manage releases.\n+It\u2019s important to understand this process to choose which version of Rust\n+your project should use.\n+\n+# Overview\n+\n+There are three channels for Rust releases:\n+\n+* Nightly\n+* Beta\n+* Stable\n+\n+New nightly releases are created once a day. Every six weeks, the latest\n+nightly release is promoted to \u2018Beta\u2019. At that point, it will only receive\n+patches to fix serious errors. Six weeks later, the beta is promoted to\n+\u2018Stable\u2019, and becomes the next release of `1.x`.\n+\n+This process happens in parallel. So every six weeks, on the same day,\n+nightly goes to beta, beta goes to stable. When `1.x` is released, at\n+the same time, `1.(x + 1)-beta` is released, and the nightly becomes the\n+first version of `1.(x + 2)-nightly`.\n+\n+# Choosing a version\n+\n+Generally speaking, unless you have a specific reason, you should be using the\n+stable release channel. These releases are intended for a general audience.\n+\n+However, depending on your interest in Rust, you may choose to use nightly\n+instead. The basic tradeoff is this: in the nightly channel, you can use\n+unstable, new Rust features. However, unstable features are subject to change,\n+and so any new nightly release may break your code. If you use the stable\n+release, you cannot use experimental features, but the next release of Rust\n+will not cause significant issues through breaking changes.\n+\n+# Helping the ecosystem through CI\n+\n+What about beta? We encourage all Rust users who use the stable release channel\n+to also test against the beta channel in their continuous integration systems.\n+This will help alert the team in case there\u2019s an accidental regression.\n+\n+Additionally, testing against nightly can catch regressions even sooner, and so\n+if you don\u2019t mind a third build, we\u2019d appreciate testing against all channels.\n+"}]}
