The project group has a long-term plan for how\nto get around this kind of issue and move the associated functions into\nlibcore, but that will likely take time as well. Since all routes\nforward are temporally costly, we probably will skip the lang item\napproach entirely and go the \"proper\" route, but in the interests of\nhaving something this year for people to play around with, this\nextension trait was whipped up.\n\nFor now, while it involves a lot of fairly internal details most users\nshouldn't have to care about, I went ahead and fully documented the\nsituation for any passerby to read on the trait, as the situation is\nquite unusual and puzzling to begin with.", "tree": {"sha": "9373069a4b33c683abe83baf083ee8663620e437", "url":
