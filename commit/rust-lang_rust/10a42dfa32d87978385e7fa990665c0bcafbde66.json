Publishing and running a Fuchsia package to a Fuchsia emulator.\n+\n+For the purposes of this walkthrough, we will only target `x86_64-fuchsia`.\n+\n+## Compiling a Rust binary targeting Fuchsia\n+\n+Today, there are two main ways to build a Rust binary targeting Fuchsia\n+using the Fuchsia SDK:\n+1. Allow [rustup] to handle the installation of Fuchsia targets for you.\n+1. Build a toolchain locally that can target Fuchsia.\n+\n+### Targeting Fuchsia with rustup and cargo\n+\n+The easiest way to build a Rust binary targeting Fuchsia is by allowing [rustup]\n+to handle the installation of Fuchsia targets for you.
