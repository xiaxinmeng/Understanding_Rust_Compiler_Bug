Programs cannot rely on `black_box` for *correctness* in any way.\n ///\n /// [`std::convert::identity`]: crate::convert::identity\n+///\n+/// # When is this useful?\n+///\n+/// First and foremost: `black_box` does _not_ guarantee any exact behavior and, in some cases, may\n+/// do nothing at all. As such, it **must not be relied upon to control critical program behavior.**\n+/// This _immediately_ precludes any direct use of this function for cryptographic or security\n+/// purposes.\n+///\n+/// While not suitable in those mission-critical cases, `back_box`'s functionality can generally be\n+/// relied upon for benchmarking, and should be used there. It will try to ensure that the\n+/// compiler doesn't optimize away part of the intended test code based on context. For\n+/// example:\n+///\n+/// ```\n+/// fn contains(haystack: &[&str], needle: &str) -> bool {\n+///     haystack.iter().any(|x| x == &needle)\n+/// }\n+///\n+/// pub fn benchmark() {\n+///     let haystack = vec![\"abc\", \"def\", \"ghi\", \"jkl\", \"mno\"];\n+///     let needle = \"ghi\";\n+///     for _ in 0..10 {\n+///         contains(&haystack, needle);\n+///     }\n+/// }\n+/// ```\n+///\n+/// The compiler could theoretically make optimizations like the following:\n+///\n+/// - `needle` and `haystack` are always the same, move the call to `contains` outside the loop and\n+///   delete the loop\n+/// - Inline `contains`\n+/// - `needle` and `haystack` have values known at compile time, `contains` is always true. Remove\n+///   the call and replace with `true`\n+/// - Nothing is done with the result of `contains`: delete this function call entirely\n+/// - `benchmark` now has no purpose: delete this function\n+///\n+/// It is not likely that all of the above happens, but the compiler is definitely able to make some\n+/// optimizations that could result in a very inaccurate benchmark. This is where `black_box` comes\n+/// in:\n+///\n+/// ```\n+/// use std::hint::black_box;\n+///\n+/// // Same `contains` function\n+/// fn contains(haystack: &[&str], needle: &str) -> bool {\n+///     haystack.iter().any(|x| x == &needle)\n+/// }\n+///\n+/// pub fn benchmark() {\n+///     let haystack = vec![\"abc\", \"def\", \"ghi\", \"jkl\", \"mno\"];\n+///     let needle = \"ghi\";\n+///     for _ in 0..10 {\n+///         // Adjust our benchmark loop contents\n+///         black_box(contains(black_box(&haystack), black_box(needle)));\n+///     }\n+/// }\n+/// ```\n+///\n+/// This essentially tells the compiler to block optimizations across any calls to `black_box`. So,\n+/// it now:\n+///\n+/// - Treats both arguments to `contains` as unpredictable: the body of `contains` can no longer be\n+///   optimized based on argument values\n+/// - Treats the call to `contains` and its result as volatile: the body of `benchmark` cannot\n+///   optimize this away\n+///\n+/// This makes our benchmark much more realistic to how the function would be used in situ, where\n+/// arguments are usually not known at compile time and the result is used in some way.\n #[inline]\n #[stable(feature = \"bench_black_box\", since = \"1.66.0\")]\n #[rustc_const_unstable(feature = \"const_black_box\", issue = \"none\")]"}]}
