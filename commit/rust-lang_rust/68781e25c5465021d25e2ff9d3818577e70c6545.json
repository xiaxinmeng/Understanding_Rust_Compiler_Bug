If this is your first time, the documentation for the standard\n+//! library is written to be casually perused and clicking on\n+//! interesting things should generally lead you to interesting\n+//! places. Still, there are important bits you don't want to miss, so\n+//! read on for a tour of the standard library and its documentation.\n+//!\n+//! Once you are familiar with the contents of the standard library\n+//! you may begin to find the verbosity of the prose distracting. At\n+//! this stage in your development you may want to press the **[-]**\n+//! button near the top of the page to collapse it into a more\n+//! skimmable view.\n+//!\n+//! While you are looking at that **[-]** button also notice the\n+//! **[src]** button. Rust's API documentation comes with the source\n+//! code and you are encouraged to read it. The standard library\n+//! source is generally high quality and a peek behind the curtains is\n+//! often enlightening.\n+//!\n+//! # What is in the standard library documentation?\n //!\n-//! ## What is in the standard library\n+//! Lots of stuff. Well, broadly four things actually.\n //!\n-//! The standard library is a set of minimal, battle-tested\n-//! core types and shared abstractions for the [broader Rust\n-//! ecosystem](https://crates.io) to build on.\n+//! First of all, The Rust Standard Library is divided into a number\n+//! of focused modules, [all listed further down this page](#modules).\n+//! These modules are the bedrock upon which all of Rust is forged,\n+//! and they have mighty names like [`std::slice`](slice/index.html)\n+//! and [`std::cmp`](cmp/index.html). Modules' documentation typically\n+//! includes an overview of the module along with examples, and are\n+//! a smart place to start familiarizing yourself with the library.\n //!\n-//! The [primitive types](#primitives), though not defined in the\n-//! standard library, are documented here, as are the predefined\n-//! [macros](#macros).\n+//! Secondly, implicit methods on [primitive\n+//! types](../book/primitive-types.html) are documented here. This can\n+//! be a source of confusion for two reasons:\n+//!\n+//! 1. While primitives are implemented by the compiler, the standard\n+//!    library implements methods directly on the primitive types (and\n+//!    it is the only library that does so), which are [documented in\n+//!    the section on primitives](#primitives).\n+//! 2. The standard library exports many modules *with the same name\n+//!    as primitive types*. These define additional items related\n+//!    to the primitive type, but not the all-important methods.\n+//!\n+//! So for example there is a [page for the primitive type\n+//! `i32`](primitive.i32.html) that lists all the methods that can be\n+//! called on 32-bit integers (mega useful), and there is a [page for\n+//! the module `std::i32`](i32/index.html) that documents the constant\n+//! values `MIN` and `MAX` (rarely useful).\n+//!\n+//! Note the documentation for the primitives\n+//! [`str`](primitive.str.html) and [`[T]`](primitive.slice.html)\n+//! (also called 'slice'). Many method calls on\n+//! [`String`](string/struct.String.html) and\n+//! [`Vec`](vec/struct.Vec.html) are actually calls to methods on\n+//! `str` and `[T]` respectively, via [deref\n+//! coercions](../book/deref-coercions.html). *Accepting that\n+//! primitive types are documented on their own pages will bring you a\n+//! deep inner wisdom. Embrace it now before proceeding.*\n+//!\n+//! Thirdly, the standard library defines [The Rust\n+//! Prelude](prelude/index.html), a small collection of items - mostly\n+//! traits - that are imported into every module. The traits in the\n+//! prelude are pervasive, making the prelude documentation a good\n+//! entry point to learning about the library.\n+//!\n+//! And lastly, the standard library exports a number of standard\n+//! macros, and [lists them on this page](#macros) (technically, not\n+//! all of the standard macros are defined by the standard library -\n+//! some are defined by the compiler - but they are documented here\n+//! the same).  Like the prelude, the standard macros are imported by\n+//! default into all crates.\n+//!\n+//! # A Tour of The Rust Standard Library\n+//!\n+//!
