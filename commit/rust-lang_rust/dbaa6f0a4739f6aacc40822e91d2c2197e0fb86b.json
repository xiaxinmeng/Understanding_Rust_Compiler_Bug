This has been a problem for us because we sometimes hit a bors timeout if there\nare too many builds queued up.\n\nTo improve the situation, I think we could try to use AppVeyor a bit less\noften. The average PR is not going to break windows related things anyway, so\nit should be fine to run it on r+/try/master only.\n\nchangelog: none", "tree": {"sha": "820df51f70ccaae96924a266dc9b3bc2cd1317d3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/820df51f70ccaae96924a266dc9b3bc2cd1317d3"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/dbaa6f0a4739f6aacc40822e91d2c2197e0fb86b", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/dbaa6f0a4739f6aacc40822e91d2c2197e0fb86b", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/dbaa6f0a4739f6aacc40822e91d2c2197e0fb86b", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/dbaa6f0a4739f6aacc40822e91d2c2197e0fb86b/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "d84d3f8c6668396b1d2f28d5de55fb14484b493f", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/d84d3f8c6668396b1d2f28d5de55fb14484b493f", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/d84d3f8c6668396b1d2f28d5de55fb14484b493f"}, {"sha": "8d7a5fe126983e82caaf20be47841329131f15fa", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/8d7a5fe126983e82caaf20be47841329131f15fa", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/8d7a5fe126983e82caaf20be47841329131f15fa"}], "stats": {"total": 10, "additions": 5, "deletions": 5}, "files": [{"sha": "2d8704a703bcd6655e7fb2c30215d1306dfec939", "filename": "appveyor.yml", "status": "modified", "additions": 5, "deletions": 5, "changes": 10, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/dbaa6f0a4739f6aacc40822e91d2c2197e0fb86b/appveyor.yml", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/dbaa6f0a4739f6aacc40822e91d2c2197e0fb86b/appveyor.yml", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/appveyor.yml?ref=dbaa6f0a4739f6aacc40822e91d2c2197e0fb86b", "patch": "@@ -8,11 +8,11 @@ environment:\n         - TARGET: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\n \n branches:\n-    # Don't build these branches\n-    except:\n-        # Used by bors\n-        - trying.tmp\n-        - staging.tmp\n+    # Only build AppVeyor on r+, try and the master branch\n+    only:\n+      - auto\n+      - try\n+      - master\n \n install:\n     - curl -sSf -o rustup-init.exe https://win.rustup.rs/"}]}
