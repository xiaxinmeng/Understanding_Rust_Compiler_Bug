PUBLIC LICENSE\n+\t\t       Version 2, June 1991\n+\n+ Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n+ 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA\n+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n+\n+[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is\n+ numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n+\n+\t\t\t    Preamble\n+\n+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n+Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n+free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n+\n+  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\n+specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\n+other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\n+your libraries, too.\n+\n+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n+\n+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\n+you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n+\n+  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n+or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n+you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n+code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\n+complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\n+with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\n+it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n+\n+  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\n+the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\n+permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n+\n+  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\n+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n+library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\n+version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\n+the original authors' reputations.\n+\f\n+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\n+software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\n+transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\n+we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\n+free use or not licensed at all.\n+\n+  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\n+GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\n+license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\n+designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\n+one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\n+the same as in the ordinary license.\n+\n+  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\n+they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\n+program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\n+changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\n+analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\n+a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\n+derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\n+treats it as such.\n+\n+  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\n+Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\n+sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\n+concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n+\n+  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\n+users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\n+libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\n+permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\n+preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\n+libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\n+this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\n+changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\n+will lead to faster development of free libraries.\n+\n+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n+modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n+\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n+former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\n+works together with the library.\n+\n+  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\n+General Public License rather than by this special one.\n+\f\n+\t\t  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n+\n+  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\n+contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\n+party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\n+General Public License (also called \"this License\").  Each licensee is\n+addressed as \"you\".\n+\n+  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\n+prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n+(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n+\n+  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\n+which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\n+Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n+copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n+portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\n+straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n+included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n+\n+  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n+making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\n+all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\n+interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\n+and installation of the library.\n+\n+  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n+running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n+such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\n+on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\n+writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\n+and what the program that uses the Library does.\n+  \n+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n+complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n+you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n+appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n+all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n+warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\n+Library.\n+\n+  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n+and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n+fee.\n+\f\n+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n+of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n+\n+    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n+\n+    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n+\n+    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n+    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n+\n+    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n+    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n+    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n+    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n+    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n+    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n+    its purpose remains meaningful.\n+\n+    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n+    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n+    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n+    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n+    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n+    root function must still compute square roots.)\n+\n+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\n+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n+on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n+it.\n+\n+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n+collective works based on the Library.\n+\n+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\n+with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\n+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n+the scope of this License.\n+\n+  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n+License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n+this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\n+that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\n+instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\n+ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\n+that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\n+these notices.\n+\f\n+  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n+that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\n+subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n+\n+  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n+the Library into a program that is not a library.\n+\n+  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n+derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\n+under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n+it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n+must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n+medium customarily used for software interchange.\n+\n+  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\n+source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n+distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n+\n+  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n+Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\n+linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\n+work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\n+therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n+\n+  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n+creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n+contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\n+library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\n+Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n+\n+  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\n+that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\n+derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n+Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n+linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n+threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n+\n+  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n+structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n+functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n+file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\n+work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\n+Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n+\n+  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n+distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\n+Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n+whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n+\f\n+  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\n+link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\n+work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n+under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n+modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n+engineering for debugging such modifications.\n+\n+  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\n+Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\n+this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\n+during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n+copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n+directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n+of these things:\n+\n+    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n+    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n+    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n+    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n+    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n+    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n+    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n+    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n+    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n+    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n+    to use the modified definitions.)\n+\n+    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n+    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n+    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n+    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n+\n+    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n+    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n+    specified materials from the same place.\n+\n+    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n+    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n+\n+  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\n+Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n+reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\n+the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\n+distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n+the executable.\n+\n+  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n+restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n+accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\n+use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\n+distribute.\n+\f\n+  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n+Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\n+facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\n+library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\n+the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\n+permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n+\n+    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n+    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n+    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n+    Sections above.\n+\n+    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n+    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n+    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n+\n+  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\n+the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n+attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n+distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\n+rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\n+or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n+terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n+\n+  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n+distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n+modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\n+Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n+the Library or works based on it.\n+\n+  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n+Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n+original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\n+subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n+this License.\n+\f\n+  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n+may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\n+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\n+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n+refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n+\n+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n+and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n+\n+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n+integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n+impose that choice.\n+\n+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n+be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n+\n+  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\n+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n+original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\n+an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n+so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n+excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\n+written in the body of this License.\n+\n+  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n+versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\n+Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n+but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n+\n+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n+\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n+the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\n+license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\n+the Free Software Foundation.\n+\f\n+  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n+programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\n+write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n+copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n+Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n+decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\n+of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n+and reuse of software generally.\n+\n+\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n+\n+  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n+WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\n+OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n+KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n+IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n+LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n+THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n+\n+  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n+WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n+AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n+FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n+LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\n+RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n+FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\n+SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n+DAMAGES.\n+\n+\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\f\n+     Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n+\n+  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\n+possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\n+everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\n+redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\n+ordinary General Public License).\n+\n+  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\n+safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n+\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n+\n+    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n+\n+    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n+    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\n+    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n+    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n+\n+    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

By contrast,\n+the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n+share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n+software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n+GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n+any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\n+your programs, too.\n+\n+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n+them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n+want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n+free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n+\n+  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n+these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n+certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n+you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n+\n+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n+gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n+freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\n+or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\n+know their rights.\n+\n+  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n+(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n+giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n+\n+  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n+that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n+authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n+changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n+authors of previous versions.\n+\n+  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n+modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n+can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n+protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\n+pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n+use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\n+have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n+products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n+stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n+of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n+\n+  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n+States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n+software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n+avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n+make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\n+patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n+\n+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n+modification follow.\n+\n+                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+  0. Definitions.\n+\n+  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n+\n+  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\n+works, such as semiconductor masks.\n+\n+  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n+License.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n+\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n+\n+  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n+in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\n+exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\n+earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n+\n+  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\n+on the Program.\n+\n+  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\n+permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n+infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\n+computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\n+distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\n+public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n+\n+  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n+parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\n+a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n+\n+  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\n+to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n+feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n+tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\n+extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\n+work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\n+the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n+menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n+\n+  1. Source Code.\n+\n+  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\n+for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\n+form of a work.\n+\n+  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\n+standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n+interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\n+is widely used among developers working in that language.\n+\n+  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\n+than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n+packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n+Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n+Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n+implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n+\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n+(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n+(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n+produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n+\n+  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\n+the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n+work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\n+control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\n+System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\n+programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\n+which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\n+includes interface definition files associated with source files for\n+the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\n+linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\n+such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\n+subprograms and other parts of the work.\n+\n+  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\n+can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\n+Source.\n+\n+  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\n+same work.\n+\n+  2. Basic Permissions.\n+\n+  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n+copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n+conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n+permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\n+covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n+content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\n+rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n+\n+  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n+convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\n+in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n+of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\n+with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n+the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\n+not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\n+for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n+and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\n+your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n+\n+  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n+the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n+makes it unnecessary.\n+\n+  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n+\n+  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n+measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n+11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\n+similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\n+measures.\n+\n+  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n+circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\n+is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\n+the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\n+modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\n+users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n+technological measures.\n+\n+  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n+\n+  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n+receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n+appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n+keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\n+non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\n+keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\n+recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n+\n+  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\n+and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n+\n+  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n+\n+  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\n+produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\n+terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n+\n+    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n+    it, and giving a relevant date.\n+\n+    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n+    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n+    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n+    \"keep intact all notices\".\n+\n+    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n+    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n+    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n+    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n+    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n+    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n+    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n+\n+    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n+    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n+    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n+    work need not make them do so.\n+\n+  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n+works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\n+and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\n+in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n+\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\n+used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n+beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\n+in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\n+parts of the aggregate.\n+\n+  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n+\n+  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\n+of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\n+machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\n+in one of these ways:\n+\n+    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n+    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n+    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n+    customarily used for software interchange.\n+\n+    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n+    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n+    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n+    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n+    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n+    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n+    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n+    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n+    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n+    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n+    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n+\n+    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n+    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n+    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n+    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n+    with subsection 6b.\n+\n+    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n+    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n+    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n+    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n+    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n+    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n+    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n+    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n+    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n+    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n+    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n+    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n+\n+    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n+    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n+    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n+    charge under subsection 6d.\n+\n+  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\n+from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\n+included in conveying the object code work.\n+\n+  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\n+tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\n+or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\n+into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\n+doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\n+product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\n+typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\n+of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\n+actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\n+is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n+commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n+the only significant mode of use of the product.\n+\n+  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\n+procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\n+and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\n+a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\n+suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\n+code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\n+modification has been made.\n+\n+  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\n+specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\n+part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\n+User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\n+fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\n+Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\n+by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\n+if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\n+modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\n+been installed in ROM).\n+\n+  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\n+requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\n+for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\n+the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\n+network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\n+adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\n+protocols for communication across the network.\n+\n+  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\n+in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\n+documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\n+source code form), and must require no special password or key for\n+unpacking, reading or copying.\n+\n+  7. Additional Terms.\n+\n+  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\n+License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n+Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\n+be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\n+that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\n+apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\n+under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n+this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n+\n+  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n+remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\n+it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n+removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\n+additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n+for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n+\n+  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n+add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\n+that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n+\n+    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n+    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n+\n+    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n+    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n+    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n+\n+    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n+    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n+    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n+\n+    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n+    authors of the material; or\n+\n+    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n+    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n+\n+    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n+    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n+    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n+    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n+    those licensors and authors.\n+\n+  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\n+restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\n+received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\n+governed by this License along with a term that is a further\n+restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\n+a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n+License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\n+of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\n+not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n+\n+  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\n+must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\n+additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n+where to find the applicable terms.\n+\n+  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\n+form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\n+the above requirements apply either way.\n+\n+  8. Termination.\n+\n+  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n+provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n+modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n+this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\n+paragraph of section 11).\n+\n+  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n+license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n+provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n+finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\n+holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n+prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n+\n+  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n+reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n+violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n+received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n+copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n+your receipt of the notice.\n+\n+  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n+licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n+this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n+reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\n+material under section 10.\n+\n+  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n+\n+  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n+run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n+occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n+to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\n+nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\n+modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\n+not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n+covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n+\n+  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n+\n+  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n+receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n+propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\n+for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n+\n+  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\n+organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n+organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\n+work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n+transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n+licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\n+give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n+Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n+the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n+\n+  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n+rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\n+not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n+rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n+(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n+any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\n+sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n+\n+  11. Patents.\n+\n+  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n+License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\n+work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n+\n+  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\n+owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\n+hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\n+by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\n+but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\n+consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\n+purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\n+patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\n+this License.\n+\n+  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n+patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\n+make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\n+propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n+\n+  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\n+agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n+(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n+sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\n+party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\n+patent against the party.\n+\n+  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n+and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n+to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\n+publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\n+then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\n+available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n+patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\n+consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\n+license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\n+actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\n+covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\n+in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\n+country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n+\n+  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n+arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\n+covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n+receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\n+or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\n+you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\n+work and works based on it.\n+\n+  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\n+the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\n+conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\n+specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\n+work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\n+in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\n+to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n+the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n+parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n+patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n+conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n+for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n+contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n+or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n+\n+  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\n+any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\n+otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n+\n+  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n+\n+  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\n+covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\n+not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\n+to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\n+the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n+License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n+\n+  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n+\n+  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n+permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n+under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\n+combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\n+License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\n+but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\n+section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\n+combination as such.\n+\n+  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n+\n+  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\n+the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n+address new problems or concerns.\n+\n+  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\n+Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\n+Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\n+option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\n+version or of any later version published by the Free Software\n+Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\n+GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\n+by the Free Software Foundation.\n+\n+  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n+versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\n+public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\n+to choose that version for the Program.\n+\n+  Later license versions may give you additional or different\n+permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\n+author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\n+later version.\n+\n+  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n+\n+  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\n+APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\n+HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\n+OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\n+THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\n+IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\n+ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n+\n+  16. Limitation of Liability.\n+\n+  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n+WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\n+THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n+GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\n+USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\n+DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\n+PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\n+EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n+SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n+\n+  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\n+above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\n+reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\n+an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\n+Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\n+copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n+\n+                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n+\n+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n+\n+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\n+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n+state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n+the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n+\n+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n+\n+    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n+    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n+    (at your option) any later version.\n+\n+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n+    GNU General Public License for more details.\n+\n+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n+    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n+\n+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n+\n+  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\n+notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n+\n+    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n+    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n+\n+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\n+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\n+might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n+\n+  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\n+if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\n+For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n+<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n+\n+  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\n+into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\n+may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\n+the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\n+Public License instead of this License.
