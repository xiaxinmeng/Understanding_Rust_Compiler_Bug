I assumed from that that the preceding elements would be the *only* ones that were consumed, but in fact the returned element is consumed as well.\n\nThe way I read the documentation, I assumed that `nth(0)` would not discard anything (there are 0 preceding elements, and maybe it just peeks at the start of the iterator somehow), so I added a sentence clarifying that it does.
