Just remember that `String`s\n allocate memory and control their data, while `&str`s are a reference to\n another string, and you'll be all set.\n \n+# Vectors\n+\n+Like many programming languages, Rust has a list type for when you want a list\n+of things. But similar to strings, Rust has different types to represent this\n+idea: `Vec<T>` (a 'vector'), `[T, .. N]` (an 'array'), and `&[T]` (a 'slice').\n+Whew!\n+\n+Vectors are similar to `String`s: they have a dynamic length, and they\n+allocate enough memory to fit. You can create a vector with the `vec!` macro:\n+\n+```{rust}\n+let nums = vec![1i, 2i, 3i];\n+```\n+\n+Notice that unlike the `println!` macro we've used in the past, we use square\n+brackets (`[]`) with `vec!`. Rust allows you to use either in either situation,\n+this is just convention.\n+\n+You can create an array with just square brackets:\n+\n+```{rust}\n+let nums = [1i, 2i, 3i];\n+```\n+\n+So what's the difference? An array has a fixed size, so you can't add or\n+subtract elements:\n+\n+```{rust,ignore}\n+let mut nums = vec![1i, 2i, 3i];\n+nums.push(4i); // works\n+\n+let mut nums = [1i, 2i, 3i];\n+nums.push(4i); //  error: type `[int, .. 3]` does not implement any method\n+               // in scope named `push`\n+```\n+\n+The `push()` method lets you append a value to the end of the vector. But\n+since arrays have fixed sizes, adding an element doesn't make any sense.\n+You can see how it has the exact type in the error message: `[int, .. 3]`.\n+An array of `int`s, with length 3.\n+\n+Similar to `&str`, a slice is a reference to another array. We can get a\n+slice from a vector by using the `as_slice()` method:\n+\n+```{rust}\n+let vec = vec![1i, 2i, 3i];\n+let slice = vec.as_slice();\n+```\n+\n+All three types implement an `iter()` method, which returns an iterator. We'll\n+talk more about the details of iterators later, but for now, the `iter()` method\n+allows you to write a `for` loop that prints out the contents of a vector, array,\n+or slice:\n+\n+```{rust}\n+let vec = vec![1i, 2i, 3i];\n+\n+for i in vec.iter() {\n+    println!(\"{}\", i);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This code will print each number in order, on its own line.\n+\n+There's a whole lot more to vectors, but that's enough to get started.
