Windows currently ignores `current_dir` when locating the program, but Unix-like systems interpret the program path relative to `current_dir`. These implementation details aren't considered stable, and it's recommended to call `canonicalize` to get an absolute program path instead of using relative paths and `current_dir` together.\n\nI'd like to get feedback on:\n\n- _Should_ we consider those details stable? It might be disruptive to change them, regardless of what I can get away with claiming in docs :)\n- Is `canonicalize` an appropriate recommendation? As discussed in #37868 above, there are reasons it's not called automatically in the `Command` implementation.", "tree": {"sha": "a0feaffcbffbf842cdb1aee8b82b8b970659dd95", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/a0feaffcbffbf842cdb1aee8b82b8b970659dd95"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/ca63a4e4383f502cf541e0b0bc1c13541918103d", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/ca63a4e4383f502cf541e0b0bc1c13541918103d", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/ca63a4e4383f502cf541e0b0bc1c13541918103d", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/ca63a4e4383f502cf541e0b0bc1c13541918103d/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "f33921ba58754d1bfbaf483ddc6dc9dffdcd4de7", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/f33921ba58754d1bfbaf483ddc6dc9dffdcd4de7", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/f33921ba58754d1bfbaf483ddc6dc9dffdcd4de7"}, {"sha": "0945b74d73940e404a355eda0c8d6c202fae8a12", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/0945b74d73940e404a355eda0c8d6c202fae8a12", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/0945b74d73940e404a355eda0c8d6c202fae8a12"}], "stats": {"total": 10, "additions": 10, "deletions": 0}, "files": [{"sha": "58ac4e944087ee7416e2ed36e4a832f9497545b2", "filename": "src/libstd/process.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 10, "deletions": 0, "changes": 10, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/ca63a4e4383f502cf541e0b0bc1c13541918103d/src%2Flibstd%2Fprocess.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/ca63a4e4383f502cf541e0b0bc1c13541918103d/src%2Flibstd%2Fprocess.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Flibstd%2Fprocess.rs?ref=ca63a4e4383f502cf541e0b0bc1c13541918103d", "patch": "@@ -626,6 +626,14 @@ impl Command {\n \n     /// Sets the working directory for the child process.\n     ///\n+    /// # Platform-specific behavior\n+    ///\n+    /// If the program path is relative (e.g. `\"./script.sh\"`), it's ambiguous\n+    /// whether it should be interpreted relative to the parent's working\n+    /// directory or relative to `current_dir`.
