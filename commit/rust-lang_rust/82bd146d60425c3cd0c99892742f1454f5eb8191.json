In addition, there are several compiler-internal crates that are not considered to\n+be part of the official standard library, and thus would be a distraction to include in\n+documentation. It's not enough to exclude their crate documentation, since information about trait\n+implementations appears on the pages for both the type and the trait, which can be in different\n+crates!\n+\n+To prevent internal types from being included in documentation, the standard library adds an\n+attribute to their `extern crate` declarations: `#[doc(masked)]`. This causes Rustdoc to \"mask out\"\n+types from these crates when building lists of trait implementations.\n+\n+The `#[doc(masked)]` attribute is intended to be used internally, and is governed by a feature gate.\n+For more information, see [its chapter in the Unstable Book][unstable-masked] and [its tracking\n+issue][issue-masked].\n+\n+[unstable-masked]: ../unstable-book/language-features/doc-masked.html\n+[issue-masked]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44027"}]}
