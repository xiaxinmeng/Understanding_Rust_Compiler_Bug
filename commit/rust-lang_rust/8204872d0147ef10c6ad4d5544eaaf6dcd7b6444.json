So \"128-bit SIMD\" has 128-bit vectors, and that might be `f32x4`, `i32x4`, `i16x8`, or other variations. While 128-bit SIMD is the most common, there's also 64-bit, 256-bit, and even 512-bit on the newest CPUs.\n \n-* **Vertical:** When an operation is \"vertical\", each lane processes individually without regard to the other lane in the same vector. For example, a \"vertical add\" between two vectors would add lane 0 in `a` with lane 0 in `b`, with the total in lane 0 of `out`, and then the same thing for lanes 1, 2, etc. Most SIMD operations are vertical operations, so if your problem is a vertical problem then you can probably solve it with SIMD.\n+* **Vertical:** When an operation is \"vertical\", each lane processes individually without regard to the other lanes in the same vector.
