This test originated in a time long since passed when it was leveraged\nfor canceling I/O, but nowadays there's nothing fancy happening in the standard\nlibrary so it's not really a productive test anyway, hence just ignoring it on\nWindows.\n\nCloses #31657", "tree": {"sha": "52c10ec4d33e51a4a27aa334a36157c29011f155", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/52c10ec4d33e51a4a27aa334a36157c29011f155"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/2782e8f8fcefdce77c5e0dd0846c15c4c5103d84", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/2782e8f8fcefdce77c5e0dd0846c15c4c5103d84", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/2782e8f8fcefdce77c5e0dd0846c15c4c5103d84", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/2782e8f8fcefdce77c5e0dd0846c15c4c5103d84/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "1ca100d0428985f916eea153886762bed3909771", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/1ca100d0428985f916eea153886762bed3909771", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/1ca100d0428985f916eea153886762bed3909771"}, {"sha": "7eb43f1b20d352c69cb888c39409786b7dd78ffe", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/7eb43f1b20d352c69cb888c39409786b7dd78ffe", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/7eb43f1b20d352c69cb888c39409786b7dd78ffe"}], "stats": {"total": 1, "additions": 1, "deletions": 0}, "files": [{"sha": "cbc672c28bc6aa858f7a5b1c90f0f7aec8eafa91", "filename": "src/libstd/net/tcp.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 1, "deletions": 0, "changes": 1, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/2782e8f8fcefdce77c5e0dd0846c15c4c5103d84/src%2Flibstd%2Fnet%2Ftcp.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/2782e8f8fcefdce77c5e0dd0846c15c4c5103d84/src%2Flibstd%2Fnet%2Ftcp.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Flibstd%2Fnet%2Ftcp.rs?ref=2782e8f8fcefdce77c5e0dd0846c15c4c5103d84", "patch": "@@ -1153,6 +1153,7 @@ mod tests {\n     }\n \n     #[test]\n+    #[cfg(unix)] // test doesn't work on Windows, see #31657\n     fn close_read_wakes_up() {\n         each_ip(&mut |addr| {\n             let a = t!(TcpListener::bind(&addr));"}]}
