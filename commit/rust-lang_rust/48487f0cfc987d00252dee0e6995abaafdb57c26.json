You could try an older nightly with `rustup update\n nightly-<date>` where `<date>` is a few days or weeks ago, e.g. `2016-05-20` for\n May 20th. Otherwise, you could notify me in an issue or on IRC.

There's lots that\n+needs to be done that I haven't documented in the issues yet, however. For more\n+ideas or help with running or hacking on Miri, you can contact me (`scott`) on\n+Mozilla IRC in any of the Rust IRC channels (`#rust`, `#rust-offtopic`, etc).`\n \n ## License\n \n@@ -65,5 +75,4 @@ additional terms or conditions.\n [rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/\n [mir]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1211-mir.md\n [usask]: https://www.usask.ca/\n-[multirust]: https://github.com/brson/multirust\n [rustup]: https://www.rustup.rs"}]}
