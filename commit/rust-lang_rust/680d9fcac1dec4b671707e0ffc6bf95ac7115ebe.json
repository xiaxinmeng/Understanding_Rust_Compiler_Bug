Most users won't need to name this type which is probably why this wasn't noticed in the meantime.\n\nSee #83372 for a different but related bug.\n\n### Notes for reviewers\n\nI think I have got this right but TBH I am not very familiar with the relationship between core and std and so on.  <strike>I also haven't don't any kind of test (not even a build) yet.  I will do a local docs build to see that the type now appears in the std docs.</strike>  I did a local docs build and it has made this type appear as `std::str::SplitInclusive` as expected\n\nThe linkification of the return value from `str::split_inclusive` teleports me to the online url for `core::str::SplitInclusive`.  I think this may be a rustdoc anomaly (similar to #79630 maybe) but I am not sure.  Perhaps it means I haven't done the `std` -> `core` referrence correctly.\n\nI made this insta-stable since it seems like simply a bug.  Please LMK if that is not right.  *(edited to add:)* In particular, IDK how this ought to relate to the (?)current release process.", "tree": {"sha": "46e122ca8c8a073c57447c73bb95def1b36114a8", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/46e122ca8c8a073c57447c73bb95def1b36114a8"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/680d9fcac1dec4b671707e0ffc6bf95ac7115ebe", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/680d9fcac1dec4b671707e0ffc6bf95ac7115ebe", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/680d9fcac1dec4b671707e0ffc6bf95ac7115ebe", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/680d9fcac1dec4b671707e0ffc6bf95ac7115ebe/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "5b33de3340c7b36646af46303a30f7066b4bd7db", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/5b33de3340c7b36646af46303a30f7066b4bd7db", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/5b33de3340c7b36646af46303a30f7066b4bd7db"}, {"sha": "633a66fb66f5c9c433c58f4aa1da85eefe813fa5", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/633a66fb66f5c9c433c58f4aa1da85eefe813fa5", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/633a66fb66f5c9c433c58f4aa1da85eefe813fa5"}], "stats": {"total": 2, "additions": 2, "deletions": 0}, "files": [{"sha": "3730b407972be5d2e1c14a6365dab25391cc3819", "filename": "library/alloc/src/str.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 2, "deletions": 0, "changes": 2, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/680d9fcac1dec4b671707e0ffc6bf95ac7115ebe/library%2Falloc%2Fsrc%2Fstr.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/680d9fcac1dec4b671707e0ffc6bf95ac7115ebe/library%2Falloc%2Fsrc%2Fstr.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/library%2Falloc%2Fsrc%2Fstr.rs?ref=680d9fcac1dec4b671707e0ffc6bf95ac7115ebe", "patch": "@@ -46,6 +46,8 @@ pub use core::str::pattern;\n pub use core::str::EncodeUtf16;\n #[stable(feature = \"split_ascii_whitespace\", since = \"1.34.0\")]\n pub use core::str::SplitAsciiWhitespace;\n+#[stable(feature = \"split_inclusive\", since = \"1.53.0\")]\n+pub use core::str::SplitInclusive;\n #[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]\n pub use core::str::SplitWhitespace;\n #[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]"}]}
