But these are the ones most likely to work, as they have the most\n-testing.\n-\n-Finally, a comment about Windows. Rust considers Windows to be a first-class\n-platform upon release, but if we're honest, the Windows experience isn't as\n-integrated as the Linux/OS X experience is. We're working on it! If anything\n-doesn't work, it is a bug. Please let us know if that happens. Each and every\n-commit is tested against Windows just like any other platform.\n+The Rust compiler runs on, and compiles to, a great number of platforms, though\n+not all platforms are equally supported. Rust's support levels are organized\n+into three tiers, each with a different set of guarantees.\n+\n+Platforms are identified by their \"target triple\" which is the string to inform\n+the compiler what kind of output should be produced. The columns below indicate\n+whether the corresponding component works on the specified platform.\n+\n+### Tier 1\n+\n+Tier 1 platforms can be thought of as \"guaranteed to build and work\".\n+Specifically they will each satisfy the following requirements:\n+\n+* Automated testing is set up to run tests for the platform.\n+* Landing changes to the `rust-lang/rust` repository's master branch is gated on\n+  tests passing.\n+* Official release artifacts are provided for the platform.\n+* Documentation for how to use and how to build the platform is available.\n+\n+|  Target                       | std |rustc|cargo| notes                      |\n+|-------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------------------|\n+| `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`      |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 64-bit MSVC (Windows 7+)   |\n+| `i686-pc-windows-gnu`         |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 32-bit MinGW (Windows 7+)  |\n+| `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`       |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 64-bit MinGW (Windows 7+)  |\n+| `i686-apple-darwin`           |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 32-bit OSX (10.7+, Lion+)  |\n+| `x86_64-apple-darwin`         |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 64-bit OSX (10.7+, Lion+)  |\n+| `i686-unknown-linux-gnu`      |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 32-bit Linux (2.6.18+)     |\n+| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`    |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 64-bit Linux (2.6.18+)     |\n+\n+### Tier 2\n+\n+Tier 2 platforms can be thought of as \"guaranteed to build\". Automated tests are\n+not run so it's not guaranteed to produce a working build, but platforms often\n+work to quite a good degree and patches are always welcome! Specifically, these\n+platforms are required to have each of the following:\n+\n+* Automated building is set up, but may not be running tests.\n+* Landing changes to the `rust-lang/rust` repository's master branch is gated on\n+  platforms **building**. Note that this means for some platforms just the\n+  standard library is compiled, but for others the full bootstrap is run.\n+* Official release artifacts are provided for the platform.\n+\n+|  Target                       | std |rustc|cargo| notes                      |\n+|-------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------------------|\n+| `i686-pc-windows-msvc`        |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 32-bit MSVC (Windows 7+)   |\n+\n+### Tier 3\n+\n+Tier 3 platforms are those which Rust has support for, but landing changes is\n+not gated on the platform either building or passing tests. Working builds for\n+these platforms may be spotty as their reliability is often defined in terms of\n+community contributions. Additionally, release artifacts and installers are not\n+provided, but there may be community infrastructure producing these in\n+unofficial locations.\n+\n+|  Target                       | std |rustc|cargo| notes                      |\n+|-------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------------------|\n+| `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`   |  \u2713  |     |     | 64-bit Linux with MUSL     |\n+| `arm-linux-androideabi`       |  \u2713  |     |     | ARM Android                |\n+| `i686-linux-android`          |  \u2713  |     |     | 32-bit x86 Android         |\n+| `aarch64-linux-android`       |  \u2713  |     |     | ARM64 Android              |\n+| `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi`   |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |     | ARM Linux (2.6.18+)        |\n+| `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |     | ARM Linux (2.6.18+)        |\n+| `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`   |  \u2713  |     |     | ARM64 Linux (2.6.18+)      |\n+| `mips-unknown-linux-gnu`      |  \u2713  |     |     | MIPS Linux (2.6.18+)       |\n+| `mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu`    |  \u2713  |     |     | MIPS (LE) Linux (2.6.18+)  |\n+| `powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu`   |  \u2713  |     |     | PowerPC Linux (2.6.18+)    |\n+| `i386-apple-ios`              |  \u2713  |     |     | 32-bit x86 iOS             |\n+| `x86_64-apple-ios`            |  \u2713  |     |     | 64-bit x86 iOS             |\n+| `armv7-apple-ios`             |  \u2713  |     |     | ARM iOS                    |\n+| `armv7s-apple-ios`            |  \u2713  |     |     | ARM iOS                    |\n+| `aarch64-apple-ios`           |  \u2713  |     |     | ARM64 iOS                  |\n+| `i686-unknown-freebsd`        |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |     | 32-bit FreeBSD             |\n+| `x86_64-unknown-freebsd`      |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |     | 64-bit FreeBSD             |\n+| `x86_64-unknown-openbsd`      |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |     | 64-bit OpenBSD             |\n+| `x86_64-unknown-netbsd`       |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |     | 64-bit NetBSD              |\n+| `x86_64-unknown-bitrig`       |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |     | 64-bit Bitrig              |\n+| `x86_64-unknown-dragonfly`    |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |     | 64-bit DragonFlyBSD        |\n+| `x86_64-rumprun-netbsd`       |  \u2713  |     |     | 64-bit NetBSD Rump Kernel  |\n+| `i686-pc-windows-msvc` (XP)   |  \u2713  |     |     | Windows XP support         |\n+| `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` (XP) |  \u2713  |     |     | Windows XP support         |\n+\n+Note that this table can be expanded over time, this isn't the exhaustive set of\n+tier 3 platforms that will ever be!\n \n ## After installation\n "}]}
