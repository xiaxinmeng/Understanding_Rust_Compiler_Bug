Currently this is mostly a stab in the dark as it's not\nconfirmed to actually fix the problem, but it's probably not a bad change to\nhave anyway!\n\ncc #33844\nCloses #17360", "tree": {"sha": "c71a9bba8192d85394b98e49ab1b19cc67f513f9", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/c71a9bba8192d85394b98e49ab1b19cc67f513f9"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/1564e92940fcc50e566bc5031dbc73540523688d", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/1564e92940fcc50e566bc5031dbc73540523688d", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/1564e92940fcc50e566bc5031dbc73540523688d", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/1564e92940fcc50e566bc5031dbc73540523688d/comments", "author": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "12238b984abfacb2cccea176f862c94aa1231fb5", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/12238b984abfacb2cccea176f862c94aa1231fb5", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/12238b984abfacb2cccea176f862c94aa1231fb5"}], "stats": {"total": 20, "additions": 16, "deletions": 4}, "files": [{"sha": "156f17761933517ebce2f993cc6deeed23c88a34", "filename": "src/librustc_driver/driver.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 16, "deletions": 4, "changes": 20, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1564e92940fcc50e566bc5031dbc73540523688d/src%2Flibrustc_driver%2Fdriver.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/1564e92940fcc50e566bc5031dbc73540523688d/src%2Flibrustc_driver%2Fdriver.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Flibrustc_driver%2Fdriver.rs?ref=1564e92940fcc50e566bc5031dbc73540523688d", "patch": "@@ -669,12 +669,24 @@ pub fn phase_2_configure_and_expand<'a>(sess: &Session,\n         // dependent dlls.
