Still, some\n+things (like adding support for a new intrinsic) can be done by working just on\n+the miri side.\n+\n+To prepare, make sure you are using a nightly Rust compiler.

We recommend using `--release` to make test running take\n+less time.\n+\n+Now you are set up!  You can write a failing test case, and tweak miri until it\n+fails no more.\n+\n+### Using a locally built rustc\n \n Since the heart of Miri (the main interpreter engine) lives in rustc, working on\n-Miri will often require using a locally built rustc. This includes getting a\n-trace of the execution, as distributed rustc has `debug!` and `trace!` disabled.\n+Miri will often require using a locally built rustc.  The bug you want to fix\n+may actually be on the rustc side, or you just need to get more detailed trace\n+of the execution -- in both cases, you should develop miri against a rustc you\n+compiled yourself, with debug assertions (and hence tracing) enabled.\n \n-The first-time setup for a local rustc looks as follows:\n+The setup for a local rustc works as follows:\n ```sh\n git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/ rustc\n cd rustc\n cp config.toml.example config.toml\n # Now edit `config.toml` and set `debug-assertions = true` and `test-miri = true`.\n # The latter is important to build libstd with the right flags for miri.\n+# This step can take 30 minutes and more.\n ./x.py build src/rustc\n+# If you change something, you can get a faster rebuild by doing\n+./x.py --keep-stage 0 build src/rustc\n # You may have to change the architecture in the next command\n rustup toolchain link custom build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage2\n-# Now cd to your Miri directory\n+# Now cd to your Miri directory, then configure rustup\n rustup override set custom\n+# We also need to tell Miri where to find its sysroot. Since we set\n+# `test-miri` above, we can just use rustc' sysroot.\n+export MIRI_SYSROOT=$(rustc --print sysroot)\n ```\n-The `build` step can take 30 minutes and more.\n \n-Now you can `cargo build` Miri, and you can `cargo test --release` it.  `cargo\n-test --release FILTER` only runs those tests that contain `FILTER` in their\n-filename (including the base directory, e.g. `cargo test --release fail` will\n-run all compile-fail tests).  We recommend using `--release` to make test\n-running take less time.\n-\n-Notice that the \"fullmir\" tests only run if you have `MIRI_SYSROOT` set, the\n-test runner does not realized that your libstd comes with full MIR.  The\n-following will set it correctly:\n-```sh\n-MIRI_SYSROOT=$(rustc --print sysroot) cargo test --release\n-```\n+With this, you should now have a working development setup!
