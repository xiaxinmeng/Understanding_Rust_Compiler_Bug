But\n sometimes, that is not enough.\n \n-### Building Miri with a locally built rustc\n+A big part of the Miri driver is shared with rustc, so working on Miri will\n+sometimes require also working on rustc itself. In this case, you should *not*\n+work in a clone of the Miri repository, but in a clone of the\n+[main Rust repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/). There is a copy of\n+Miri located at `src/tools/miri` that you can work on directly. A maintainer\n+will eventually sync those changes back into this repository.\n \n-[building Miri with a locally built rustc]: #building-miri-with-a-locally-built-rustc\n+When working on Miri in the rustc tree, here's how you can run tests:\n \n-A big part of the Miri driver lives in rustc, so working on Miri will sometimes\n-require using a locally built rustc. The bug you want to fix may actually be on\n-the rustc side, or you just need to get more detailed trace of the execution\n-than what is possible with release builds -- in both cases, you should develop\n-Miri against a rustc you compiled yourself, with debug assertions (and hence\n-tracing) enabled.\n-\n-The setup for a local rustc works as follows:\n-```sh\n-# Clone the rust-lang/rust repo.\n-git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust rustc\n-cd rustc\n-# Create a config.toml with defaults for working on Miri.\n-./x.py setup compiler\n- # Now edit `config.toml` and under `[rust]` set `debug-assertions = true`.\n-\n-# Build a stage 2 rustc, and build the rustc libraries with that rustc.\n-# This step can take 30 minutes or more.\n-./x.py build --stage 2 compiler/rustc\n-# If you change something, you can get a faster rebuild by doing\n-./x.py build --keep-stage 0 --stage 2 compiler/rustc\n-# You may have to change the architecture in the next command\n-rustup toolchain link stage2 build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage2\n-# Now cd to your Miri directory, then configure rustup\n-rustup override set stage2\n ```\n-\n-Note: When you are working with a locally built rustc or any other toolchain that\n-is not the same as the one in `rust-version`, you should not have `.auto-everything` or\n-`.auto-toolchain` as that will keep resetting your toolchain.\n-\n-```sh\n-rm -f .auto-everything .auto-toolchain\n+./x.py test miri --stage 0\n ```\n \n-Important: You need to delete the Miri cache when you change the stdlib; otherwise the\n-old, chached version will be used. On Linux, the cache is located at `~/.cache/miri`,\n-and on Windows, it is located at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\rust-lang\\miri\\cache`; the exact\n-location is printed after the library build: \"A libstd for Miri is now available in ...\".\n-\n-Note: `./x.py --stage 2 compiler/rustc` currently errors with `thread 'main'\n-panicked at 'fs::read(stamp) failed with No such file or directory (os error 2)`,\n-you can simply ignore that error; Miri will build anyway.\n+`--bless` will work, too.\n \n-For more information about building and configuring a local compiler,\n-see <https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/how-to-build-and-run.html>.\n+You can also directly run Miri on a Rust source file:\n \n-With this, you should now have a working development setup! See\n-[above](#building-and-testing-miri) for how to proceed working on Miri.\n+```\n+./x.py run miri --stage 0 --args src/tools/miri/tests/pass/hello.rs\n+```\n \n ## Advanced topic: Syncing with the rustc repo\n "}]}
