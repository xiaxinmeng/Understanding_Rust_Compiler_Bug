The core problem was that the type\n+// folding code was over-zealously passing back all lifetimes when\n+// doing region-folding, when really all clients of the region-folding\n+// case only want to see FREE lifetime variables, not bound ones.\n+\n+pub fn main() {\n+    fn explicit() {\n+        fn test(_x: Option<|f: <'a> |g: &'a int||>) {}\n+        test(Some(|_f: <'a> |g: &'a int|| {}));\n+    }\n+\n+    // The code below is shorthand for the code above (and more likely\n+    // to represent what one encounters in practice).\n+    fn implicit() {\n+        fn test(_x: Option<|f:      |g: &   int||>) {}\n+        test(Some(|_f:      |g: &   int|| {}));\n+    }\n+\n+    explicit();\n+    implicit();\n+}"}]}
