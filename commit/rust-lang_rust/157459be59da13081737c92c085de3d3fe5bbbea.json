However, rustc doesn't do any normalization now.\r\n\r\nWe may want to do any normalization for symbols, but normalizing whole text seems harmful because doing so loses some sort of information even if we choose a non-K variant of normalization.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest removing \"normalized to Unicode normalization form NFKC\" phrase for the present so that the manual represents the current state properly. When we address the problem (with a RFC?), then the manual should be updated.\r\n\r\nCloses #12388.\r\n\r\nReference: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/2253", "tree": {"sha": "d766f861abf0129fd1545ad808bf658bea30181b", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/d766f861abf0129fd1545ad808bf658bea30181b"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/157459be59da13081737c92c085de3d3fe5bbbea", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/157459be59da13081737c92c085de3d3fe5bbbea", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/157459be59da13081737c92c085de3d3fe5bbbea", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/157459be59da13081737c92c085de3d3fe5bbbea/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "ade92c6e35c75f9bbb99681bfd6f34fa4711366a", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/ade92c6e35c75f9bbb99681bfd6f34fa4711366a", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/ade92c6e35c75f9bbb99681bfd6f34fa4711366a"}, {"sha": "bf2d98e1900d854b88192a439993161c665881fe", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/bf2d98e1900d854b88192a439993161c665881fe", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/bf2d98e1900d854b88192a439993161c665881fe"}], "stats": {"total": 3, "additions": 1, "deletions": 2}, "files": [{"sha": "a07b8a42dc00493bde26a07d0186f9e37efb90d5", "filename": "src/doc/rust.md", "status": "modified", "additions": 1, "deletions": 2, "changes": 3, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/157459be59da13081737c92c085de3d3fe5bbbea/src%2Fdoc%2Frust.md", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/157459be59da13081737c92c085de3d3fe5bbbea/src%2Fdoc%2Frust.md", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Fdoc%2Frust.md?ref=157459be59da13081737c92c085de3d3fe5bbbea", "patch": "@@ -112,8 +112,7 @@ production.
