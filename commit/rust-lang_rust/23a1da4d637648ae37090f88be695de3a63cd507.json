These traits are intended to be the primary interface for their types, and are\n+often the only thing available to be documented on their types. For this reason, Rustdoc will track\n+when a given type implements one of these traits and call special attention to it when a function\n+returns one of these types. This is the \"Important Traits\" dialog, visible as a circle-i button next\n+to the function, which, when clicked, shows the dialog.\n+\n+In the standard library, the traits that qualify for inclusion are `Iterator`, `io::Read`, and\n+`io::Write`. However, rather than being implemented as a hard-coded list, these traits have a\n+special marker attribute on them: `#[doc(spotlight)]`. This means that you could apply this\n+attribute to your own trait to include it in the \"Important Traits\" dialog in documentation.\n+\n+The `#[doc(spotlight)]` attribute is controlled by a feature gate.
