Newer versions of gdb recognize that the special function called __morestack may change the stack pointer to a different stack.\n+This message indicates a memory leak, and is mostly likely to happen on rarely exercised failure paths. Note that failure unwinding is not yet implemented on windows so this is expected. If you see this on Linux or Mac it's a compiler bug; please report it.\n \n # Why did my build create a bunch of zero-length files in my lib directory?\n "}, {"sha": "04682a56e97481f200034e25f889d59e26f921b8", "filename": "doc/index.md", "status": "modified", "additions": 28, "deletions": 26, "changes": 54, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/a30d61b05a7b11bcc52c2d4988c0a5f7fedce2ff/doc%2Findex.md", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/a30d61b05a7b11bcc52c2d4988c0a5f7fedce2ff/doc%2Findex.md", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/doc%2Findex.md?ref=a30d61b05a7b11bcc52c2d4988c0a5f7fedce2ff", "patch": "@@ -6,44 +6,46 @@\n .header-section-number { display: none; }\n </style>\n \n-[The Rust tutorial](tutorial.html)  \n-[The Rust reference manual](rust.html) ([PDF](rust.pdf))  \n+[The Rust tutorial](tutorial.html)  ([PDF](tutorial.pdf))\n+[The Rust reference manual](rust.html) ([PDF](rust.pdf))\n \n # Guides\n \n-[Pointers](guide-pointers.html)  \n-[References and Lifetimes](guide-lifetimes.html)  \n-[Containers and Iterators](guide-container.html)  \n-[Tasks and Communication](guide-tasks.html)  \n-[Foreign Function Interface](guide-ffi.html)  \n-[Macros](guide-macros.html)  \n-[Packaging](guide-rustpkg.html)  \n-[Testing](guide-testing.html)  \n-[Conditions](guide-conditions.html)  \n+[Pointers](guide-pointers.html)\n+[References and Lifetimes](guide-lifetimes.html)\n+[Containers and Iterators](guide-container.html)\n+[Tasks and Communication](guide-tasks.html)\n+[Foreign Function Interface](guide-ffi.html)\n+[Macros](guide-macros.html)\n+[Packaging](guide-rustpkg.html)\n+[Testing](guide-testing.html)\n+[Conditions](guide-conditions.html)\n \n # Libraries\n \n-[std](std/index.html)  \n-[extra](extra/index.html)  \n-[green](green/index.html)  \n-[native](native/index.html)  \n-[syntax](syntax/index.html)  \n-[rustc](rustc/index.html)  \n+[The standard library, `libstd`](std/index.html)\n+[The extra library, `libextra`](extra/index.html)\n+\n+[The M:N runtime library, `libgreen`](green/index.html)\n+[The 1:1 runtime library, `libnative`](native/index.html)\n+\n+[The Rust parser, `libsyntax`](syntax/index.html)\n+[The Rust compiler, `librustc`](rustc/index.html)\n \n # Tooling\n \n-[The rustpkg manual](rustpkg.html)  \n+[The `rustpkg` manual](rustpkg.html)\n \n # FAQs\n \n-[Language FAQ](complement-lang-faq.html)  \n-[Project FAQ](complement-project-faq.html)  \n-[Usage FAQ](complement-usage-faq.html)  \n-[Code cheatsheet](complement-cheatsheet.html) -
