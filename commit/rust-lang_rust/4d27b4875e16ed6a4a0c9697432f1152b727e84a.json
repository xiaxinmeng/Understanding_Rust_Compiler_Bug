Languages like Haskell gets flak from using short, non-descriptive names, while in reality, there are clear conventions and reasons for using certain terse variable names. \r\n\r\nThis is just a proposed explanation of this convention, as I've interpreted it - I assumed that the convention came from a language like Haskell, so I tailored it according to that. So beware that I might have misjudged how it is used in the Rust language, or at least how it is used in the Rust tutorial.", "tree": {"sha": "14156aecfe8b49626fe840d0ed5c57055e07351c", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/14156aecfe8b49626fe840d0ed5c57055e07351c"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/4d27b4875e16ed6a4a0c9697432f1152b727e84a", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/4d27b4875e16ed6a4a0c9697432f1152b727e84a", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/4d27b4875e16ed6a4a0c9697432f1152b727e84a", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/4d27b4875e16ed6a4a0c9697432f1152b727e84a/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "c4a63fabe345967e7d6b4570752ea081cae21785", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/c4a63fabe345967e7d6b4570752ea081cae21785", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c4a63fabe345967e7d6b4570752ea081cae21785"}, {"sha": "14e245bd47d3ac1a981d50a6f752aa27cca7d85e", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/14e245bd47d3ac1a981d50a6f752aa27cca7d85e", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/14e245bd47d3ac1a981d50a6f752aa27cca7d85e"}], "stats": {"total": 10, "additions": 10, "deletions": 0}, "files": [{"sha": "1942ed54097faea2a5ec815c35bd15910245dbea", "filename": "src/doc/tutorial.md", "status": "modified", "additions": 10, "deletions": 0, "changes": 10, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/4d27b4875e16ed6a4a0c9697432f1152b727e84a/src%2Fdoc%2Ftutorial.md", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/4d27b4875e16ed6a4a0c9697432f1152b727e84a/src%2Fdoc%2Ftutorial.md", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Fdoc%2Ftutorial.md?ref=4d27b4875e16ed6a4a0c9697432f1152b727e84a", "patch": "@@ -1133,6 +1133,16 @@ let xs = Cons(1, box Cons(2, box Cons(3, box Nil)));\n let ys = xs; // copies `Cons(u32, pointer)` shallowly\n ~~~\n \n+> *Note:* Names like `xs` and `ys` are a naming\n+> convention for collection-like data structures\n+> (like our `List`).
