[ \"if\" expr ] ;\n An `alt` expression branches on a *pattern*. The exact form of matching that\n occurs depends on the pattern. Patterns consist of some combination of\n literals, destructured enum constructors, records and tuples, variable binding\n-specifications and placeholders (`_`). An `alt` expression has a *head\n+specifications, wildcards (`*`), and placeholders (`_`). An `alt` expression has a *head\n expression*, which is the value to compare to the patterns. The type of the\n patterns must equal the type of the head expression.\n \n+In a pattern whose head expression has an `enum` type, a placeholder (`_`) stands for a\n+*single* data field, whereas a wildcard `*` stands for *all* the fields of a particular\n+variant. For example:\n+\n+~~~~\n+enum list<X> { nil, cons(X, @list<X>) }\n+\n+let x: list<int> = cons(10, @cons(11, @nil));\n+\n+alt x {\n+    cons(_, @nil) { fail \"singleton list\"; }\n+    cons(*)       { ret; }\n+    nil           { fail \"empty list\"; }\n+}\n+~~~~\n+\n+The first pattern matches lists constructed by applying `cons` to any head value, and a\n+tail value of `@nil`. The second pattern matches `any` list constructed with `cons`,\n+ignoring the values of its arguments. \n+\n To execute an `alt` expression, first the head expression is evaluated, then\n its value is sequentially compared to the patterns in the arms until a match\n is found. The first arm with a matching pattern is chosen as the branch target"}]}
