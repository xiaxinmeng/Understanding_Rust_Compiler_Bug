In 2016, @oli-obk joined to\n+prepare miri for eventually being used as const evaluator in the Rust compiler\n+itself (basically, for `const` and `static` stuff), replacing the old evaluator\n+that worked directly on the AST.  In 2017, @RalfJung did an internship with\n+Mozilla and began developing miri towards a tool for detecting undefined\n+behavior, and also using miri as a way to explore the consequences of various\n+possible definitions for undefined behavior in Rust.  @oli-obk's move of the\n+miri engine into the compiler finally came to completion in early 2018.\n+Meanwhile, later that year, @RalfJung did a second internship, developing miri\n+further with support for checking basic type invariants and verifying that\n+references are used according to their aliasing restrictions.\n+\n+[usask]: https://www.usask.ca/\n+\n ## License\n \n Licensed under either of"}]}
