This means that from-source builds, including\nour release channels, will have this option enabled as well. Motivated\nby #29941, this change means that the compiler should be usable as-is on all\nplatforms just after extraction or installation. This experience is already true\non Windows but on Unixes you still need to set up LD_LIBRARY_PATH or the\nequivalent, which can often be unfortunate.\n\nThis option was originally turned off by default for Linux distributions who\ntend to take care of these sorts of details themselves, so it is expected that\nall those builds of Rust will want to pass `--disable-rpath` to the configure\nscript to preserve that behavior.\n\nCloses #29941", "tree": {"sha": "21e4b10ed9aca6b3404d345d7f2cc3415a502549", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/21e4b10ed9aca6b3404d345d7f2cc3415a502549"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/45e52dadb8548dcbe8da91fe624dd991b4994e70", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/45e52dadb8548dcbe8da91fe624dd991b4994e70", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/45e52dadb8548dcbe8da91fe624dd991b4994e70", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/45e52dadb8548dcbe8da91fe624dd991b4994e70/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "42c3ef8f9fd4b0dd1f881c49323bad456163f202", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/42c3ef8f9fd4b0dd1f881c49323bad456163f202", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/42c3ef8f9fd4b0dd1f881c49323bad456163f202"}, {"sha": "9bff8b090a1ee7bc03fc9b1cd2fac14ad5c77023", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/9bff8b090a1ee7bc03fc9b1cd2fac14ad5c77023", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/9bff8b090a1ee7bc03fc9b1cd2fac14ad5c77023"}], "stats": {"total": 2, "additions": 1, "deletions": 1}, "files": [{"sha": "c4944f53463506d65df6822e472b6f1063763c16", "filename": "configure", "status": "modified", "additions": 1, "deletions": 1, "changes": 2, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/45e52dadb8548dcbe8da91fe624dd991b4994e70/configure", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/45e52dadb8548dcbe8da91fe624dd991b4994e70/configure", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/configure?ref=45e52dadb8548dcbe8da91fe624dd991b4994e70", "patch": "@@ -587,7 +587,7 @@ opt fast-make 0 \"use .gitmodules as timestamp for submodule deps\"\n opt ccache 0 \"invoke gcc/clang via ccache to reuse object files between builds\"\n opt local-rust 0 \"use an installed rustc rather than downloading a snapshot\"\n opt llvm-static-stdcpp 0 \"statically link to libstdc++ for LLVM\"\n-opt rpath 0 \"build rpaths into rustc itself\"\n+opt rpath 1 \"build rpaths into rustc itself\"\n opt stage0-landing-pads 1 \"enable landing pads during bootstrap with stage0\"\n # This is used by the automation to produce single-target nightlies\n opt dist-host-only 0 \"only install bins for the host architecture\""}]}
