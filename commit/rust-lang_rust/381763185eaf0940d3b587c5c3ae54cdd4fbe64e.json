But when the inner writer is broken, and returning errors,\n`into_inner` simply gives you the error from flush, and the same\n`Bufwriter` back again.\n\nHere I provide the necessary function, which I have chosen to call\n`into_raw_parts`.\n\nI had to do something with `panicked`.  Returning it to the caller as\na boolean seemed rather bare.  Throwing the buffered data away in this\nsituation also seems unfriendly: maybe the programmer knows something\nabout the underlying writer and can recover somehow.\n\nSo I went for a custom Error.  This may be overkill, but it does have\nthe nice property that a caller who actually wants to look at the\nbuffered data, rather than simply extracting the inner writer, will be\ntold by the type system if they forget to handle the panicked case.\n\nIf a caller doesn't need the buffer, it can just be discarded.  That\nWriterPanicked is a newtype around Vec<u8> means that hopefully the\nlayouts of the Ok and Err variants can be very similar, with just a\nboolean discriminant.  So this custom error type should compile down\nto nearly no code.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ian Jackson <ijackson@chiark.greenend.org.uk>", "tree": {"sha": "529acf9a1c25cf872f69e7232c1d1c0083a4b41f", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/529acf9a1c25cf872f69e7232c1d1c0083a4b41f"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/381763185eaf0940d3b587c5c3ae54cdd4fbe64e", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/381763185eaf0940d3b587c5c3ae54cdd4fbe64e", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/381763185eaf0940d3b587c5c3ae54cdd4fbe64e", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/381763185eaf0940d3b587c5c3ae54cdd4fbe64e/comments", "author": {"login": "ijackson", "id": 2090772, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTA3NzI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2090772?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson", "html_url": "https://github.com/ijackson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "ijackson", "id": 2090772, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTA3NzI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2090772?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson", "html_url": "https://github.com/ijackson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ijackson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "c4926d01ada661d4fbffb0e5b1708ae5463d47b3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/c4926d01ada661d4fbffb0e5b1708ae5463d47b3", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c4926d01ada661d4fbffb0e5b1708ae5463d47b3"}], "stats": {"total": 73, "additions": 73, "deletions": 0}, "files": [{"sha": "a1c5f22d41794da38f121d080aee8dd3bb878c98", "filename": "library/std/src/io/buffered/bufwriter.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 73, "deletions": 0, "changes": 73, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/381763185eaf0940d3b587c5c3ae54cdd4fbe64e/library%2Fstd%2Fsrc%2Fio%2Fbuffered%2Fbufwriter.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/381763185eaf0940d3b587c5c3ae54cdd4fbe64e/library%2Fstd%2Fsrc%2Fio%2Fbuffered%2Fbufwriter.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/library%2Fstd%2Fsrc%2Fio%2Fbuffered%2Fbufwriter.rs?ref=381763185eaf0940d3b587c5c3ae54cdd4fbe64e", "patch": "@@ -1,7 +1,9 @@\n+use crate::error;\n use crate::fmt;\n use crate::io::{\n     self, Error, ErrorKind, IntoInnerError, IoSlice, Seek, SeekFrom, Write, DEFAULT_BUF_SIZE,\n };\n+use crate::mem;\n \n /// Wraps a writer and buffers its output.\n ///\n@@ -287,6 +289,77 @@ impl<W: Write> BufWriter<W> {\n             Ok(()) => Ok(self.inner.take().unwrap()),\n         }\n     }\n+\n+    /// Disassembles this `BufWriter<W>`, returning the underlying writer, and any buffered but\n+    /// unwritten data.\n+    ///\n+    /// If the underlying writer panicked, it is not known what portion of the data was written.\n+    /// In this case, we return `WriterPanicked` for the buffered data (from which the buffer\n+    /// contents can still be recovered).\n+    ///\n+    /// `into_raw_parts` makes no attempt to flush data and cannot fail.\n+    ///\n+    /// # Examples\n+    ///\n+    /// ```\n+    /// #![feature(bufwriter_into_raw_parts)]\n+    /// use std::io::{BufWriter, Write};\n+    ///\n+    /// let mut buffer = [0u8;
