License Grants and Conditions\n---------------------------------\n-\n-2.1. Grants\n-\n-Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\n-non-exclusive license:\n-\n-(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)\n-    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,\n-    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its\n-    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or\n-    as part of a Larger Work; and\n-\n-(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer\n-    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its\n-    Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n-\n-2.2. Effective Date\n-\n-The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution\n-become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first\n-distributes such Contribution.\n-\n-2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n-\n-The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\n-this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\n-distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\n-Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\n-Contributor:\n-\n-(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n-    or\n-\n-(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n-    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n-    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n-    Version); or\n-\n-(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n-    its Contributions.\n-\n-This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\n-or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\n-the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n-\n-2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n-\n-No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n-distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\n-License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\n-permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n-\n-2.5. Representation\n-\n-Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n-Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\n-to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n-\n-2.6. Fair Use\n-\n-This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\n-applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\n-equivalents.\n-\n-2.7. Conditions\n-\n-Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\n-in Section 2.1.\n-\n-3. Responsibilities\n--------------------\n-\n-3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n-\n-All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n-Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n-the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n-Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n-License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n-attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n-Form.\n-\n-3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n-\n-If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n-\n-(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n-    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n-    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n-    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n-    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n-\n-(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n-    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n-    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n-    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n-\n-3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n-\n-You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n-provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n-the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n-Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n-Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n-License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n-under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n-the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n-Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n-License(s).\n-\n-3.4. Notices\n-\n-You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n-(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\n-or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\n-the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\n-the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n-\n-3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n-\n-You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n-indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n-Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n-behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n-such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n-You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n-liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n-indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n-disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n-jurisdiction.\n-\n-4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n----------------------------------------------------\n-\n-If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n-License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\n-statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n-the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n-describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n-be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\n-Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\n-or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n-recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n-\n-5. Termination\n---------------\n-\n-5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n-if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\n-compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n-Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n-Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n-ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n-non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n-come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n-Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n-notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n-first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n-from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n-Your receipt of the notice.\n-\n-5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n-infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n-counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n-directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n-You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n-2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n-\n-5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\n-end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\n-have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\n-prior to termination shall survive termination.\n-\n-************************************************************************\n-*                                                                      *\n-*  6.

Litigation\n--------------\n-\n-Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\n-courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\n-place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\n-jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\n-Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\n-cross-claims or counter-claims.\n-\n-9. Miscellaneous\n-----------------\n-\n-This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\n-matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n-unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n-necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\n-that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\n-shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n-\n-10. Versions of the License\n----------------------------\n-\n-10.1. New Versions\n-\n-Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n-10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n-publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n-distinguishing version number.\n-\n-10.2. Effect of New Versions\n-\n-You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\n-of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\n-or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n-steward.\n-\n-10.3. Modified Versions\n-\n-If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n-create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\n-modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\n-any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\n-such modified license differs from this License).\n-\n-10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\n-Licenses\n-\n-If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\n-Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\n-notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n-\n-Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n--------------------------------------------\n-\n-  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public\n-  License, v. 2.0.
