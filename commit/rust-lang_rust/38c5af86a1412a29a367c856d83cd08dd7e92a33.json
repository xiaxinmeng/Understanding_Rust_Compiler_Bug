It's most commonly seen when attempting to\n+return a closure:\n+\n+```\n+fn foo() -> Box<Fn(u32) -> u32> {\n+    let x = 0u32;\n+    Box::new(|y| x + y)\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Notice that `x` is stack-allocated by `foo()`. By default, Rust captures\n+closed-over data by reference. This means that once `foo()` returns, `x` no\n+longer exists. An attempt to access `x` within the closure would thus be unsafe.\n+\n+Another situation where this might be encountered is when spawning threads:\n+\n+```\n+fn foo() {\n+    let x = 0u32;\n+    let y = 1u32;\n+\n+    let thr = std::thread::spawn(|| {\n+        x + y\n+    });\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Since our new thread runs in parallel, the stack frame containing `x` and `y`\n+may well have disappeared by the time we try to use them. Even if we call\n+`thr.join()` within foo (which blocks until `thr` has completed, ensuring the\n+stack frame won't disappear), we will not succeed: the compiler cannot prove\n+that this behaviour is safe, and so won't let us do it.\n+\n+The solution to this problem is usually to switch to using a `move` closure.\n+This approach moves (or copies, where possible) data into the closure, rather\n+than taking references to it. For example:\n+\n+```\n+fn foo() -> Box<Fn(u32) -> u32> {\n+    let x = 0u32;\n+    Box::new(move |y| x + y)\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Now that the closure has its own copy of the data, there's no need to worry\n+about safety.\n+\"##,\n+\n E0381: r##\"\n It is not allowed to use or capture an uninitialized variable.
