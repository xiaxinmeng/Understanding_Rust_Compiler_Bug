The right block is\nthen treated the same way by the already present logic in the merge\nloop.\n\nReduces runtime of .sort() to less than 50% of the previous, if the data\nwas already perfectly sorted. Sorted data with a few swaps are also\nsorted quicker than before. The overhead of one comparison per merge\nseems to be negligible.", "tree": {"sha": "7e0ec48d4a05927939f8b0e5759b922b7e345172", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/7e0ec48d4a05927939f8b0e5759b922b7e345172"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/35fd1bab5e727061248c7810ca1fbe81e336d019", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/35fd1bab5e727061248c7810ca1fbe81e336d019", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/35fd1bab5e727061248c7810ca1fbe81e336d019", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/35fd1bab5e727061248c7810ca1fbe81e336d019/comments", "author": {"login": "bluss", "id": 3209739, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDk3Mzk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3209739?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss", "html_url": "https://github.com/bluss", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bluss", "id": 3209739, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDk3Mzk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3209739?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss", "html_url": "https://github.com/bluss", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bluss/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "792a9f12cff83186a5426bc6e713fbc11261a4b1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/792a9f12cff83186a5426bc6e713fbc11261a4b1", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/792a9f12cff83186a5426bc6e713fbc11261a4b1"}], "stats": {"total": 10, "additions": 10, "deletions": 0}, "files": [{"sha": "cb3f39e0cac4b2c187da438cbd6dccd8c2895964", "filename": "src/libcollections/slice.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 10, "deletions": 0, "changes": 10, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/35fd1bab5e727061248c7810ca1fbe81e336d019/src%2Flibcollections%2Fslice.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/35fd1bab5e727061248c7810ca1fbe81e336d019/src%2Flibcollections%2Fslice.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Flibcollections%2Fslice.rs?ref=35fd1bab5e727061248c7810ca1fbe81e336d019", "patch": "@@ -1066,6 +1066,16 @@ fn merge_sort<T, F>(v: &mut [T], mut compare: F) where F: FnMut(&T, &T) -> Order\n                 let mut out = buf_tmp.offset(start as isize);\n                 let out_end = buf_tmp.offset(right_end_idx as isize);\n \n+                // if left[last] <= right[0], they are already in order:\n+                // fast-forward the left side (the right side is handled\n+                // in the loop).\n+                if compare(&*right.offset(-1), &*right) != Greater {\n+                    let elems = (right_start as usize - left as usize) / mem::size_of::<T>();\n+                    ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(&*left, out, elems);\n+                    out = out.offset(elems as isize);\n+                    left = right_start;\n+                }\n+\n                 while out < out_end {\n                     // Either the left or the right run are exhausted,\n                     // so just copy the remainder from the other run"}]}
