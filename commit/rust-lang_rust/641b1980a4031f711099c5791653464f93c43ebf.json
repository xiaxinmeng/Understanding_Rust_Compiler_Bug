~~~~\n \n-### Vector types\n+### Vector, Array, and Slice types\n \n-The vector type constructor represents a homogeneous array of values of a given type.\n-A vector has a fixed size.\n-(Operations like `vec.push` operate solely on owned vectors.)\n-A vector type can be annotated with a _definite_ size, such as `[int, ..10]`.\n-Such a definite-sized vector type is a first-class type, since its size is known statically.\n-A vector without such a size is said to be of _indefinite_ size,\n-and is therefore not a _first-class_ type.\n-An indefinite-size vector can only be instantiated through a pointer type,\n-such as `&[T]` or `Vec<T>`.\n-The kind of a vector type depends on the kind of its element type,\n-as with other simple structural types.\n+Rust has three different types for a list of items:\n \n-Expressions producing vectors of definite size cannot be evaluated in a\n-context expecting a vector of indefinite size; one must copy the\n-definite-sized vector contents into a distinct vector of indefinite size.\n+* `Vec<T>`, a 'vector'\n+* `[T ..N]`, an 'array'\n+* `&[T]`, a 'slice'.\n \n-An example of a vector type and its use:\n+A vector is a heap-allocated list of `T`. A vector has ownership over the data\n+inside of it. It is also able to grow and change in size. It's important to note\n+that `Vec<T>` is a library type, it's not actually part of the core language.\n \n-~~~~\n-let v: &[int] = &[7, 5, 3];\n-let i: int = v[2];\n-assert!(i == 3);\n-~~~~\n+An array has a fixed size, and can be allocated on either the stack or the heap.\n+\n+A slice is a 'view' into a vector or array. It doesn't own the data it points\n+to, it borrows it.\n+\n+An example of each kind:\n+\n+```{rust}\n+let vec: Vec<int>  = vec![1, 2, 3];\n+let arr: [int, ..3] = [1, 2, 3];\n+let s: &[int]      = vec.as_slice();\n+```\n+\n+As you can see, the `vec!` macro allows you to create a `Vec<T>` easily. The\n+`vec!` macro is also part of the standard library, rather than the language.\n \n-All in-bounds elements of a vector are always initialized,\n-and access to a vector is always bounds-checked.\n+All in-bounds elements of vectors, arrays, and slices are always initialized,\n+and access to a vector, array, or slice is always bounds-checked.\n \n ### Structure types\n "}]}
