These kinds of\n `enum`s are actually very useful and are even part of the standard library.\n \n+Enum variants are namespaced under the enum names.

We can use the `use` keyword to do something similar with `StringResult`:\n+\n+```rust\n+use StringResult::StringOK;\n+use StringResult::ErrorReason;\n+\n+enum StringResult {\n+    StringOK(String),\n+    ErrorReason(String),\n+}\n+\n+# fn main() {}\n+\n+fn respond(greeting: &str) -> StringResult {\n+    if greeting == \"Hello\" {\n+        StringOK(\"Good morning!\".to_string())\n+    } else {\n+        ErrorReason(\"I didn't understand you!\".to_string())\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+We'll learn more about `use` later, but it's used to bring names into scope. `use` declarations\n+must come before anything else, which looks a little strange in this example, since we `use`\n+the variants before we define them. Anyway, in the body of `respond`, we can just say `StringOK`\n+now, rather than the full `StringResult::StringOK`. Importing variants can be convenient, but can\n+also cause name conflicts, so do this with caution. It's considered good style to rarely import\n+variants for this reason.\n+\n As you can see `enum`s with values are quite a powerful tool for data representation,\n and can be even more useful when they're generic across types.
