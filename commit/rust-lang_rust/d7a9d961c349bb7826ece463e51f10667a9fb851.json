I'd definitely like to see this backported to beta.\n\nThe most urgent changes included here are:\n\n- Chapter 19.6, on macros (including the macro changes that just stabilized), [is cut off](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/issues/1668) because of an ill-placed newline in a comment that [pulldown-cmark interprets incorrectly](https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark/issues/124).\n- [The `Cargo.toml` shown in the Guessing Game example in Chapter 2 (and one in Chapter 14) doesn't have `edition=\"2018\"`](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/pull/1671), which can be confusing depending on whether the readers have it in theirs or not, think they should remove it if they have it, and the rest of the chapter assumes it's there and the code doesn't compile if you don't have it.\n- The redirects implemented as part of only shipping the 2018 edition of the book sometimes lead to [having to click through 2 redirect pages](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/pull/1667) when it could be just one.\n\nThere are other small corrections included that were made since the last time the book was updated, but those aren't urgent.\n\ncc @steveklabnik", "tree": {"sha": "0da12ab91e71a26e25ddf75f499addc7fc173083", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/0da12ab91e71a26e25ddf75f499addc7fc173083"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/d7a9d961c349bb7826ece463e51f10667a9fb851", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/d7a9d961c349bb7826ece463e51f10667a9fb851", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/d7a9d961c349bb7826ece463e51f10667a9fb851", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/d7a9d961c349bb7826ece463e51f10667a9fb851/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "8db23425a345381ec5f8d40e582c119a06b8cb3d", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/8db23425a345381ec5f8d40e582c119a06b8cb3d", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/8db23425a345381ec5f8d40e582c119a06b8cb3d"}, {"sha": "9d75198852e752992a00de71dbfedc0732a7b159", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/9d75198852e752992a00de71dbfedc0732a7b159", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/9d75198852e752992a00de71dbfedc0732a7b159"}], "stats": {"total": 2, "additions": 1, "deletions": 1}, "files": [{"sha": "74d81d80052cb88925f0e73b12fbd0b73ab7b5a0", "filename": "src/doc/book", "status": "modified", "additions": 1, "deletions": 1, "changes": 2, "blob_url": null, "raw_url": null, "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Fdoc%2Fbook?ref=d7a9d961c349bb7826ece463e51f10667a9fb851", "patch": "@@ -1 +1 @@\n-Subproject commit 616fe4172b688393aeee5f34935cc25733c9c062\n+Subproject commit 74d81d80052cb88925f0e73b12fbd0b73ab7b5a0"}]}
