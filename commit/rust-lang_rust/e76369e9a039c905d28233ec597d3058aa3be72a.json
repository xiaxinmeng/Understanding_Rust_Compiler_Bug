Here's how it works: Our program will generate a random\n+integer between one and a hundred.

Once we\n+guess correctly, it will congratulate us, and print the number of guesses we've\n+taken to the screen. Sound good? It sounds easy, but it'll end up showing off a\n+number of basic features of Rust.\n \n-comments\n+### Set up\n \n-## Testing\n+Let's set up a new project.

Let's just make it hello world for now, so we\n+can check that our setup works. In `src/guessing_game.rs`:\n+\n+```{rust}\n+fn main() {\n+    println!(\"Hello world!\");\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Let's make sure that worked:\n+\n+```{bash}\n+$ cargo build\n+   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:/home/you/projects/guessing_game)\n+$\n+```\n+\n+Excellent! Open up your `src/guessing_game.rs` again. We'll be writing all of\n+our code in this file. The next section of the tutorial will show you how to\n+build multiple-file projects.\n+\n+## Variable bindings\n+\n+The first thing we'll learn about are 'variable bindings.' They look like this:\n+\n+```{rust}\n+let x = 5i;\n+```\n+\n+In many languages, this is called a 'variable.' But Rust's variable bindings\n+have a few tricks up their sleeves. Rust has a very powerful feature called\n+'pattern matching' that we'll get into detail with later, but the left\n+hand side of a `let` expression is a full pattern, not just a variable name.\n+This means we can do things like:\n+\n+```{rust}\n+let (x, y) = (1i, 2i);\n+```\n+\n+After this expression is evaluated, `x` will be one, and `y` will be two.\n+Patterns are really powerful, but this is about all we can do with them so far.\n+So let's just keep this in the back of our minds as we go forward.\n+\n+By the way, in these examples, `i` indicates that the number is an integer.\n+\n+Rust is a statically typed language, which means that we specify our types up\n+front. So why does our first example compile? Well, Rust has this thing called\n+\"[Hindley-Milner type\n+inference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system)\",\n+named after some really smart type theorists. If you clicked that link, don't\n+be scared: what this means for you is that Rust will attempt to infer the types\n+in your program, and it's pretty good at it. If it can infer the type, Rust\n+doesn't require you to actually type it out.\n+\n+We can add the type if we want to. Types come after a colon (`:`):\n+\n+```{rust}\n+let x: int = 5;\n+```\n+\n+If I asked you to read this out loud to the rest of the class, you'd say \"`x`\n+is a binding with the type `int` and the value `five`.\" Rust requires you to\n+initialize the binding with a value before you're allowed to use it. If\n+we try...\n+\n+```{ignore}\n+let x;\n+```\n+\n+...we'll get an error:\n+\n+```{ignore}\n+src/guessing_game.rs:2:9: 2:10 error: cannot determine a type for this local variable: unconstrained type\n+src/guessing_game.rs:2     let x;\n+                               ^\n+```\n+\n+Giving it a type will compile, though:\n+\n+```{ignore}\n+let x: int;\n+```\n+\n+Let's try it out.

So why let us\n+declare a binding without initializing it? You'd think our first example would\n+have errored. Well, Rust is smarter than that. Before we get to that, let's talk\n+about this stuff we've added to `println!`.\n+\n+If you include two curly braces (`{}`, some call them moustaches...) in your\n+string to print, Rust will interpret this as a request to interpolate some sort\n+of value. **String interpolation** is a computer science term that means \"stick\n+in the middle of a string.\" We add a comma, and then `x`, to indicate that we\n+want `x` to be the value we're interpolating. The comma is used to separate\n+arguments we pass to functions and macros, if you're passing more than one.\n+\n+When you just use the double curly braces, Rust will attempt to display the\n+value in a meaningful way by checking out its type. If you want to specify the\n+format in a more detailed manner, there are a [wide number of options\n+available](/std/fmt/index.html). Fow now, we'll just stick to the default:\n+integers aren't very complicated to print.\n+\n+So, we've cleared up all of the confusion around bindings, with one exception:\n+why does Rust let us declare a variable binding without an initial value if we\n+must initialize the binding before we use it? And how does it know that we have\n+or have not initialized the binding? For that, we need to learn our next\n+concept: `if`.\n+\n+## If\n+\n+## Functions\n+\n+return\n+\n+comments\n \n ## Compound Data Types\n \n@@ -451,10 +637,35 @@ loop\n \n break/continue\n \n-iterators\n+## Guessing Game: complete\n+\n+At this point, you have successfully built the Guessing Game!
