With the additional requirement that, if possible, it would offer a way to record non-owned data without adding many `generic_activity_with_arg_{...}`-style methods. This lead to the `generic_activity_with_arg_recorder` single entry-point, and the closure parameter would offer the new methods, able to be executed in a context where costly argument could be created without disturbing the profiled piece of code.\n- some facilities/patterns allowing to record more rustc specific data in this situation, without making `rustc_data_structures`  where the self-profiler is defined, depend on other rustc crates (causing circular dependencies): in particular, spans. They are quite tricky to turn into strings (if the default `Debug` impl output does not match the context one needs them for), and since I'd also like to avoid the allocation there when arg recording is turned off today, that has turned into another flexibility requirement for the API in this PR (separating the span-specific recording into an extension trait). **edit**: I've removed this from the PR so that it's easier to review, and opened https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95739.\n- allow for extensibility in the future: other ways to record arguments, or additional data attached to them could be added in the future (e.g. recording the argument's name as well as its data).\n\nSome areas where I'd love feedback:\n- the API and names: the `EventArgRecorder` and its method for example. As well as the verbosity that comes from the increased flexibility.\n- if I should convert the existing `generic_activity_with_arg{s}` to just forward to `generic_activity_with_arg_recorder` + `recorder.record_arg` (or remove them altogether ? Probably not): I've used the new API in the simple case I could find of allocating for an arg that may not be recorded, and the rest don't seem costly.\n- [x] whether this API should panic if no arguments were recorded by the user-provided closure (like this PR currently does: it seems like an error to use an API dedicated to record arguments but not call the methods to then do so) or if this should just record a generic activity without arguments ?\n- whether the `record_arg` function should be `#[inline(always)]`, like the `generic_activity_*` functions ?\n\nAs mentioned, r? `@wesleywiser` following our recent discussion.", "tree": {"sha": "d46e64700d2f312d4f24f31d9290696330fbcb94", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/d46e64700d2f312d4f24f31d9290696330fbcb94"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/21be9da2099cb3c95ce8b7cef31ab77686775639", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/21be9da2099cb3c95ce8b7cef31ab77686775639", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/21be9da2099cb3c95ce8b7cef31ab77686775639", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/21be9da2099cb3c95ce8b7cef31ab77686775639/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "0e31b921120ee2880826231becb230570166ee18", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/0e31b921120ee2880826231becb230570166ee18", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/0e31b921120ee2880826231becb230570166ee18"}, {"sha": "c59b01f24189de0e988c4ead5ec3260ff05d484d", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/c59b01f24189de0e988c4ead5ec3260ff05d484d", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c59b01f24189de0e988c4ead5ec3260ff05d484d"}], "stats": {"total": 2, "additions": 1, "deletions": 1}, "files": [{"sha": "efcf18d31eb09a69d345f94f5081b16b3612a20c", "filename": "src/back/write.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 1, "deletions": 1, "changes": 2, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/21be9da2099cb3c95ce8b7cef31ab77686775639/src%2Fback%2Fwrite.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/21be9da2099cb3c95ce8b7cef31ab77686775639/src%2Fback%2Fwrite.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Fback%2Fwrite.rs?ref=21be9da2099cb3c95ce8b7cef31ab77686775639", "patch": "@@ -11,7 +11,7 @@ use rustc_target::spec::SplitDebuginfo;\n use crate::{GccCodegenBackend, GccContext};\n \n pub(crate) unsafe fn codegen(cgcx: &CodegenContext<GccCodegenBackend>, _diag_handler: &Handler, module: ModuleCodegen<GccContext>, config: &ModuleConfig) -> Result<CompiledModule, FatalError> {\n-    let _timer = cgcx.prof.generic_activity_with_arg(\"LLVM_module_codegen\", &module.name[..]);\n+    let _timer = cgcx.prof.generic_activity_with_arg(\"LLVM_module_codegen\", &*module.name);\n     {\n         let context = &module.module_llvm.context;\n "}]}
