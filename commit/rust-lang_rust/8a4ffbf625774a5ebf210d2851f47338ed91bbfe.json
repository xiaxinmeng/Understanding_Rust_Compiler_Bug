Right?\n+\n+This concept applies directly to Rust code as well:\n+some code \"owns\" a particular pointer to memory.\n+It's the sole owner of that pointer.\n+It can also lend that memory out to some other code for a while:\n+that code \"borrows\" the memory,\n+and it borrows it for a precise period of time,\n+called a \"lifetime.\"\n+\n+That's all there is to it.\n+That doesn't seem so hard, right?\n+Let's go back to that error message:\n+`error: 'i' does not live long enough`.\n+We tried to loan out a particular variable, `i`,\n+using a reference (the `&` operator) but Rust knew that the variable would be invalid after the function returns,\n+and so it tells us that:\n+`reference must be valid for the anonymous lifetime #1...`.\n+Neat!\n+\n+That's a great example for stack memory,\n+but what about heap memory?\n+Rust has a second kind of pointer,\n+an 'owned box',\n+that you can create with a `~`.\n+Check it out:\n+\n+```\n+fn dangling() -> ~int {\n+    let i = ~1234;\n+    return i;\n+}\n+\n+fn add_one() -> int {\n+    let num = dangling();\n+    return *num + 1;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Now instead of a stack allocated `1234`,\n+we have a heap allocated `~1234`.\n+Whereas `&` borrows a pointer to existing memory,\n+creating an owned box allocates memory on the heap and places a value in it,\n+giving you the sole pointer to that memory.\n+You can roughly compare these two lines:\n+\n+```\n+// Rust\n+let i = ~1234;\n+```\n+\n+```notrust\n+// C++\n+int *i = new int;\n+*i = 1234;\n+```\n+\n+Rust infers the correct type,\n+allocates the correct amount of memory and sets it to the value you asked for.\n+This means that it's impossible to allocate uninitialized memory:\n+*Rust does not have the concept of null*.\n+Hooray!\n+There's one other difference between this line of Rust and the C++:\n+The Rust compiler also figures out the lifetime of `i`,\n+and then inserts a corresponding `free` call after it's invalid,\n+like a destructor in C++.\n+You get all of the benefits of manually allocated heap memory without having to do all the bookkeeping yourself.\n+Furthermore, all of this checking is done at compile time,\n+so there's no runtime overhead.\n+You'll get (basically) the exact same code that you'd get if you wrote the correct C++,\n+but it's impossible to write the incorrect version, thanks to the compiler.\n+\n+You've seen one way that ownership and borrowing are useful to prevent code that would normally be dangerous in a less-strict language,\n+but let's talk about another: concurrency.\n+\n+# Owning concurrency\n+\n+Concurrency is an incredibly hot topic in the software world right now.\n+It's always been an interesting area of study for computer scientists,\n+but as usage of the Internet explodes,\n+people are looking to improve the number of users a given service can handle.\n+Concurrency is one way of achieving this goal.\n+There is a pretty big drawback to concurrent code, though:\n+it can be hard to reason about, because it is non-deterministic.\n+There are a few different approaches to writing good concurrent code,\n+but let's talk about how Rust's notions of ownership and lifetimes contribute to correct but concurrent code.\n+\n+First, let's go over a simple concurrency example.\n+Rust makes it easy to create \"tasks\",\n+otherwise known as \"threads\".\n+Typically, tasks do not share memory but instead communicate amongst each other with 'channels', like this:\n+\n+```\n+fn main() {\n+    let numbers = ~[1,2,3];\n+\n+    let (tx, rx)  = channel();\n+    tx.send(numbers);\n+\n+    spawn(proc() {\n+        let numbers = rx.recv();\n+        println!(\"{}\", numbers[0]);\n+    })\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In this example, we create a boxed array of numbers.\n+We then make a 'channel',\n+Rust's primary means of passing messages between tasks.\n+The `channel` function returns two different ends of the channel:\n+a `Sender` and `Receiver` (commonly abbreviated `tx` and `rx`).\n+The `spawn` function spins up a new task,\n+given a *heap allocated closure* to run.\n+As you can see in the code,\n+we call `chan.send()` from the original task,\n+passing in our boxed array,\n+and we call `rx.recv()` (short for 'receive') inside of the new task:\n+values given to the `Sender` via the `send` method come out the other end via the `recv` method on the `Receiver`.\n+\n+Now here's the exciting part:\n+because `numbers` is an owned type,\n+when it is sent across the channel,\n+it is actually *moved*,\n+transfering ownership of `numbers` between tasks.\n+This ownership transfer is *very fast* -\n+in this case simply copying a pointer -\n+while also ensuring that the original owning task cannot create data races by continuing to read or write to `numbers` in parallel with the new owner.\n+\n+To prove that Rust performs the ownership transfer,\n+try to modify the previous example to continue using the variable `numbers`:\n+\n+```ignore\n+fn main() {\n+    let numbers = ~[1,2,3];\n+\n+    let (tx, rx)  = channel();\n+    tx.send(numbers);\n+\n+    spawn(proc() {\n+        let numbers = rx.recv();\n+        println!(\"{}\", numbers[0]);\n+    });\n+\n+    // Try to print a number from the original task\n+    println!(\"{}\", numbers[0]);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This will result an error indicating that the value is no longer in scope:\n+\n+```notrust\n+concurrency.rs:12:20: 12:27 error: use of moved value: 'numbers'\n+concurrency.rs:12     println!(\"{}\", numbers[0]);\n+                                     ^~~~~~~\n+```\n+\n+Since only one task can own a boxed array at a time,\n+if instead of distributing our `numbers` array to a single task we wanted to distribute it to many tasks,\n+we would need to copy the array for each.\n+Let's see an example that uses the `clone` method to create copies of the data:\n+\n+```\n+fn main() {\n+    let numbers = ~[1,2,3];\n+\n+    for num in range(0, 3) {\n+        let (tx, rx)  = channel();\n+        // Use `clone` to send a *copy* of the array\n+        tx.send(numbers.clone());\n+\n+        spawn(proc() {\n+            let numbers = rx.recv();\n+            println!(\"{:d}\", numbers[num as uint]);\n+        })\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This is similar to the code we had before,\n+except now we loop three times,\n+making three tasks,\n+and *cloning* `numbers` before sending it.\n+\n+However, if we're making a lot of tasks,\n+or if our data is very large,\n+creating a copy for each task requires a lot of work and a lot of extra memory for little benefit.\n+In practice, we might not want to do this because of the cost.\n+Enter `Arc`,\n+an atomically reference counted box (\"A.R.C.\" == \"atomically reference counted\").\n+`Arc` is the most common way to *share* data between tasks.\n+Here's some code:\n+\n+```\n+extern crate sync;\n+use sync::Arc;\n+\n+fn main() {\n+    let numbers = ~[1,2,3];\n+    let numbers = Arc::new(numbers);\n+\n+    for num in range(0, 3) {\n+        let (tx, rx)  = channel();\n+        tx.send(numbers.clone());\n+\n+        spawn(proc() {\n+            let numbers = rx.recv();\n+            println!(\"{:d}\", numbers[num as uint]);\n+        })\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This is almost exactly the same,\n+except that this time `numbers` is first put into an `Arc`.\n+`Arc::new` creates the `Arc`,\n+`.clone()` makes another `Arc` that referrs to the same contents.\n+So we clone the `Arc` for each task,\n+send that clone down the channel,\n+and then use it to print out a number.\n+Now instead of copying an entire array to send it to our multiple tasks we are just copying a pointer (the `Arc`) and *sharing* the array.\n+\n+How can this work though?\n+Surely if we're sharing data then can't we cause data races if one task writes to the array while others read?\n+\n+Well, Rust is super-smart and will only let you put data into an `Arc` that is provably safe to share.\n+In this case, it's safe to share the array *as long as it's immutable*,\n+i.e. many tasks may read the data in parallel as long as none can write.\n+So for this type and many others `Arc` will only give you an immutable view of the data.\n+\n+Arcs are great for immutable data,\n+but what about mutable data?\n+Shared mutable state is the bane of the concurrent programmer:\n+you can use a mutex to protect shared mutable state,\n+but if you forget to acquire the mutex, bad things can happen, including crashes.\n+Rust provides mutexes but makes it impossible to use them in a way that subverts memory safety.\n+\n+Let's take the same example yet again,\n+and modify it to mutate the shared state:\n+\n+```\n+extern crate sync;\n+use sync::{Arc, Mutex};\n+\n+fn main() {\n+    let numbers = ~[1,2,3];\n+    let numbers_lock = Arc::new(Mutex::new(numbers));\n+\n+    for num in range(0, 3) {\n+        let (tx, rx)  = channel();\n+        tx.send(numbers_lock.clone());\n+\n+        spawn(proc() {\n+            let numbers_lock = rx.recv();\n+\n+            // Take the lock, along with exclusive access to the underlying array\n+            let mut numbers = numbers_lock.lock();\n+            numbers[num as uint] += 1;\n+\n+            println!(\"{}\", numbers[num as uint]);\n+\n+            // When `numbers` goes out of scope the lock is dropped\n+        })\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This example is starting to get more subtle,\n+but it hints at the powerful compositionality of Rust's concurrent types.\n+This time we've put our array of numbers inside a `Mutex` and then put *that* inside the `Arc`.\n+Like immutable data,\n+`Mutex`es are sharable,\n+but unlike immutable data,\n+data inside a `Mutex` may be mutated as long as the mutex is locked.\n+\n+The `lock` method here returns not your original array or a pointer thereof,\n+but a `MutexGuard`,\n+a type that is responsible for releasing the lock when it goes out of scope.\n+This same `MutexGuard` can transparently be treated as if it were the value the `Mutex` contains,\n+as you can see in the subsequent indexing operation that performs the mutation.\n+\n+OK, let's stop there before we get too deep.\n+\n+# A footnote: unsafe\n+\n+The Rust compiler and libraries are entirely written in Rust;\n+we say that Rust is \"self-hosting\".\n+If Rust makes it impossible to unsafely share data between threads,\n+and Rust is written in Rust,\n+then how does it implement concurrent types like `Arc` and `Mutex`?\n+The answer: `unsafe`.\n+\n+You see, while the Rust compiler is very smart,\n+and saves you from making mistakes you might normally make,\n+it's not an artificial intelligence.\n+Because we're smarter than the compiler -\n+sometimes - we need to over-ride this safe behavior.\n+For this purpose, Rust has an `unsafe` keyword.\n+Within an `unsafe` block,\n+Rust turns off many of its safety checks.\n+If something bad happens to your program,\n+you only have to audit what you've done inside `unsafe`,\n+and not the entire program itself.\n+\n+If one of the major goals of Rust was safety,\n+why allow that safety to be turned off?\n+Well, there are really only three main reasons to do it:\n+interfacing with external code,\n+such as doing FFI into a C library;\n+performance (in certain cases);\n+and to provide a safe abstraction around operations that normally would not be safe.\n+Our `Arc`s are an example of this last purpose.\n+We can safely hand out multiple pointers to the contents of the `Arc`,\n+because we are sure the data is safe to share.\n+But the Rust compiler can't know that we've made these choices,\n+so _inside_ the implementation of the Arcs,\n+we use `unsafe` blocks to do (normally) dangerous things.\n+But we expose a safe interface,\n+which means that the `Arc`s are impossible to use incorrectly.\n+\n+This is how Rust's type system prevents you from making some of the mistakes that make concurrent programming difficult,\n+yet get the efficiency of languages such as C++.\n+\n+# That's all, folks\n+\n+I hope that this taste of Rust has given you an idea if Rust is the right language for you.\n+If that's true,\n+I encourage you to check out [the tutorial](tutorial.html) for a full,\n+in-depth exploration of Rust's syntax and concepts."}]}
