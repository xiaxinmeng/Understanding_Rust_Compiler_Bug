A detailed investigation can be found [on\r\ngithub][details], but the tl;dr is that we need to stop applying dllimport so\r\naggressively.\r\n\r\nThis commit alters the application of dllimport on constants to only cases where\r\nthe crate the constant originated from will be linked as a dylib in some output\r\ncrate type. That way if we're just linking rlibs (like the motivation for this\r\nissue) we won't use dllimport. For the compiler, however, (which has lots of\r\ndylibs) we'll use dllimport.\r\n\r\n[details]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26591#issuecomment-123513631\r\n\r\ncc #26591", "tree": {"sha": "e14617f6387d8cb9086afc91ed1677050e7f624f", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/e14617f6387d8cb9086afc91ed1677050e7f624f"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/c9ef1a5c19b8f9a254b0fb0b79a3bebf0722a9ce", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/c9ef1a5c19b8f9a254b0fb0b79a3bebf0722a9ce", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c9ef1a5c19b8f9a254b0fb0b79a3bebf0722a9ce", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/c9ef1a5c19b8f9a254b0fb0b79a3bebf0722a9ce/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "68e0d13bfdcb83bfd4232ad33a1a7e271bff8994", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/68e0d13bfdcb83bfd4232ad33a1a7e271bff8994", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/68e0d13bfdcb83bfd4232ad33a1a7e271bff8994"}, {"sha": "a0efd3a3d99a98e3399a4f07abe6a67cf0660335", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/a0efd3a3d99a98e3399a4f07abe6a67cf0660335", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/a0efd3a3d99a98e3399a4f07abe6a67cf0660335"}], "stats": {"total": 94, "additions": 93, "deletions": 1}, "files": [{"sha": "258051357b1057b21ab41be45deba19a7f00ba11", "filename": "src/librustc_trans/trans/base.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 37, "deletions": 1, "changes": 38, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/c9ef1a5c19b8f9a254b0fb0b79a3bebf0722a9ce/src%2Flibrustc_trans%2Ftrans%2Fbase.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/c9ef1a5c19b8f9a254b0fb0b79a3bebf0722a9ce/src%2Flibrustc_trans%2Ftrans%2Fbase.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Flibrustc_trans%2Ftrans%2Fbase.rs?ref=c9ef1a5c19b8f9a254b0fb0b79a3bebf0722a9ce", "patch": "@@ -228,6 +228,7 @@ pub fn get_extern_const<'a, 'tcx>(ccx: &CrateContext<'a, 'tcx>, did: ast::DefId,\n     // FIXME(nagisa): perhaps the map of externs could be offloaded to llvm somehow?\n     // FIXME(nagisa): investigate whether it can be changed into define_global\n     let c = declare::declare_global(ccx, &name[..], ty);\n+\n     // Thread-local statics in some other crate need to *always* be linked\n     // against in a thread-local fashion, so we need to be sure to apply the\n     // thread-local attribute locally if it was present remotely.
