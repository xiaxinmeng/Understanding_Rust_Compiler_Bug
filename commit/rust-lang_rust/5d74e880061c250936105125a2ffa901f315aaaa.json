In actuality that's not the\ncase, every element is tried regardless of what happened with the previous\nelement.\n\nThis change tries to clarify that by removing the uses of \"try again\"\naltogether.", "tree": {"sha": "dd021ddcf29917641dc01f62aedc1fb33f9e6432", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/dd021ddcf29917641dc01f62aedc1fb33f9e6432"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/5d74e880061c250936105125a2ffa901f315aaaa", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/5d74e880061c250936105125a2ffa901f315aaaa", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/5d74e880061c250936105125a2ffa901f315aaaa", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/5d74e880061c250936105125a2ffa901f315aaaa/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "ac892a12743551c98da1d4b8c6366e285a10833f", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/ac892a12743551c98da1d4b8c6366e285a10833f", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/ac892a12743551c98da1d4b8c6366e285a10833f"}, {"sha": "8af85fa1f73428888730b05e48291c73897dd44d", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/8af85fa1f73428888730b05e48291c73897dd44d", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/8af85fa1f73428888730b05e48291c73897dd44d"}], "stats": {"total": 26, "additions": 8, "deletions": 18}, "files": [{"sha": "b5aa7257cf38ef876157abde6919674e9f196daf", "filename": "library/core/src/iter/traits/iterator.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 8, "deletions": 18, "changes": 26, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5d74e880061c250936105125a2ffa901f315aaaa/library%2Fcore%2Fsrc%2Fiter%2Ftraits%2Fiterator.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/5d74e880061c250936105125a2ffa901f315aaaa/library%2Fcore%2Fsrc%2Fiter%2Ftraits%2Fiterator.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/library%2Fcore%2Fsrc%2Fiter%2Ftraits%2Fiterator.rs?ref=5d74e880061c250936105125a2ffa901f315aaaa", "patch": "@@ -648,11 +648,9 @@ pub trait Iterator {\n     /// Creates an iterator which uses a closure to determine if an element\n     /// should be yielded.\n     ///\n-    /// The closure must return `true` or `false`. `filter()` creates an\n-    /// iterator which calls this closure on each element.
