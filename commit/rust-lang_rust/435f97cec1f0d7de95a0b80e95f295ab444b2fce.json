In practice,\nwe do test tools as well, so for those tools we would initially record them as being\nTestPass, and then later on re-record the correct state after actually testing them.\nHowever, this would not work well if the build failed for whatever reason (e.g. panicking\nin bootstrap, or as was the case in #73097, clippy failing to test successfully), we would\njust go on believing that things passed when they in practice did not.\n\nThis commit also adjusts saving toolstate to never record clippy explicitly (otherwise, it\nwould be recorded when building it); eventually that'll likely move to other tools as well\nbut not yet. This is deemed simpler than checking everywhere we generically save\ntoolstate.\n\nWe also move clippy out of the \"toolstate\" no-fail-fast build into a separate x.py\ninvocation; this should no longer be technically required but provides the nice state of\nletting us check toolstate for all tools and only then check clippy (giving full results\non every build).\n\nr?
