Sometimes it\n+enters directly into the composition of the events, while sometimes it\n+relates only to their fortuitous position among persons and\n+places. The latter sort is splendidly exemplified by a case in the\n+ancient city of Providence, where in the late forties Edgar Allan Poe\n+used to sojourn often during his unsuccessful wooing of the gifted\n+poetess, Mrs.  Whitman. Poe generally stopped at the Mansion House in\n+Benefit Street--the renamed Golden Ball Inn whose roof has sheltered\n+Washington, Jefferson, and Lafayette--and his favorite walk led\n+northward along the same street to Mrs. Whitman's home and the\n+neighboring hillside churchyard of St. John's, whose hidden expanse of\n+Eighteenth Century gravestones had for him a peculiar fascination.\n+\n+\")]\n+iface the_shunned_house {\n+    #[doc(\n+        desc = \"\n+\n+    Now the irony is this. In this walk, so many times repeated, the\n+    world's greatest master of the terrible and the bizarre was\n+    obliged to pass a particular house on the eastern side of the\n+    street; a dingy, antiquated structure perched on the abruptly\n+    rising side hill, with a great unkempt yard dating from a time\n+    when the region was partly open country. It does not appear that\n+    he ever wrote or spoke of it, nor is there any evidence that he\n+    even noticed it. And yet that house, to the two persons in\n+    possession of certain information, equals or outranks in horror\n+    the wildest fantasy of the genius who so often passed it\n+    unknowingly, and stands starkly leering as a symbol of all that is\n+    unutterably hideous.\n+\n+    \",\n+        args(\n+            a =\n+            \"A yard dating from a time when the region was partly\n+             open country\"\n+    ))]\n+    fn dingy_house(unkempt_yard: int);\n+\n+    #[doc(\n+        desc = \"\n+\n+    The house was--and for that matter still is--of a kind to attract\n+    the attention of the curious.

It faced south, with one gable end buried to the\n+    lower windows in the eastward rising hill, and the other exposed\n+    to the foundations toward the street.
