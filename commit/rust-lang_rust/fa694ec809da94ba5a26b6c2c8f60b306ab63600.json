There's no need to be mean or rude.\n-* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and\n-  numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.\n-* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and\n-  see how it works.\n-* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We\n-  interpret the term \"harassment\" as including the definition in the <a href=\"http://citizencodeofconduct.org/\">Citizen\n-  Code of Conduct</a>; if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their\n-  definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.\n-* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or\n-  made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the [Rust moderation\n-  team][mod_team] immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a\n-  safe place for you and we've got your back.\n-* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.\n-\n-## Moderation\n-\n-\n-These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct. If you feel that a thread needs moderation,\n-please contact the [Rust moderation team][mod_team].\n-\n-1. Remarks that violate the Rust standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks,\n-   are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)\n-2. Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.\n-3. Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.\n-4. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be \"kicked,\" i.e., kicked out of the communication channel to cool off.\n-5. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.\n-6. Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended\n-   party a genuine apology.\n-7. If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a\n-   different moderator, **in private**. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.\n-8. Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate\n-   situation, they should expect less leeway than others.\n-\n-In the Rust community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don't just aim to be technically\n-unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly\n-if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can\n-drive people away from the community entirely.\n-\n-And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was\n-they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good\n-there was something you could've communicated better \u2014 remember that it's your responsibility to make your fellow\n-Rustaceans comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about\n-cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their\n-trust.\n-\n-The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official Rust venues; including official IRC channels (#rust,\n-#rust-internals, #rust-tools, #rust-libs, #rustc, #rust-beginners, #rust-docs, #rust-community, #rust-lang, and #cargo);\n-GitHub repositories under rust-lang, rust-lang-nursery, and rust-lang-deprecated; and all forums under rust-lang.org\n-(users.rust-lang.org, internals.rust-lang.org). For other projects adopting the Rust Code of Conduct, please contact the\n-maintainers of those projects for enforcement. If you wish to use this code of conduct for your own project, consider\n-explicitly mentioning your moderation policy or making a copy with your own moderation policy so as to avoid confusion.\n-\n-*Adapted from the [Node.js Policy on Trolling](http://blog.izs.me/post/30036893703/policy-on-trolling) as well as the\n-[Contributor Covenant v1.3.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/).*\n-\n-[mod_team]: https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html#Moderation-team\n+The Code of Conduct for this repository [can be found online](https://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html)."}]}
