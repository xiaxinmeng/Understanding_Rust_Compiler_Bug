This is often used so that you don\u2019t need to come up with two unique names.\r\n\r\nYou already said something similar to this in the Guessing Game, but maybe you intended for this example to be independent of that one.\r\n\r\n2) In \"Rust Inside Other Languages,\" you introduce the idea of the \"global interpreter lock\" and then refer to it as the GIL a few paragraphs later without explicitly stating that GIL == global interpreter lock. It's reasonable to expect readers to make the connection, but maybe that's not what you intended.\r\n\r\nExcellent work on the examples!
