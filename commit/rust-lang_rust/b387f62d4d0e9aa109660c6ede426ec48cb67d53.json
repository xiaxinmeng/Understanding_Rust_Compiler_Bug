We currently do not have a method to modify that item, which we could easily add via a `peek_mut()`. See the test for a use-case (alike to my original use case), where a \"pristine\" iterator is passed on after modifying its state via `peek_mut()`.\n\nIf there is interest in this, I can expand on the tests and docs.", "tree": {"sha": "a70c80f6e2ec478f15b7daf97a7d9089c50939fe", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/a70c80f6e2ec478f15b7daf97a7d9089c50939fe"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/b387f62d4d0e9aa109660c6ede426ec48cb67d53", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/b387f62d4d0e9aa109660c6ede426ec48cb67d53", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/b387f62d4d0e9aa109660c6ede426ec48cb67d53", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/b387f62d4d0e9aa109660c6ede426ec48cb67d53/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "3f7ccb4cf59ba79a656f07179aac36e4580a8706", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/3f7ccb4cf59ba79a656f07179aac36e4580a8706", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/3f7ccb4cf59ba79a656f07179aac36e4580a8706"}, {"sha": "3b015622be1245d00e2663ba3da38a00ceb583fb", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/3b015622be1245d00e2663ba3da38a00ceb583fb", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/3b015622be1245d00e2663ba3da38a00ceb583fb"}], "stats": {"total": 49, "additions": 49, "deletions": 0}, "files": [{"sha": "ebdc2555db27a3f4e9c344f30dd15369b2097ddc", "filename": "library/core/src/iter/adapters/peekable.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 37, "deletions": 0, "changes": 37, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b387f62d4d0e9aa109660c6ede426ec48cb67d53/library%2Fcore%2Fsrc%2Fiter%2Fadapters%2Fpeekable.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/b387f62d4d0e9aa109660c6ede426ec48cb67d53/library%2Fcore%2Fsrc%2Fiter%2Fadapters%2Fpeekable.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/library%2Fcore%2Fsrc%2Fiter%2Fadapters%2Fpeekable.rs?ref=b387f62d4d0e9aa109660c6ede426ec48cb67d53", "patch": "@@ -216,6 +216,43 @@ impl<I: Iterator> Peekable<I> {\n         self.peeked.get_or_insert_with(|| iter.next()).as_ref()\n     }\n \n+    /// Returns a mutable reference to the next() value without advancing the iterator.\n+    ///\n+    /// Like [`next`], if there is a value, it is wrapped in a `Some(T)`.\n+    /// But if the iteration is over, `None` is returned.\n+    ///\n+    /// Because `peek_mut()` returns a reference, and many iterators iterate over\n+    /// references, there can be a possibly confusing situation where the\n+    /// return value is a double reference.
