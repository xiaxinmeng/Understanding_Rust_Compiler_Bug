Rust channels can be used as if they have an infinite internal buffer. What\n-//! this means is that the `send` operation will never block. `Receiver`s, on\n-//! the other hand, will block the task if there is no data to be received.\n+//! Rust channels come in one of two flavors:\n+//!\n+//! 1. An asynchronous, infinitely buffered channel. The `channel()` function\n+//!    will return a `(Sender, Receiver)` tuple where all sends will be\n+//!    **asynchronous** (they never block). The channel conceptually has an\n+//!    infinite buffer.\n+//!\n+//! 2. A synchronous, bounded channel. The `sync_channel()` function will return\n+//!    a `(SyncSender, Receiver)` tuple where the storage for pending messages\n+//!    is a pre-allocated buffer of a fixed size. All sends will be\n+//!    **synchronous** by blocking until there is buffer space available. Note\n+//!    that a bound of 0 is allowed, causing the channel to become a\n+//!    \"rendezvous\" channel where each sender atomically hands off a message to\n+//!    a receiver.\n //!\n //! ## Failure Propagation\n //!\n@@ -38,32 +51,40 @@\n //! `fail!`.

There are methods on both of senders and receivers to perform their\n //! respective operations without failing, however.\n //!\n-//! ## Outside the Runtime\n+//! ## Runtime Requirements\n //!\n-//! All channels and ports work seamlessly inside and outside of the rust\n-//! runtime. This means that code may use channels to communicate information\n-//! inside and outside of the runtime. For example, if rust were embedded as an\n-//! FFI module in another application, the rust runtime would probably be\n-//! running in its own external thread pool. Channels created can communicate\n-//! from the native application threads to the rust threads through the use of\n-//! native mutexes and condition variables.\n+//! The channel types defined in this module generally have very few runtime\n+//! requirements in order to operate. The major requirement they have is for a\n+//! local rust `Task` to be available if any *blocking* operation is performed.\n //!\n-//! What this means is that if a native thread is using a channel, execution\n-//! will be blocked accordingly by blocking the OS thread.\n+//! If a local `Task` is not available (for example an FFI callback), then the\n+//! `send` operation is safe on a `Sender` (as well as a `send_opt`) as well as\n+//! the `try_send` method on a `SyncSender`, but no other operations are\n+//! guaranteed to be safe.\n+//!\n+//! Additionally, channels can interoperate between runtimes. If one task in a\n+//! program is running on libnative and another is running on libgreen, they can\n+//! still communicate with one another using channels.\n //!\n //! # Example\n //!\n-//! ```rust,should_fail\n+//!
