While there have been a few 64bit SoCs that have\nbugs (#49281, #56940) which cause time to not monotonically increase, these have\nbeen fixed in the Linux kernel and we shouldn't penalize all Arm SoCs for those\nwho refuse to update their kernels:\nSUN50I_ERRATUM_UNKNOWN1 - Allwinner A64 / Pine A64 - fixed in 5.1\nFSL_ERRATUM_A008585 - Freescale LS2080A/LS1043A - fixed in 4.10\nHISILICON_ERRATUM_161010101 - Hisilicon 1610 - fixed in 4.11\nARM64_ERRATUM_858921 - Cortex A73 - fixed in 4.12\n\n255a3f3e183 std: Force `Instant::now()` to be monotonic added a Mutex to work around\nthis problem and a small test program using glommio shows the majority of time spent\nacquiring and releasing this Mutex. 3914a7b0da8 tries to improve this, but actually\nmakes it worse on big systems as for 128b atomics a ldxp/stxp pair (and successful loop)\nfor v8.4 systems that don't support FEAT_LSE2 is required which is expensive as a lock\nand because of how the load/store-exclusives scale on large Arm systems is both unfair\nto threads and tends to go backwards in performance.\n\nA small sample program using glommio improves by 70x on a 32 core Graviton2\nsystem with this
