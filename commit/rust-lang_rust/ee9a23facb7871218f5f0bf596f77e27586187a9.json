Next, we can use operators like `+` on them, and the appropriate SIMD instructions will be carried out. When we run `cargo run` you should get `[11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0]`.\n \n-Currently the crate is organized so that each element type is a file, and then the 64-bit, 128-bit, 256-bit, and 512-bit vectors using those types are contained in said file.\n+## Supported vectors\n \n-All types are then exported as a single, flat module.\n+Currently, vectors may have up to 64 elements, but aliases are provided only up to 512-bit vectors.\n \n Depending on the size of the primitive type, the number of lanes the vector will have varies. For example, 128-bit vectors have four `f32` lanes and two `f64` lanes.\n \n The supported element types are as follows:\n * **Floating Point:** `f32`, `f64`\n-* **Signed Integers:** `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `isize`\n-* **Unsigned Integers:** `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `usize`\n-* **Masks:** `mask8`, `mask16`, `mask32`, `mask64`, `mask128`, `masksize`\n+* **Signed Integers:** `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `isize` (`i128` excluded)\n+* **Unsigned Integers:** `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `usize` (`u128` excluded)\n+* **Masks:** 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, and `usize`-sized masks\n \n Floating point, signed integers, and unsigned integers are the [primitive types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/primitive/index.html) you're already used to.\n-The `mask` types are \"truthy\" values, but they use the number of bits in their name instead of just 1 bit like a normal `bool` uses.\n+The mask types are \"truthy\" values, like `bool`, but have an unspecified layout in the vector type and cannot be constructed outside of a vector.\n \n [simd-guide]: ./beginners-guide.md\n [zulip-project-portable-simd]: https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/257879-project-portable-simd"}]}
