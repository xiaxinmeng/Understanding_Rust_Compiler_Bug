In one other place I changed std::u8 to std::ops since it was just testing path handling in macros.\n\nFor places which have legitimate uses of the old consts, deprecated attributes have been optimistically inserted. Although currently unnecessary, they exist to emphasize to any future deprecation effort the necessity of these specific symbols and prevent them from being accidentally removed.", "tree": {"sha": "cf48488ccb4b997dc6317a7da59b3503c880a4bf", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/cf48488ccb4b997dc6317a7da59b3503c880a4bf"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/d55d791a3a5b1fb67966099ccb4a961d546e4ad6", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/d55d791a3a5b1fb67966099ccb4a961d546e4ad6", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/d55d791a3a5b1fb67966099ccb4a961d546e4ad6", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/d55d791a3a5b1fb67966099ccb4a961d546e4ad6/comments", "author": null, "committer": null, "parents": [{"sha": "5d585ec022a77ce724c0bf9c20333492532e9e49", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/5d585ec022a77ce724c0bf9c20333492532e9e49", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/5d585ec022a77ce724c0bf9c20333492532e9e49"}], "stats": {"total": 2, "additions": 1, "deletions": 1}, "files": [{"sha": "263d9a7b92ddb2edb65bacef04ee55ca3870e3ad", "filename": "tests/ui/float_cmp_const.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 1, "deletions": 1, "changes": 2, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/d55d791a3a5b1fb67966099ccb4a961d546e4ad6/tests%2Fui%2Ffloat_cmp_const.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/d55d791a3a5b1fb67966099ccb4a961d546e4ad6/tests%2Fui%2Ffloat_cmp_const.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/tests%2Fui%2Ffloat_cmp_const.rs?ref=d55d791a3a5b1fb67966099ccb4a961d546e4ad6", "patch": "@@ -48,7 +48,7 @@ fn main() {\n     v != 1.0;\n \n     const ZERO_ARRAY: [f32; 3] = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0];\n-    const ZERO_INF_ARRAY: [f32; 3] = [0.0, ::std::f32::INFINITY, ::std::f32::NEG_INFINITY];\n+    const ZERO_INF_ARRAY: [f32; 3] = [0.0, f32::INFINITY, f32::NEG_INFINITY];\n     const NON_ZERO_ARRAY: [f32; 3] = [0.0, 0.1, 0.2];\n     const NON_ZERO_ARRAY2: [f32; 3] = [0.2, 0.1, 0.0];\n "}]}
