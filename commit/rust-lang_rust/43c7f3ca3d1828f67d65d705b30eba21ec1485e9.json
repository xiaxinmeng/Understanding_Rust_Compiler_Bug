This commit removes the note that `rustup` can only install for the nightly branch and adjusts the command.\n\nI also added a note on how to find the path to the `rust-analyzer` binary when installed using `rustup`, and suggestions on how to work around it not being placed in `~/.cargo/bin`.\n\nI thought it would be ideal to point everyone to use `rustup run stable rust-analyzer` to start `rust-analyzer`. That would make it trivial to switch to nightly however I could not get this to work in `nvim` therefore I left it as a suggestion at the end.", "tree": {"sha": "bdf14db2d72856cfc0c16f2aefdf120572e5c442", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/bdf14db2d72856cfc0c16f2aefdf120572e5c442"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/43c7f3ca3d1828f67d65d705b30eba21ec1485e9", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/43c7f3ca3d1828f67d65d705b30eba21ec1485e9", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/43c7f3ca3d1828f67d65d705b30eba21ec1485e9", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/43c7f3ca3d1828f67d65d705b30eba21ec1485e9/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "d23537394e92e1abc864dc4cabdab14ad9b9c0c1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/d23537394e92e1abc864dc4cabdab14ad9b9c0c1", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/d23537394e92e1abc864dc4cabdab14ad9b9c0c1"}, {"sha": "76be44eed5e0fe1a80d642a31a4f0537e151f7fe", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/76be44eed5e0fe1a80d642a31a4f0537e151f7fe", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/76be44eed5e0fe1a80d642a31a4f0537e151f7fe"}], "stats": {"total": 17, "additions": 14, "deletions": 3}, "files": [{"sha": "c30838e5f5e1e09b10ac34ce19c718d195f67a07", "filename": "docs/user/manual.adoc", "status": "modified", "additions": 14, "deletions": 3, "changes": 17, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/43c7f3ca3d1828f67d65d705b30eba21ec1485e9/docs%2Fuser%2Fmanual.adoc", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/43c7f3ca3d1828f67d65d705b30eba21ec1485e9/docs%2Fuser%2Fmanual.adoc", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/docs%2Fuser%2Fmanual.adoc?ref=43c7f3ca3d1828f67d65d705b30eba21ec1485e9", "patch": "@@ -174,14 +174,25 @@ On Unix, running the editor from a shell or changing the `.desktop` file to set\n \n ==== `rustup`\n \n-`rust-analyzer` is available in `rustup`, but only in the nightly toolchain:\n+`rust-analyzer` is available in `rustup`:\n \n [source,bash]\n ----\n-$ rustup +nightly component add rust-analyzer-preview\n+$ rustup component add rust-analyzer\n ----\n \n-However, in contrast to `component add clippy` or `component add rustfmt`, this does not actually place a `rust-analyzer` binary in `~/.cargo/bin`, see https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/2411[this issue].\n+However, in contrast to `component add clippy` or `component add rustfmt`, this does not actually place a `rust-analyzer` binary in `~/.cargo/bin`, see https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/2411[this issue].
