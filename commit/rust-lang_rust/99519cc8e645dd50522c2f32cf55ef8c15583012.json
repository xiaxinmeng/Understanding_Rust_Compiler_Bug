Please open any\n issues you find as usual.\n </div>\n \n-Coming soon. :)\n+## Welcome!\n+\n+Hey there! Welcome to the Rust guide. This is the place to be if you'd like to\n+learn how to program in Rust. Rust is a systems programming language with a\n+focus on \"high-level, bare-metal programming\": the lowest level control a\n+programming language can give you, but with zero-cost, higher level\n+abstractions, because people aren't computers. We really think Rust is\n+something special, and we hope you do too.\n+\n+To show you how to get going with Rust, we're going to write the traditional\n+\"Hello, World!\" program. Next, we'll introduce you to a tool that's useful for\n+writing real-world Rust programs and libraries: \"Cargo.\" Then, we'll show off\n+Rust's features by writing a little program together.\n+\n+Sound good? Let's go!\n+\n+## Installing Rust\n+\n+The first step to using Rust is to install it! There are a number of ways to\n+install Rust, but the easiest is to use the the `rustup` script. If you're on\n+Linux or a Mac, All you need to do is this:\n+\n+```{ignore}\n+$ curl -s http://www.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sudo sh\n+```\n+\n+(If you're concerned about `curl | sudo sh`, please keep reading. Disclaimer\n+below.)\n+\n+If you're on Windows, please [download this .exe and run\n+it](http://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-nightly-install.exe).\n+\n+If you decide you don't want Rust anymore, we'll be a bit sad, but that's okay.\n+Not every programming language is great for everyone. Just pass an argument to\n+the script:\n+\n+```{ignore}\n+$ curl -s http://www.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sudo sh -s -- --uninstall\n+```\n+\n+If you used the Windows installer, just re-run the `.exe` and it will give you\n+an uninstall option.\n+\n+You can re-run this script any time you want to update Rust. Which, at this\n+point, is often. Rust is still pre-1.0, and so people assume that you're using\n+a very recent Rust. \n+\n+This brings me to one other point: some people, and somewhat rightfully so, get\n+very upset when we tell you to `curl | sudo sh`. And they should be! Basically,\n+when you do this, you are trusting that the good people who maintain Rust\n+aren't going to hack your computer and do bad things. That's a good instinct!\n+If you're one of those people, please check out the documentation on [building\n+Rust from Source](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust#building-from-source), or\n+[the official binary downloads](http://www.rust-lang.org/install.html). And we\n+promise that this method will not be the way to install Rust forever: it's just\n+the easiest way to keep people updated while Rust is in its alpha state.\n+\n+Oh, we should also mention the officially supported platforms:\n+\n+* Windows (7, 8, Server 2008 R2), x86 only\n+* Linux (2.6.18 or later, various distributions), x86 and x86-64\n+* OSX 10.7 (Lion) or greater, x86 and x86-64\n+\n+We extensively test Rust on these platforms, and a few others, too, like\n+Android. But these are the ones most likely to work, as they have the most\n+testing.\n+\n+Finally, a comment about Windows. Rust considers Windows to be a first-class\n+platform upon release, but if we're honest, the Windows experience isn't as\n+integrated as the Linux/OS X experience is. We're working on it! If anything\n+does not work, it is a bug. Please let us know if that happens. Each and every\n+commit is tested against Windows just like any other platform.\n+\n+If you've got Rust installed, you can open up a shell, and type this:\n+\n+```{ignore}\n+$ rustc --version\n+```\n+\n+You should see some output that looks something like this:\n+\n+```{ignore}\n+rustc 0.11.0-pre (443a1cd 2014-06-08 14:56:52 -0700)\n+host: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\n+```\n+\n+If you did, Rust has been installed successfully! Congrats!\n+\n+If not, there are a number of places where you can get help. The easiest is\n+IRC, which you can access\n+[here](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust). Click\n+that link, and you'll be chatting with other Rustaceans (a silly nickname we\n+call ourselves), and we can help you out. Other great resources include our\n+[mailing list](https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/rust-dev),\n+[subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/rust), and\n+[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust).\n+\n+## Hello, world!\n+\n+## Hello, Cargo!"}]}
