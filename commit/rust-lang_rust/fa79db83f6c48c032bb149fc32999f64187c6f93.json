I've not yet had the chance to fix this and release a new patch. So, in order to benefit from the changes to reduce generated code, you'll need to wait until there's a new version of tracing as well as tracing-attributes and tracing-core.", "tree": {"sha": "69ac700831c808b01a769a29f36ff2d796d0b91f", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/69ac700831c808b01a769a29f36ff2d796d0b91f"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/fa79db83f6c48c032bb149fc32999f64187c6f93", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/fa79db83f6c48c032bb149fc32999f64187c6f93", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/fa79db83f6c48c032bb149fc32999f64187c6f93", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/fa79db83f6c48c032bb149fc32999f64187c6f93/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "71569e420107ab034910a4687f382385975fa0b3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/71569e420107ab034910a4687f382385975fa0b3", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/71569e420107ab034910a4687f382385975fa0b3"}, {"sha": "77d4f94201df03df1e4f9a2ac133c994927e4cd2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/77d4f94201df03df1e4f9a2ac133c994927e4cd2", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/77d4f94201df03df1e4f9a2ac133c994927e4cd2"}], "stats": {"total": 8, "additions": 4, "deletions": 4}, "files": [{"sha": "8deab1deee0d68c9a631657a1cefbaf3ae2f08d7", "filename": "Cargo.lock", "status": "modified", "additions": 4, "deletions": 4, "changes": 8, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/fa79db83f6c48c032bb149fc32999f64187c6f93/Cargo.lock", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/fa79db83f6c48c032bb149fc32999f64187c6f93/Cargo.lock", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/Cargo.lock?ref=fa79db83f6c48c032bb149fc32999f64187c6f93", "patch": "@@ -4985,9 +4985,9 @@ dependencies = [\n \n [[package]]\n name = \"tracing-attributes\"\n-version = \"0.1.10\"\n+version = \"0.1.11\"\n source = \"registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index\"\n-checksum = \"1fe233f4227389ab7df5b32649239da7ebe0b281824b4e84b342d04d3fd8c25e\"\n+checksum = \"80e0ccfc3378da0cce270c946b676a376943f5cd16aeba64568e7939806f4ada\"\n dependencies = [\n  \"proc-macro2\",\n  \"quote\",\n@@ -4996,9 +4996,9 @@ dependencies = [\n \n [[package]]\n name = \"tracing-core\"\n-version = \"0.1.14\"\n+version = \"0.1.15\"\n source = \"registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index\"\n-checksum = \"db63662723c316b43ca36d833707cc93dff82a02ba3d7e354f342682cc8b3545\"\n+checksum = \"4f0e00789804e99b20f12bc7003ca416309d28a6f495d6af58d1e2c2842461b5\"\n dependencies = [\n  \"lazy_static\",\n ]"}]}
