If you've run `python\n+x.py build`, then you can add your custom rustc to a new toolchain like this:\n+\n+[toolchain-link]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs#working-with-custom-toolchains-and-local-builds\n+\n+```\n+rustup toolchain link <name> build/<host-triple>/stage2\n+```\n+\n+Where `<host-triple>` is the build triple for the host (the triple of your\n+computer, by default), and `<name>` is the name for your custom toolchain. (If you\n+added `--stage 1` to your build command, the compiler will be in the `stage1`\n+folder instead.) You'll only need to do this once - it will automatically point\n+to the latest build you've done.\n+\n+Once this is set up, you can use your custom toolchain just like any other. For\n+example, if you've named your toolchain `local`, running `cargo +local build` will\n+compile a project with your custom rustc, setting `rustup override set local` will\n+override the toolchain for your current directory, and `cargo +local doc` will use\n+your custom rustc and rustdoc to generate docs. (If you do this with a `--stage 1`\n+build, you'll need to build rustdoc specially, since it's not normally built in\n+stage 1. `python x.py build --stage 1 src/libstd src/tools/rustdoc` will build\n+rustdoc and libstd, which will allow rustdoc to be run with that toolchain.)\n \n ## Pull Requests\n "}]}
