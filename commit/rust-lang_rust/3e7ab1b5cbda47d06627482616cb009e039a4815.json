Why the underscore?\n-Well, if we remove it and compile:\n-\n-```bash\n-$ cargo build\n-   Compiling embed v0.1.0 (file:///home/steve/src/embed)\n-src/lib.rs:3:1: 16:2 warning: function is never used: `process`, #[warn(dead_code)] on by default\n-src/lib.rs:3 fn process() {\n-src/lib.rs:4     let handles: Vec<_> = (0..10).map(|_| {\n-src/lib.rs:5         thread::spawn(|| {\n-src/lib.rs:6             let mut x = 0;\n-src/lib.rs:7             for _ in (0..5_000_000) {\n-src/lib.rs:8                 x += 1\n-             ...\n-src/lib.rs:6:17: 6:22 warning: variable `x` is assigned to, but never used, #[warn(unused_variables)] on by default\n-src/lib.rs:6             let mut x = 0;\n-                             ^~~~~\n-```\n-\n-That first warning is because we are building a library. If we had a test\n-for this function, the warning would go away. But for now, it\u2019s never\n-called.\n-\n-The second is related to `x` versus `_x`. Because we never actually _do_\n-anything with `x`, we get a warning about it. In our case, that\u2019s perfectly\n-okay, as we\u2019re just trying to waste CPU cycles. Prefixing `x` with the\n-underscore removes the warning.\n-\n-Finally, we join on each thread.\n+loop five million times, and add one to `x` each time. Finally, we join on\n+each thread.\n \n Right now, however, this is a Rust library, and it doesn\u2019t expose anything\n that\u2019s callable from C.
