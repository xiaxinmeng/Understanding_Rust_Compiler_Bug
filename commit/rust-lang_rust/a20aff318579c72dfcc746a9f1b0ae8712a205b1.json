distribution channels for Rust: nightly, beta, and stable.\n+Unstable features are only available on nightly Rust. For more details on this\n+process, see [this post](http://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/10/30/Stability.html).\n+\n+To install nightly Rust, you can use `rustup.sh`:\n+\n+```bash\n+$ curl -s https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sudo sh -s -- --channel=nightly\n+```\n+\n+If you're concerned about the [potential insecurity](http://curlpipesh.tumblr.com/) of using `curl | sudo sh`,\n+please keep reading and see our disclaimer below. And feel free to use a two-step version of the installation and examine our installation script:\n+\n+```bash\n+$ curl -f -L https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh -O\n+$ sudo sh rustup.sh --channel=nightly\n+```\n+\n+If you're on Windows, please download either the [32-bit\n+installer](https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-nightly-i686-pc-windows-gnu.exe)\n+or the [64-bit\n+installer](https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.exe)\n+and run it.\n+\n+If you decide you don't want Rust anymore, we'll be a bit sad, but that's okay.\n+Not every programming language is great for everyone. Just run the uninstall\n+script:\n+\n+```bash\n+$ sudo /usr/local/lib/rustlib/uninstall.sh\n+```\n+\n+If you used the Windows installer, just re-run the `.exe` and it will give you\n+an uninstall option.\n+\n+You can re-run this script any time you want to update Rust. Which, at this\n+point, is often. Rust is still pre-1.0, and so people assume that you're using\n+a very recent Rust.\n+\n+This brings me to one other point: some people, and somewhat rightfully so, get\n+very upset when we tell you to `curl | sudo sh`. And they should be! Basically,\n+when you do this, you are trusting that the good people who maintain Rust\n+aren't going to hack your computer and do bad things. That's a good instinct!\n+If you're one of those people, please check out the documentation on [building\n+Rust from Source](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust#building-from-source), or\n+[the official binary downloads](http://www.rust-lang.org/install.html). And we\n+promise that this method will not be the way to install Rust forever: it's just\n+the easiest way to keep people updated while Rust is in its alpha state.\n+"}]}
