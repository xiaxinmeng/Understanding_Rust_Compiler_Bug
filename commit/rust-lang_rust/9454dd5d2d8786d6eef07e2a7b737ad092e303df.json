I am not a native speaker, but this sounds odd to me. Do you mean \"For a quick build of a usable compiler\" (but then it should say where the usable compiler is produced)? Or do you mean \"For a quick build testing if the compiler is usable\"? I can reword this, but I'd like to make sure I understand the intent of the message.\n\nWhat about\n```\n    For a quick build of a usable compiler, you can pass:\n\n        ./x.py build --stage 1 src/libtest\n\n    This will first build everything once (like --stage 0 without further\n    arguments would), and then use the compiler built in stage 0 to build\n    src/libtest and its dependencies.\n    Once this is done, build/$ARCH/stage1 contains a usable compiler.\n```\nHowever, I am not sure this is actually true. In particular, why even bother building the libstd in stage 1? AFAIK that ends up in `build/*/stage1-std`, not in `build/*/stage1` (which is filled from `build/*/stage0-*`).", "tree": {"sha": "0ebd8426f8d54bc0ebd95cdbbd66999d3c8e1206", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/0ebd8426f8d54bc0ebd95cdbbd66999d3c8e1206"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/9454dd5d2d8786d6eef07e2a7b737ad092e303df", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/9454dd5d2d8786d6eef07e2a7b737ad092e303df", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/9454dd5d2d8786d6eef07e2a7b737ad092e303df", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/9454dd5d2d8786d6eef07e2a7b737ad092e303df/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "148e9171481da43738d7d7a79c5e6f7bc2c2ccde", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/148e9171481da43738d7d7a79c5e6f7bc2c2ccde", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/148e9171481da43738d7d7a79c5e6f7bc2c2ccde"}, {"sha": "7359c791b50ebe0fa7ccf48faf5a272491c779e3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/7359c791b50ebe0fa7ccf48faf5a272491c779e3", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/7359c791b50ebe0fa7ccf48faf5a272491c779e3"}], "stats": {"total": 9, "additions": 7, "deletions": 2}, "files": [{"sha": "56cbb4cecf2a5b08f2a3a006ed9f144ce41a3020", "filename": "src/bootstrap/flags.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 7, "deletions": 2, "changes": 9, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/9454dd5d2d8786d6eef07e2a7b737ad092e303df/src%2Fbootstrap%2Fflags.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/9454dd5d2d8786d6eef07e2a7b737ad092e303df/src%2Fbootstrap%2Fflags.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Fbootstrap%2Fflags.rs?ref=9454dd5d2d8786d6eef07e2a7b737ad092e303df", "patch": "@@ -196,9 +196,14 @@ Arguments:\n         ./x.py build\n         ./x.py build --stage 1\n \n-    For a quick build with a usable compile, you can pass:\n+    For a quick build of a usable compiler, you can pass:\n \n-        ./x.py build --stage 1 src/libtest\");\n+        ./x.py build --stage 1 src/libtest\n+\n+    This will first build everything once (like --stage 0 without further\n+    arguments would), and then use the compiler built in stage 0 to build\n+    src/libtest and its dependencies.\n+    Once this is done, build/$ARCH/stage1 contains a usable compiler.\");\n             }\n             \"test\" => {\n                 subcommand_help.push_str(\"\\n"}]}
