Travis will automatically test all PRs which are opened\r\nagainst the rust repository, informing PR owners of the test results.\r\n\r\nI believe that this will be a very convenient piece of infrastructure as we'll\r\nbe able to reduce the load on bors quite a bit. In theory all PRs opened have\r\nhad the full test suite run against them, but unfortunately this is rarely the\r\ncase (I'm a prime suspect). Travis will be able to provide easy and relatively\r\nquick (~30min) feedback for PRs. By ensuring fewer failures on bors, we can\r\nhopefully feed more successful jobs to bors.\r\n\r\nOverall, I expect this to be very helpful for new contributors as well as\r\nregular contributors as it's another layer of tests being run which will\r\nhopefully catch things sooner. One of the most convenient parts about using\r\nTravis is that there's very little burden in terms of maintenance, and if things\r\ngo wrong we can easily turn travis completely off.\r\n\r\nNote that this is *not* the metric by which a PR will be merged with. Using\r\ntravis will purely be another source for running tests, we will continue to gate\r\nall PRs on bors.", "tree": {"sha": "2ccdee3668f1eadbe6fa687a89d79ff7ddaa34fe", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/2ccdee3668f1eadbe6fa687a89d79ff7ddaa34fe"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/51676b21d63ee427be862b1f8112def790cd57a4", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/51676b21d63ee427be862b1f8112def790cd57a4", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/51676b21d63ee427be862b1f8112def790cd57a4", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/51676b21d63ee427be862b1f8112def790cd57a4/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "f764d477ebb3cb6406b365e07d1bafb17f989a12", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/f764d477ebb3cb6406b365e07d1bafb17f989a12", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/f764d477ebb3cb6406b365e07d1bafb17f989a12"}, {"sha": "5bb204ffdbb4305b8f9ab4d2f2d26f805e4fe92c", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/5bb204ffdbb4305b8f9ab4d2f2d26f805e4fe92c", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/5bb204ffdbb4305b8f9ab4d2f2d26f805e4fe92c"}], "stats": {"total": 54, "additions": 54, "deletions": 0}, "files": [{"sha": "a443581b58e9f896c03946dc17276b900169de49", "filename": ".travis.yml", "status": "added", "additions": 53, "deletions": 0, "changes": 53, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/51676b21d63ee427be862b1f8112def790cd57a4/.travis.yml", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/51676b21d63ee427be862b1f8112def790cd57a4/.travis.yml", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/.travis.yml?ref=51676b21d63ee427be862b1f8112def790cd57a4", "patch": "@@ -0,0 +1,53 @@\n+# Use something that's not 'ruby' so we don't set up things like\n+# RVM/bundler/ruby and whatnot.
