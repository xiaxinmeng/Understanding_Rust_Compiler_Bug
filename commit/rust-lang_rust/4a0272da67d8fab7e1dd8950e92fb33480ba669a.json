The constructors are never used, and I don't foresee people using them. The people implementing the glob functionality don't seem to be reaching for this POSIX `glob` function, so it seems unlikely to be used heavily.\r\n* At the same time, the old name, `Some`, needlessly conflicted with the same re-exported name in the prelude, which impacted everybody who use glob imports with `libc`. Changing it to something else would simplify things greatly for those people.\r\n* `NotNull` seemed like the best option (others included `Just`, `Valid`, etc. which all had somewhat different connotations than what this type was going for (even `Some` doesn't quite seem like the opposite of `Null`)). Other options included removing the type completely and adding a special, `glob`-specific type. This latter approach doesn't seem future-proof.\r\n\r\nOverall, I feel like this is a mildly positive change.", "tree": {"sha": "b1591653e3811d4d84bc48d3d16ef9fd1272e178", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/b1591653e3811d4d84bc48d3d16ef9fd1272e178"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/4a0272da67d8fab7e1dd8950e92fb33480ba669a", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/4a0272da67d8fab7e1dd8950e92fb33480ba669a", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/4a0272da67d8fab7e1dd8950e92fb33480ba669a", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/4a0272da67d8fab7e1dd8950e92fb33480ba669a/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "a6758e344bc13de90ee0583a5764092cfbc36df8", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/a6758e344bc13de90ee0583a5764092cfbc36df8", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/a6758e344bc13de90ee0583a5764092cfbc36df8"}, {"sha": "f6a679f87ddfed6c759b8a9d5cfc0393a7b6d00b", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/f6a679f87ddfed6c759b8a9d5cfc0393a7b6d00b", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/f6a679f87ddfed6c759b8a9d5cfc0393a7b6d00b"}], "stats": {"total": 2, "additions": 1, "deletions": 1}, "files": [{"sha": "9c699a880075dcb43c337b12f32ab9c824b96414", "filename": "src/liblibc/lib.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 1, "deletions": 1, "changes": 2, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/4a0272da67d8fab7e1dd8950e92fb33480ba669a/src%2Fliblibc%2Flib.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/4a0272da67d8fab7e1dd8950e92fb33480ba669a/src%2Fliblibc%2Flib.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Fliblibc%2Flib.rs?ref=4a0272da67d8fab7e1dd8950e92fb33480ba669a", "patch": "@@ -304,7 +304,7 @@ extern {}\n // If/when libprim happens, this can be removed in favor of that\n pub enum Nullable<T> {\n     Null,\n-    Some(T)\n+    NotNull(T)\n }\n \n pub mod types {"}]}
