To do\nthis rustbuild doesn't know the artifact name of the standard library so it just\nprobes everything in the target directory, looking to see if anything changed.\n\nThe problem here happened where:\n\n* First, rustbuild would compile everything (a normal build)\n* Next, rustbuild would run all tests\n* During testing, the libbuild_helper library was introduced into the target\n  directory, making it look like a change happened because a file is newer\n  than the newest was before\n* Detecting a change, the next compilation would then cause rustbuild to clean\n  out old artifacts and recompile everything again.\n\nThis commit fixes this problem by correcting rustbuild to just not test the\nbuild_helper crate at all. This crate doesn't have any unit tests, nor is it\nintended to. That way the target directories should stay the same throughout\ntesting after a previous build.", "tree": {"sha": "e3c3ec43a33c8325550ce735ea37e7d7bdab83e6", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/e3c3ec43a33c8325550ce735ea37e7d7bdab83e6"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/7a526ca05a6a1223429ee4f3de6260f0e5a2b24a", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/7a526ca05a6a1223429ee4f3de6260f0e5a2b24a", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/7a526ca05a6a1223429ee4f3de6260f0e5a2b24a", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/7a526ca05a6a1223429ee4f3de6260f0e5a2b24a/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "d274e554ad8327d4042ed71c1e3e5fa23d36f414", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/d274e554ad8327d4042ed71c1e3e5fa23d36f414", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/d274e554ad8327d4042ed71c1e3e5fa23d36f414"}, {"sha": "36a926a2164f8e7eaed7bbfd261f11976243cb76", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/36a926a2164f8e7eaed7bbfd261f11976243cb76", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/36a926a2164f8e7eaed7bbfd261f11976243cb76"}], "stats": {"total": 14, "additions": 10, "deletions": 4}, "files": [{"sha": "4aca843558fd01275f7297c9f351b6bead67a895", "filename": "src/bootstrap/check.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 10, "deletions": 4, "changes": 14, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/7a526ca05a6a1223429ee4f3de6260f0e5a2b24a/src%2Fbootstrap%2Fcheck.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/7a526ca05a6a1223429ee4f3de6260f0e5a2b24a/src%2Fbootstrap%2Fcheck.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Fbootstrap%2Fcheck.rs?ref=7a526ca05a6a1223429ee4f3de6260f0e5a2b24a", "patch": "@@ -373,10 +373,16 @@ pub fn krate(build: &Build,\n             let mut visited = HashSet::new();\n             let mut next = vec![root];\n             while let Some(name) = next.pop() {\n-                // Right now jemalloc is our only target-specific crate in the sense\n-                // that it's not present on all platforms.
