Rust's support levels are organized\n-into three tiers, each with a different set of guarantees.\n-\n-Platforms are identified by their \"target triple\" which is the string to inform\n-the compiler what kind of output should be produced. The columns below indicate\n-whether the corresponding component works on the specified platform.\n-\n-### Tier 1\n-\n-Tier 1 platforms can be thought of as \"guaranteed to build and work\".\n-Specifically they will each satisfy the following requirements:\n-\n-* Automated testing is set up to run tests for the platform.\n-* Landing changes to the `rust-lang/rust` repository's master branch is gated on\n-  tests passing.\n-* Official release artifacts are provided for the platform.\n-* Documentation for how to use and how to build the platform is available.\n-\n-|  Target                       | std |rustc|cargo| notes                      |\n-|-------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------------------|\n-| `i686-apple-darwin`           |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 32-bit OSX (10.7+, Lion+)  |\n-| `i686-pc-windows-gnu`         |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 32-bit MinGW (Windows 7+)  |\n-| `i686-pc-windows-msvc`        |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 32-bit MSVC (Windows 7+)   |\n-| `i686-unknown-linux-gnu`      |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 32-bit Linux (2.6.18+)     |\n-| `x86_64-apple-darwin`         |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 64-bit OSX (10.7+, Lion+)  |\n-| `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`       |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 64-bit MinGW (Windows 7+)  |\n-| `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`      |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 64-bit MSVC (Windows 7+)   |\n-| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`    |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 64-bit Linux (2.6.18+)     |\n-\n-### Tier 2\n-\n-Tier 2 platforms can be thought of as \"guaranteed to build\".

Specifically,\n-these platforms are required to have each of the following:\n-\n-* Automated building is set up, but may not be running tests.\n-* Landing changes to the `rust-lang/rust` repository's master branch is gated on\n-  platforms **building**. Note that this means for some platforms only the\n-  standard library is compiled, but for others the full bootstrap is run.\n-* Official release artifacts are provided for the platform.\n-\n-|  Target                       | std |rustc|cargo| notes                      |\n-|-------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------------------|\n-| `aarch64-apple-ios`           |  \u2713  |     |     | ARM64 iOS                  |\n-| `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`   |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | ARM64 Linux (2.6.18+)      |\n-| `arm-linux-androideabi`       |  \u2713  |     |     | ARM Android                |\n-| `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi`   |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | ARM Linux (2.6.18+)        |\n-| `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | ARM Linux (2.6.18+)        |\n-| `armv7-apple-ios`             |  \u2713  |     |     | ARM iOS                    |\n-|`armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`|  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | ARMv7 Linux (2.6.18+)      |\n-| `armv7s-apple-ios`            |  \u2713  |     |     | ARM iOS                    |\n-| `i386-apple-ios`              |  \u2713  |     |     | 32-bit x86 iOS             |\n-| `i586-pc-windows-msvc`        |  \u2713  |     |     | 32-bit Windows w/o SSE     |\n-| `mips-unknown-linux-gnu`      |  \u2713  |     |     | MIPS Linux (2.6.18+)       |\n-| `mips-unknown-linux-musl`     |  \u2713  |     |     | MIPS Linux with MUSL       |\n-| `mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu`    |  \u2713  |     |     | MIPS (LE) Linux (2.6.18+)  |\n-| `mipsel-unknown-linux-musl`   |  \u2713  |     |     | MIPS (LE) Linux with MUSL  |\n-| `powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu`   |  \u2713  |     |     | PowerPC Linux (2.6.18+)    |\n-| `powerpc64-unknown-linux-gnu` |  \u2713  |     |     | PPC64 Linux (2.6.18+)      |\n-|`powerpc64le-unknown-linux-gnu`|  \u2713  |     |     | PPC64LE Linux (2.6.18+)    |\n-| `x86_64-apple-ios`            |  \u2713  |     |     | 64-bit x86 iOS             |\n-| `x86_64-rumprun-netbsd`       |  \u2713  |     |     | 64-bit NetBSD Rump Kernel  |\n-| `x86_64-unknown-freebsd`      |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 64-bit FreeBSD             |\n-| `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`   |  \u2713  |     |     | 64-bit Linux with MUSL     |\n-| `x86_64-unknown-netbsd`       |  \u2713  |  \u2713  |  \u2713  | 64-bit NetBSD              |\n-\n-### Tier 3\n-\n-Tier 3 platforms are those which Rust has support for, but landing changes is\n-not gated on the platform either building or passing tests.
