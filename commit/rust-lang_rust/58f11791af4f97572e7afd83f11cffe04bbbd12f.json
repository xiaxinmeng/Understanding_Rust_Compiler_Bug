For some reason, it has recently started failing with a permission denied trying to overwrite `/tmp/build.log`.  This file exists from the `build-toolchains.sh` step, which is owned by the rustbuild user. I think there is some behavior where a sticky `/tmp` directory doesn't allow overwriting files owned by other users even when running as root.  I do not know why this has suddenly started, and I can't reproduce locally with my own docker setup. However, this fix seems to work on CI.", "tree": {"sha": "c49f2fa96fd0796ab03fbe91e3f22dc19385b77f", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/c49f2fa96fd0796ab03fbe91e3f22dc19385b77f"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/58f11791af4f97572e7afd83f11cffe04bbbd12f", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/58f11791af4f97572e7afd83f11cffe04bbbd12f", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/58f11791af4f97572e7afd83f11cffe04bbbd12f", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/58f11791af4f97572e7afd83f11cffe04bbbd12f/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "461e8078010433ff7de2db2aaae8a3cfb0847215", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/461e8078010433ff7de2db2aaae8a3cfb0847215", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/461e8078010433ff7de2db2aaae8a3cfb0847215"}, {"sha": "8322cdb1da257652bf663ae335b190dc129e479f", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/8322cdb1da257652bf663ae335b190dc129e479f", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/8322cdb1da257652bf663ae335b190dc129e479f"}], "stats": {"total": 6, "additions": 3, "deletions": 3}, "files": [{"sha": "f124dbdaa6d3bdcb6a081eeeac39efff548c024c", "filename": "src/ci/docker/scripts/cmake.sh", "status": "modified", "additions": 3, "deletions": 3, "changes": 6, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/58f11791af4f97572e7afd83f11cffe04bbbd12f/src%2Fci%2Fdocker%2Fscripts%2Fcmake.sh", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/58f11791af4f97572e7afd83f11cffe04bbbd12f/src%2Fci%2Fdocker%2Fscripts%2Fcmake.sh", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Fci%2Fdocker%2Fscripts%2Fcmake.sh?ref=58f11791af4f97572e7afd83f11cffe04bbbd12f", "patch": "@@ -5,16 +5,16 @@ hide_output() {\n   set +x\n   on_err=\"\n echo ERROR: An error was encountered with the build.\n-cat /tmp/build.log\n+cat /tmp/cmake_build.log\n exit 1\n \"\n   trap \"$on_err\" ERR\n   bash -c \"while true; do sleep 30; echo \\$(date) - building ...; done\" &\n   PING_LOOP_PID=$!\n-  \"$@\" &> /tmp/build.log\n+  \"$@\" &> /tmp/cmake_build.log\n   trap - ERR\n   kill $PING_LOOP_PID\n-  rm /tmp/build.log\n+  rm /tmp/cmake_build.log\n   set -x\n }\n "}]}
