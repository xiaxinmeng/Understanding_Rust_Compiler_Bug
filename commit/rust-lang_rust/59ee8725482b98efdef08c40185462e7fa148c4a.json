One reason for this is\nthat the other teams discuss their nominated issues in meetings, while\nrustdoc is an async-only team.\n\nHowever, it might be helpful to start using the `I-nominated` label for\nrustdoc. The team currently uses a `cc @rust-lang/rustdoc` ping as the\nequivalent, but it's easier to track issues when they use `I-nominated`.\nAlso we'd be more consistent with the other teams' procedures.\n\nSince rustdoc doesn't have meetings, I propose we instead use the\ntriagebot notify Zulip functionality to create a topic in `#rustdoc` on\nZulip and ping the team. So it would look a bit like the procedure for\nWG-prioritization when an issue acquires the `I-prioritize` label.", "tree": {"sha": "b0c4d249f3002e1bb4019b6639ef3a7ad5697f48", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/b0c4d249f3002e1bb4019b6639ef3a7ad5697f48"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/59ee8725482b98efdef08c40185462e7fa148c4a", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/59ee8725482b98efdef08c40185462e7fa148c4a", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/59ee8725482b98efdef08c40185462e7fa148c4a", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/59ee8725482b98efdef08c40185462e7fa148c4a/comments", "author": {"login": "camelid", "id": 37223377, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjIzMzc3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37223377?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid", "html_url": "https://github.com/camelid", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "camelid", "id": 37223377, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjIzMzc3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37223377?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid", "html_url": "https://github.com/camelid", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/camelid/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "94736c434ee154b30e2ec22ec112b79e3f6c5884", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/94736c434ee154b30e2ec22ec112b79e3f6c5884", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/94736c434ee154b30e2ec22ec112b79e3f6c5884"}], "stats": {"total": 9, "additions": 9, "deletions": 0}, "files": [{"sha": "8b6157cd4aae23b82d2349452b1d584851c6b680", "filename": "triagebot.toml", "status": "modified", "additions": 9, "deletions": 0, "changes": 9, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/59ee8725482b98efdef08c40185462e7fa148c4a/triagebot.toml", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/59ee8725482b98efdef08c40185462e7fa148c4a/triagebot.toml", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/triagebot.toml?ref=59ee8725482b98efdef08c40185462e7fa148c4a", "patch": "@@ -102,6 +102,15 @@ message_on_add = \"\"\"\\\n \"\"\"\n message_on_remove = \"Issue #{number}'s prioritization request has been removed.\"\n \n+[notify-zulip.\"T-rustdoc\"]\n+required_labels = [\"I-nominated\"]\n+zulip_stream = 266220 # #rustdoc\n+topic = \"nominated: #{number}\"\n+message_on_add = \"\"\"\\\n+@*T-rustdoc* issue #{number} \"{title}\" has been nominated for `T-rustdoc` discussion.\n+\"\"\"\n+message_on_remove = \"Issue #{number}'s nomination request has been removed.\"\n+\n [github-releases]\n format = \"rustc\"\n project-name = \"Rust\""}]}
