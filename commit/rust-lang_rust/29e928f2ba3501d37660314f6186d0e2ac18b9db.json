On the one hand, this is clearly undesirable; on the other hand, this problem is full of trade-offs and we'd like to point a few important qualifications:\n \n-* Scanning a `str` for ASCII-range codepoints can still be done safely octet-at-a-time, with each indexing operation pulling out a `u8` costing only O(1) and producing a value that can be cast and compared to an ASCII-range `char`.

So if you're (say) line-breaking on `'\\n'`, octet-based treatment still works. UTF8 was well-designed this way.\n * Most \"character oriented\" operations on text only work under very restricted language assumptions sets such as \"ASCII-range codepoints only\". Outside ASCII-range, you tend to have to use a complex (non-constant-time) algorithm for determining linguistic-unit (glyph, word, paragraph) boundaries anyways. We recommend using an \"honest\" linguistically-aware, Unicode-approved algorithm.\n * The `char` type is UCS4. If you honestly need to do a codepoint-at-a-time algorithm, it's trivial to write a `type wstr = [char]`, and unpack a `str` into it in a single pass, then work with the `wstr`. In other words: the fact that the language is not \"decoding to UCS4 by default\" shouldn't stop you from decoding (or re-encoding any other way) if you need to work with that encoding.\n "}]}
