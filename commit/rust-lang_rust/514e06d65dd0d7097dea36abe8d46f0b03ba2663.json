You don\u2019t need some sort of\n+special annotation here, it\u2019s the default thing that Rust does.\n+\n+# The details\n+\n+The reason that we cannot use a binding after we\u2019ve moved it is subtle, but\n+important. When we write code like this:\n+\n+```rust\n+let v = vec![1, 2, 3];\n+\n+let v2 = v;\n+```\n+\n+The first line creates some data for the vector on the stack, `v`. The vector\u2019s\n+data, however, is stored on the heap, and so it contains a pointer to that\n+data. When we move `v` to `v2`, it creates a copy of that data, for `v2`. Which\n+would mean two pointers to the contents of the vector on the heap. That would\n+be a problem: it would violate Rust\u2019s safety guarantees by introducing a data\n+race. Therefore, Rust forbids using `v` after we\u2019ve done the move.\n+\n+It\u2019s also important to note that optimizations may remove the actual copy of\n+the bytes, depending on circumstances. So it may not be as inefficient as it\n+initially seems.\n+\n+# `Copy` types\n+\n+We\u2019ve established that when ownership is transferred to another binding, you\n+cannot use the original binding. However, there\u2019s a [trait][traits] that changes this\n+behavior, and it\u2019s called `Copy`. We haven\u2019t discussed traits yet, but for now,\n+you can think of them as an annotation to a particular type that adds extra\n+behavior. For example:\n+\n+```rust\n+let v = 1;\n+\n+let v2 = v;\n+\n+println!(\"v is: {}\", v);\n+```\n+\n+In this case, `v` is an `i32`, which implements the `Copy` trait. This means\n+that, just like a move, when we assign `v` to `v2`, a copy of the data is made.\n+But, unlike a move, we can still use `v` afterward. This is because an `i32`\n+has no pointers to data somewhere else, copying it is a full copy.\n+\n+We will discuss how to make your own types `Copy` in the [traits][traits]\n+section.\n+\n+[traits]: traits.html"}, {"sha": "0e13ea612645cf5a101154d671c70e052bd24d81", "filename": "src/doc/trpl/references-and-borrowing.md", "status": "modified", "additions": 1, "deletions": 1, "changes": 2, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/514e06d65dd0d7097dea36abe8d46f0b03ba2663/src%2Fdoc%2Ftrpl%2Freferences-and-borrowing.md", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/514e06d65dd0d7097dea36abe8d46f0b03ba2663/src%2Fdoc%2Ftrpl%2Freferences-and-borrowing.md", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Fdoc%2Ftrpl%2Freferences-and-borrowing.md?ref=514e06d65dd0d7097dea36abe8d46f0b03ba2663", "patch": "@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@\n % References and Borrowing\n \n-Coming Soon!\n+Coming Soon!
