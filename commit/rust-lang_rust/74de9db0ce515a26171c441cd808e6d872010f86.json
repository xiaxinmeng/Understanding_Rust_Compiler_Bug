It is recommend\n+to read and understand the [rustc-dev-guide] before making a contribution. This guide\n+talks about the different bots in the Rust ecosystem, the Rust development tools,\n+bootstrapping, the compiler architecture, source code representation, and more.\n+\n+## [Getting help](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/getting-started.html#asking-questions)\n+\n+There are many ways you can get help when you're stuck. Rust has many platforms for this:\n+[internals], [rust-zulip], and [rust-discord]. It is recommended to ask for help on\n+the [rust-zulip], but any of these platforms are a great way to seek help and even\n+find a mentor!
