Rust sets the drop flag by overwriting\n-the entire value with a particular bit pattern. This is pretty obviously Not\n-The Fastest and causes a bunch of trouble with optimizing code. It's legacy from\n-a time when you could do much more complex conditional initialization.\n-\n-As such work is currently under way to move the flags out onto the stack frame\n-where they more reasonably belong. Unfortunately, this work will take some time\n-as it requires fairly substantial changes to the compiler.\n-\n-Regardless, Rust programs don't need to worry about uninitialized values on\n-the stack for correctness. Although they might care for performance. Thankfully,\n-Rust makes it easy to take control here! Uninitialized values are there, and\n-you can work with them in Safe Rust, but you're never in danger.\n+The drop flags are tracked on the stack and no longer stashed in types that\n+implement drop."}]}
