However, there are\n+some types which are useful to express, but do not have a defined size. These are\n+called \u2018unsized\u2019 or \u2018dynamically sized\u2019 types. One example is `[T]`. This type\n+represents a certain number of `T` in sequence. But we don\u2019t know how many\n+there are, so the size is not known.\n+\n+Rust understands a few of these types, but they have some restrictions. There\n+are three:\n+\n+1. We can only manipulate an instance of an unsized type via a pointer. An\n+   `&[T]` works just fine, but a `[T]` does not.\n+2. Variables and arguments cannot have dynamically sized types.\n+3. Only the last field in a `struct` may have a dynamically sized type; the\n+   other fields must not. Enum variants must not have dynamically sized types as\n+   data.\n+\n+So why bother? Well, because `[T]` can only be used behind a pointer, if we\n+didn\u2019t have language support for unsized types, it would be impossible to write\n+this:\n+\n+```rust,ignore\n+impl Foo for str {\n+```\n+\n+or\n+\n+```rust,ignore\n+impl<T> Foo for [T] {\n+```\n+\n+Instead, you would have to write:\n+\n+```rust,ignore\n+impl Foo for &str {\n+```\n+\n+Meaning, this implementation would only work for [references][ref], and not\n+other types of pointers.
