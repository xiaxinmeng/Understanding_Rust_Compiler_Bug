Eager expansion related utils\n+//!\n+//! Here is a dump of a discussion from Vadim Petrochenkov about Eager Expansion and\n+//! Its name resolution :\n+//!\n+//! > Eagerly expanded macros (and also macros eagerly expanded by eagerly expanded macros,\n+//! > which actually happens in practice too!) are resolved at the location of the \"root\" macro\n+//! > that performs the eager expansion on its arguments.\n+//! > If some name cannot be resolved at the eager expansion time it's considered unresolved,\n+//! > even if becomes available later (e.g. from a glob import or other macro).\n+//!\n+//! > Eagerly expanded macros don't add anything to the module structure of the crate and\n+//! > don't build any speculative module structures, i.e. they are expanded in a \"flat\"\n+//! > way even if tokens in them look like modules.\n+//!\n+//! > In other words, it kinda works for simple cases for which it was originally intended,\n+//! > and we need to live with it because it's available on stable and widely relied upon.\n+//!\n+//!\n+//!
