This is a hypothetical\nexample--there are no actual philosophers eating spaghetti--so there is\nno good reason to make this assumption. Since women make up about half\nof the human population, all things being equal, women should represent\nabout half of the philosophers. However, because this mistake has stood\nsince 1985, I have changed *all* of the pronouns to be female, to make\nup for lost time.
