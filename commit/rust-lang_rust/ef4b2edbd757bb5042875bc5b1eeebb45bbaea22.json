For here\n+// stands the bastion of the Turbofish: an impenetrable fortress holding\n+// unshaking against those who would dare suggest the supererogation of the\n+// Turbofish.\n+//\n+// Once I was young and foolish and had the impudence to imagine that I could\n+// shake free from the coils by which that creature had us tightly bound. I\n+// dared to suggest that there was a better way: a brighter future, in which\n+// Rustaceans both new and old could be rid of that vile beast. But alas! In\n+// my foolhardiness my ignorance was unveiled and my dreams were dashed\n+// unforgivingly against the rock of syntactic ambiguity.\n+//\n+// This humble program, small and insignificant though it might seem,\n+// demonstrates that to which we had previously cast a blind eye: an ambiguity\n+// in permitting generic arguments to be provided without the consent of the\n+// Great Turbofish. Should you be so na\u00efve as to try to revolt against its\n+// mighty clutches, here shall its wrath be indomitably displayed. This\n+// program must pass for all eternity, fundamentally at odds with an impetuous\n+// rebellion against the Turbofish.\n+//\n+// My heart aches in sorrow, for I know I am defeated. Let this be a warning\n+// to all those who come after. Here stands the bastion of the Turbofish.\n+\n+fn main() {\n+    let (oh, woe, is, me) = (\"the\", \"Turbofish\", \"remains\", \"undefeated\");\n+    let _: (bool, bool) = (oh<woe, is>(me));\n+}"}]}
