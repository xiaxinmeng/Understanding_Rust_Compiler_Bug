Before pushing to your Github repo and issuing the pull request, please do two things:\n+\n+1. [Rebase](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) your local changes against the `incoming` branch. Resolve any conflicts that arise.\n+2. Run the full Rust test suite with the `make check` command. You're not off the hook even if you just stick to documentation; code examples in the docs are tested as well!\n+\n+Pull requests will be treated as \"review requests\", and we will give feedback we expect to see corrected on [style](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Note-style-guide) and substance before pulling. Changes contributed via pull request should focus on a single issue at a time, like any other. We will not look kindly on pull-requests that try to \"sneak\" unrelated changes in.\n+\n+Normally, all pull requests must include regression tests (see [[Note-testsuite]]) that test your change. Occasionally, a change will be very difficult to test for. In those cases, please include a note in your commit message explaining why.\n+\n+For more details, please refer to [[Note-development-policy]].\n\\ No newline at end of file"}, {"sha": "8cc2c8cc80a5545fbd0ef4bb0bf5ef5db8db3877", "filename": "src/test/run-pass/recursion.rs", "status": "added", "additions": 34, "deletions": 0, "changes": 34, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/c880d0ab7688af2cf5ed547019c22e10d81f7cb4/src%2Ftest%2Frun-pass%2Frecursion.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/c880d0ab7688af2cf5ed547019c22e10d81f7cb4/src%2Ftest%2Frun-pass%2Frecursion.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Ftest%2Frun-pass%2Frecursion.rs?ref=c880d0ab7688af2cf5ed547019c22e10d81f7cb4", "patch": "@@ -0,0 +1,34 @@\n+// Copyright 2012 The Rust Project Developers.
