This new crate is compatible with\n> `no_std` and provides `Mutex` and `RwLock` type-safe wrapper types from a\n> raw mutex type which implements the `RawMutex` or `RawRwLock` trait. The API\n> provided by the wrapper types can be extended by implementing more traits on the\n> raw mutex type which provide more functionality (e.g. `RawMutexTimed`). See the\n> crate documentation for more details.\n> \n> There are also several major changes:\n> \n> - The minimum required Rust version is bumped to 1.26.\n> - All methods on `MutexGuard` (and other guard types) are no longer inherent\n>   methods and must be called as `MutexGuard::method(self)`. This avoids\n>   conflicts with methods from the inner type.\n> - `MutexGuard` (and other guard types) add the `unlocked` method which\n>   temporarily unlocks a mutex, runs the given closure, and then re-locks the\n>    mutex.\n> - `MutexGuard` (and other guard types) add the `bump` method which gives a\n>   chance for other threads to acquire the mutex by temporarily unlocking it and\n>   re-locking it. However this is optimized for the common case where there are\n>   no threads waiting on the lock, in which case no unlocking is performed.\n> - `MutexGuard` (and other guard types) add the `map` method which returns a\n></table> ...
