Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n+   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n+   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n+   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n+\n+7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n+   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n+   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n+   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n+   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n+   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n+   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n+   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n+   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n+   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n+   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n+\n+9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n+   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n+   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n+   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n+   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n+   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n+   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n+   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n+   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n+   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n+\n+END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n+\n+   To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n+   boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n+   replaced with your own identifying information.
