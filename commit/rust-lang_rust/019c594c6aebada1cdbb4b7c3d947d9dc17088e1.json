This makes backports take a much longer time and causes a lot of problems for the syntex dependencies. Even if it was, it'd take a few release cycles until syntex would be able to use it. Since it's not stable and that this feature is just syntax sugar, it would be most helpful if we could remove it.\n\ncc #34311", "tree": {"sha": "0c722fd734c8b964c4f230f93b413535b987ca8d", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/0c722fd734c8b964c4f230f93b413535b987ca8d"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/019c594c6aebada1cdbb4b7c3d947d9dc17088e1", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/019c594c6aebada1cdbb4b7c3d947d9dc17088e1", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/019c594c6aebada1cdbb4b7c3d947d9dc17088e1", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/019c594c6aebada1cdbb4b7c3d947d9dc17088e1/comments", "author": {"login": "Manishearth", "id": 1617736, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc3MzY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1617736?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth", "html_url": "https://github.com/Manishearth", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Manishearth/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "web-flow", "id": 19864447, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODY0NDQ3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow", "html_url": "https://github.com/web-flow", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "5bac0c39857c786bdda68c3b48082668835da933", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/5bac0c39857c786bdda68c3b48082668835da933", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/5bac0c39857c786bdda68c3b48082668835da933"}, {"sha": "ba5cab1fe0a1cb6f3de5a338a8009b5b649a80c3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/ba5cab1fe0a1cb6f3de5a338a8009b5b649a80c3", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/ba5cab1fe0a1cb6f3de5a338a8009b5b649a80c3"}], "stats": {"total": 1718, "additions": 859, "deletions": 859}, "files": [{"sha": "0c90e102f3425c10c53b4dbb3bc281cd08001bb6", "filename": "src/libsyntax/print/pprust.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 859, "deletions": 859, "changes": 1718, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/019c594c6aebada1cdbb4b7c3d947d9dc17088e1/src%2Flibsyntax%2Fprint%2Fpprust.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/019c594c6aebada1cdbb4b7c3d947d9dc17088e1/src%2Flibsyntax%2Fprint%2Fpprust.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Flibsyntax%2Fprint%2Fpprust.rs?ref=019c594c6aebada1cdbb4b7c3d947d9dc17088e1"}]}
