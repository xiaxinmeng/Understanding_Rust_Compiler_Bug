The good news, however, is\n+that no matter your host OS/platform, it is easy to run code for *any* target\n+using `--target`!\n+\n+The following targets are tested on CI and thus should always work (to the\n+degree documented below):\n+\n+- The best-supported target is `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`. Miri releases are\n+  blocked on things working with this target. Most other Linux targets should\n+  also work well; we do run the test suite on `i686-unknown-linux-gnu` as a\n+  32bit target and `mips64-unknown-linux-gnuabi64` as a big-endian target.\n+- `x86_64-apple-darwin` should work basically as well as Linux. We also test\n+  `aarch64-apple-darwin`. However, we might ship Miri with a nightly even when\n+  some features on these targets regress.\n+- `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` works, but supports fewer features than the Linux and\n+  Apple targets. For example, file system access and concurrency are not\n+  supported on Windows. We also test `i686-pc-windows-msvc`, with the same\n+  reduced feature set. We might ship Miri with a nightly even when some features\n+  on these targets regress.\n+\n ### Common Problems\n \n When using the above instructions, you may encounter a number of confusing compiler"}]}
