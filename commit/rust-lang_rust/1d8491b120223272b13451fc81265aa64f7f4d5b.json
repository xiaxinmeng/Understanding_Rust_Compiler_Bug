Note that `fn_args_layout` has only been soft deprecated: `fn_args_layout` will continue to work without issue, but rustfmt will display a warning to encourage users to switch to the new name\n+\n+### Added\n+\n+- New configuration option (`skip_macro_invocations`)[https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt/?version=master&search=#skip_macro_invocations] [#5347](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/pull/5347) that can be used to globally define a single enumerated list of macro calls that rustfmt should skip formatting. rustfmt [currently also supports this via a custom tool attribute](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt#tips), however, these cannot be used in all contexts because [custom inner attributes are unstable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54726)\n+\n+### Misc\n+\n+- rustfmt now internally supports the ability to have both stable and unstable variants of a configuration option [#5378](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/5378). This ability will allow the rustfmt team to make certain configuration options available on stable toolchains more quickly because we no longer have to wait for _every_ variant to be stable-ready before stabilizing _any_ variant. \n+\n+### Install/Download Options\n+- **rustup (nightly)** - nightly-2023-01-24\n+- **GitHub Release Binaries** - [Release v1.5.2](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/releases/tag/v1.5.2)\n+- **Build from source** - [Tag v1.5.2](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/tree/v1.5.2), see instructions for how to [install rustfmt from source][install-from-source]\n+\n ## [1.5.1] 2022-06-24\n \n **N.B** A bug was introduced in v1.5.0/nightly-2022-06-15 which modified formatting.
