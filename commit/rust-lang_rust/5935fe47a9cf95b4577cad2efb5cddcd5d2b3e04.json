I believe there is a typo in the comment and ```return``` should be ```returns```. This PR fixes this issue.\n\nI also feel that the entire doc comment is a bit of a run-on and could be changed to something along the lines of ```Removes an element from anywhere in the vector and returns it. The vector is mutated and the removed element is replaced by the last element of the vector. ```\n\nThoughts?", "tree": {"sha": "a622f4946f2008d4ff9c1666d075f102b1ab2c19", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/a622f4946f2008d4ff9c1666d075f102b1ab2c19"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/5935fe47a9cf95b4577cad2efb5cddcd5d2b3e04", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/5935fe47a9cf95b4577cad2efb5cddcd5d2b3e04", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/5935fe47a9cf95b4577cad2efb5cddcd5d2b3e04", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/5935fe47a9cf95b4577cad2efb5cddcd5d2b3e04/comments", "author": {"login": "frewsxcv", "id": 416575, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjU3NQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/416575?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv", "html_url": "https://github.com/frewsxcv", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/frewsxcv/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "web-flow", "id": 19864447, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODY0NDQ3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow", "html_url": "https://github.com/web-flow", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "56b68305279059e0ff25f87a46e6fa5013a26ae3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/56b68305279059e0ff25f87a46e6fa5013a26ae3", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/56b68305279059e0ff25f87a46e6fa5013a26ae3"}, {"sha": "5787808d07b27d12a397cd20bd630a2ed1f35ca2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/5787808d07b27d12a397cd20bd630a2ed1f35ca2", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/5787808d07b27d12a397cd20bd630a2ed1f35ca2"}], "stats": {"total": 5, "additions": 3, "deletions": 2}, "files": [{"sha": "be613e06b02e87e5c845660aaff657f55496896c", "filename": "src/libcollections/vec.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 3, "deletions": 2, "changes": 5, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5935fe47a9cf95b4577cad2efb5cddcd5d2b3e04/src%2Flibcollections%2Fvec.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/5935fe47a9cf95b4577cad2efb5cddcd5d2b3e04/src%2Flibcollections%2Fvec.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Flibcollections%2Fvec.rs?ref=5935fe47a9cf95b4577cad2efb5cddcd5d2b3e04", "patch": "@@ -678,8 +678,9 @@ impl<T> Vec<T> {\n         self.len = len;\n     }\n \n-    /// Removes an element from anywhere in the vector and return it, replacing\n-    /// it with the last element.\n+    /// Removes an element from the vector and returns it.\n+    ///\n+    /// The removed element is replaced by the last element of the vector.\n     ///\n     /// This does not preserve ordering, but is O(1).\n     ///"}]}
