Numerous crates are now running on stable\n+      Rust. Starting with this release, it is not possible to use\n+      unstable features on a stable build.\n+    * Arithmetic on basic integer types now\n+      [checks for overflow in debug builds][overflow].\n+\n+* Language\n+\n+    * [`Send` no longer implies `'static`][send-rfc], which made\n+      possible the [`thread::scoped` API][scoped]. Scoped threads can\n+      borrow data from their parent's stack frame -- safely!\n+    * [UFCS now supports trait-less associated paths][moar-ufcs] like\n+      `MyType::default()`.\n+    * Primitive types [now have inherent methods][prim-inherent],\n+      obviating the need for extension traits like `SliceExt`.\n+    * Methods with `Self: Sized` in their `where` clause are\n+      [considered object-safe][self-sized], allowing many extension\n+      traits like `IteratorExt` to be merged into the traits they\n+      extended.\n+    * You can now [refer to associated types][assoc-where] whose\n+      corresponding trait bounds appear only in a `where` clause.\n+    * The final bits of [OIBIT landed][oibit-final], meaning that\n+      traits like `Send` and `Sync` are now library-defined.\n+    * A [Reflect trait][reflect] was introduced, which means that\n+      downcasting via the `Any` trait is effectively limited to\n+      concrete types. This helps retain the potentially-important\n+      \"parametricity\" property: generic code cannot behave differently\n+      for different type arguments.\n+    * The `unsafe_destructor` feature is now deprecated in favor of\n+      the [new `dropck`][dropck]. This change is a major reduction in\n+      unsafe code.\n+    * Trait coherence was [revised again][fundamental], this time with\n+      an eye toward API evolution over time.\n+\n+* Libraries\n+\n+    * The new path and IO modules are complete and `#[stable]`. This\n+      was the major library focus for this cycle.\n+    * The path API was [revised][path-normalize] to normalize `.`,\n+      adjusting the tradeoffs in favor of the most common usage.\n+    * A large number of remaining APIs in `std` were also stabilized\n+      during this cycle; about 75% of the non-deprecated API surface\n+      is now stable.\n+    * The new [string pattern API][string-pattern] landed, which makes\n+      the string slice API much more internally consistent and flexible.\n+    * A shiny [framework for Debug implementations][debug-builder] landed.\n+      This makes it possible to opt in to \"pretty-printed\" debugging output.\n+    * A new set of [generic conversion traits][conversion] replaced\n+      many existing ad hoc traits.\n+    * Generic numeric traits were\n+      [completely removed][num-traits]. This was made possible thanks\n+      to inherent methods for primitive types, and the removal gives\n+      maximal flexibility for designing a numeric hierarchy in the future.\n+    * The `Fn` traits are now related via [inheritance][fn-inherit]\n+      and provide ergonomic [blanket implementations][fn-blanket].\n+    * The `Index` and `IndexMut` traits were changed to\n+      [take the index by value][index-value], enabling code like\n+      `hash_map[\"string\"]` to work.\n+    * `Copy` now [inherits][copy-clone] from `Clone`, meaning that all\n+      `Copy` data is known to be `Clone` as well.\n+\n+* Infrastructure\n+\n+    * Metadata was tuned, shrinking binaries [by 27%][metadata-shrink].\n+    * Much headway was made on ecosystem-wide CI, making it possible\n+      to [compare builds for breakage][ci-compare].\n+\n+[send-rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0458-send-improvements.md\n+[scoped]: http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/std/thread/fn.scoped.html\n+[moar-ufcs]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/22172\n+[prim-inherent]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23104\n+[overflow]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/22532\n+[metadata-shrink]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/22971\n+[self-sized]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/22301\n+[assoc-where]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/22512\n+[string-pattern]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/22466\n+[oibit-final]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/21689\n+[reflect]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23712\n+[debug-builder]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0640-debug-improvements.md\n+[conversion]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/529\n+[num-traits]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23549\n+[index-value]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23601\n+[dropck]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/769\n+[fundamental]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1023\n+[ci-compare]: https://gist.github.com/brson/a30a77836fbec057cbee\n+[fn-inherit]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23282\n+[fn-blanket]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23895\n+[copy-clone]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23860\n+[path-normalize]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23229\n+\n Version 1.0.0-alpha.2 (February 2015)\n -------------------------------------\n "}]}
