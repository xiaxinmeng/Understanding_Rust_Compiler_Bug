This\nin turn caused the regression in #46271.\n\nThe bug here was that the resolver was producing `def_id` instances for\n\"possibly unused extern crates\" which would then later get processed during\ntypeck to actually issue lint warnings. The problem was that *after* resolution\nthese `def_id` nodes were actually removed from the AST by the \"everybody loops\"\npass. This later, when we tried to take a look at `def_id`, caused the compiler\nto panic.\n\nThe fix applied here is a bit of a heavy hammer which is to just, in this one\ncase, ignore the `extern crate` lints if the `def_id` looks \"bogus\" in any way\n(basically if it looks like the node was removed after resolution). The real\nunderlying bug here is probably that the \"everybody loops\" AST pass is being\nstressed to much beyond what it was originally intended to do, but this should\nat least fix the ICE for now...\n\nCloses #46271", "tree": {"sha": "914130863c32f37553779a7ba4f03fcb2b3b4aaa", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/914130863c32f37553779a7ba4f03fcb2b3b4aaa"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/4e74eb5ba0bbf60ab70a0680d1e07d7a0f59d383", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/4e74eb5ba0bbf60ab70a0680d1e07d7a0f59d383", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/4e74eb5ba0bbf60ab70a0680d1e07d7a0f59d383", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/4e74eb5ba0bbf60ab70a0680d1e07d7a0f59d383/comments", "author": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "4fa202d23b4c8c81b8ac6cf89cf843d35854d437", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/4fa202d23b4c8c81b8ac6cf89cf843d35854d437", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/4fa202d23b4c8c81b8ac6cf89cf843d35854d437"}], "stats": {"total": 34, "additions": 34, "deletions": 0}, "files": [{"sha": "f2f1e2938cb1283f65b4de5e3513d0197b92a0cd", "filename": "src/librustc_typeck/check_unused.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 19, "deletions": 0, "changes": 19, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/4e74eb5ba0bbf60ab70a0680d1e07d7a0f59d383/src%2Flibrustc_typeck%2Fcheck_unused.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/4e74eb5ba0bbf60ab70a0680d1e07d7a0f59d383/src%2Flibrustc_typeck%2Fcheck_unused.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Flibrustc_typeck%2Fcheck_unused.rs?ref=4e74eb5ba0bbf60ab70a0680d1e07d7a0f59d383", "patch": "@@ -75,6 +75,25 @@ pub fn check_crate<'a, 'tcx>(tcx: TyCtxt<'a, 'tcx, 'tcx>) {\n     tcx.hir.krate().visit_all_item_likes(&mut visitor);\n \n     for &(def_id, span) in tcx.maybe_unused_extern_crates(LOCAL_CRATE).iter() {\n+        // The `def_id` here actually was calculated during resolution (at least\n+        // at the time of this writing) and is being shipped to us via a side\n+        // channel of the tcx.
