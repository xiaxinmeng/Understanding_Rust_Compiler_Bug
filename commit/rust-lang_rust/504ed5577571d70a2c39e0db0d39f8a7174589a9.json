You can use the section headings above\n+to jump to any particular section.\n+\n+# Getting Started\n+\n+If you haven't seen Rust at all yet, the first thing you should read is the [30\n+minute intro](intro.html). It will give you an overview of the basic ideas of Rust\n+at a high level.\n+\n+Once you know you really want to learn Rust, the next step is reading [the\n+guide](guide.html). It is a lengthy explanation of Rust, its syntax, and its\n+concepts. Upon completing the guide, you'll be an intermediate Rust developer,\n+and will have a good grasp of the fundamental ideas behind Rust.\n+\n+# Community & Getting Help\n+\n+If you need help with something, or just want to talk about Rust with others,\n+there's a few places you can do that:\n+\n+The Rust IRC channels on [irc.mozilla.org](http://irc.mozilla.org/) are the\n+fastest way to get help.\n+[`#rust`](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust) is\n+the general discussion channel, and you'll find people willing to help you with\n+any questions you may have.\n+\n+There are also three specialty channels:\n+[`#rust-gamedev`](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust-gamedev)\n+and\n+[`#rust-osdev`](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust-osdev)\n+are for game development and operating system development, respectively.\n+There's also\n+[`#rust-internals`](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust-internals), which is for discussion of the development of Rust itself.\n+\n+You can also get help on [Stack\n+Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust). Searching for your\n+problem might reveal someone who has asked it before!\n+\n+There is an active [subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/rust) with lots of\n+discussion about Rust.\n+\n+There is also a [developer forum](http://discuss.rust-lang.org/), where the\n+development of Rust itself is discussed.\n \n-* [A 30-minute Intro to Rust](intro.html)\n-* [The Rust tutorial](tutorial.html)  (* [PDF](tutorial.pdf))\n-* [The Rust reference manual](rust.html) (* [PDF](rust.pdf))\n \n # Guides\n \n+Rust Guides are in-depth looks at a particular topic that's relevant to Rust\n+development.
