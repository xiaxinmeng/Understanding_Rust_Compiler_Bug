Remove enable/disable.\n\nDisable and enable when not specifically explained were not clear to me\nas an English language speaker, but I was able to figure it out fairly\neasily due to the examples having A/W, which I assumed meant `allow` and\n`warn`.  I removed both words to be sure it was clear as well as\nextending the note on what deny means.  It now includes a statement on\nexactly what each word means.\n\nDocumentation only update.\n\n*Please keep the line below*\nchangelog: none", "tree": {"sha": "41ec6563761582090247c87751cee6933ec37702", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/41ec6563761582090247c87751cee6933ec37702"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/3a34bc017d2e9334ed2ee3513b248003c2d90a5c", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/3a34bc017d2e9334ed2ee3513b248003c2d90a5c", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/3a34bc017d2e9334ed2ee3513b248003c2d90a5c", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/3a34bc017d2e9334ed2ee3513b248003c2d90a5c/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "225ce5ff588a500eea636ecb1bd53245e9adc386", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/225ce5ff588a500eea636ecb1bd53245e9adc386", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/225ce5ff588a500eea636ecb1bd53245e9adc386"}, {"sha": "cf2043d4a255b589f329e0727ef2e3a10e1a401d", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/cf2043d4a255b589f329e0727ef2e3a10e1a401d", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/cf2043d4a255b589f329e0727ef2e3a10e1a401d"}], "stats": {"total": 15, "additions": 9, "deletions": 6}, "files": [{"sha": "8a5975e1f9711b25878cc04d41d7215f3562b3be", "filename": "README.md", "status": "modified", "additions": 9, "deletions": 6, "changes": 15, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3a34bc017d2e9334ed2ee3513b248003c2d90a5c/README.md", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/3a34bc017d2e9334ed2ee3513b248003c2d90a5c/README.md", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/README.md?ref=3a34bc017d2e9334ed2ee3513b248003c2d90a5c", "patch": "@@ -167,18 +167,21 @@ You can add options to your code to `allow`/`warn`/`deny` Clippy lints:\n \n *   `allow`/`warn`/`deny` can be limited to a single function or module using `#[allow(...)]`, etc.\n \n-Note: `deny` produces errors instead of warnings.\n+Note: `allow` means to suppress the lint for your code.
