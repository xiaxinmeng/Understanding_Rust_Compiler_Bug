The Rust core library\n+//!\n+//! This library is meant to represent the core functionality of rust that is\n+//! maximally portable to other platforms. To that exent, this library has no\n+//! knowledge of things like allocation, threads, I/O, etc. This library is\n+//! built on the assumption of a few existing symbols:\n+//!\n+//! * `memcpy`, `memcmp`, `memset` - These are core memory routines which are\n+//!   often generated by LLVM. Additionally, this library can make explicit\n+//!   calls to these funcitons. Their signatures are the same as found in C.\n+//!\n+//! * `rust_begin_unwind` - This function takes three arguments, a\n+//!   `&fmt::Arguments`, a `&str`, and a `uint. These three arguments dictate\n+//!   the failure message, the file at which failure was invoked, and the line.\n+//!   It is up to consumers of this core library to define this failure\n+//!   function; it is only required to never return.\n+//!\n+//! Currently, it is *not* recommended to use the core library. The stable\n+//! functionality of libcore is exported directly into the\n+//! [standard library](../std/index.html). The composition of this library is\n+//! subject to change over time, only the interface exposed through libstd is\n+//! intended to be stable.\n \n #![crate_id = \"core#0.11.0-pre\"]\n #![license = \"MIT/ASL2\"]"}]}
