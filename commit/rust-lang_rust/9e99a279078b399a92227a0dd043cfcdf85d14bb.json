For more comprehensive documentation see [the\n+website](https://www.rust-lang.org).\n \n-If you haven't seen Rust at all yet, the first thing you should read is the\n-introduction to [The Rust Programming Language](book/index.html). It'll give\n-you a good idea of what Rust is like.\n+[**The Rust Programming Language**](book/index.html)\n \n-The book provides a lengthy explanation of Rust, its syntax, and its\n-concepts. Upon completing the book, you'll be an intermediate Rust\n-developer, and will have a good grasp of the fundamental ideas behind\n-Rust.\n+[**The Rust Reference**](reference.html)\n \n-# Language Reference\n+[**The Standard Library API Reference**](std/index.html)\n \n-Rust does not have an exact specification yet, but an effort to describe as much of\n-the language in as much detail as possible is in [the reference](reference.html).\n+[**The Rustonomicon**](nomicon/index.html)\n \n-# Standard Library Reference\n-\n-We have [API documentation for the entire standard\n-library](std/index.html). There's a list of crates on the left with more\n-specific sections, or you can use the search bar at the top to search for\n-something if you know its name.\n-\n-# The Rustonomicon\n-\n-[The Rustonomicon] is an entire book dedicated to explaining\n-how to write `unsafe` Rust code. It is for advanced Rust programmers.\n-\n-[The Rustonomicon]: nomicon/index.html\n-\n-# The Error Index\n-\n-If you encounter an error while compiling your code you may be able to look it\n-up in the [Rust Compiler Error Index](error-index.html).\n+[**The Compiler Error Index**](error-index.html)"}]}
