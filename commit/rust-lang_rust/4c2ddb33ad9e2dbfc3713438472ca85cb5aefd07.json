A vanilla version of this function exposes the problem of exception safety by\n   allowing a bare try/catch in the language. It is not clear whether this\n   concern should be directly tied to `unsafe` in Rust at the API level. At this\n   time, however, the bounds on `ffi::try` require the closure to be both\n   `'static` and `Send` (mirroring those of `thread::spawn`). It may be possible\n   to relax the bounds in the future, but for now it's the level of safety that\n   we're willing to commit to.\n\n2. Panicking while panicking will leak resources by not running destructors.\n   Because panicking is still controlled by the standard library, safeguards\n   remain in place to prevent this from happening.\n\nThe new API is now called `catch_panic` and is marked as `#[unstable]` for now.", "tree": {"sha": "a4b0aca698a6d9d4b3f2b1a5ac45d8c6b55dc96a", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/a4b0aca698a6d9d4b3f2b1a5ac45d8c6b55dc96a"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/4c2ddb33ad9e2dbfc3713438472ca85cb5aefd07", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/4c2ddb33ad9e2dbfc3713438472ca85cb5aefd07", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/4c2ddb33ad9e2dbfc3713438472ca85cb5aefd07", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/4c2ddb33ad9e2dbfc3713438472ca85cb5aefd07/comments", "author": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "ed810385045ab0db90303574ba3ea47dfa2a36d5", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/ed810385045ab0db90303574ba3ea47dfa2a36d5", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/ed810385045ab0db90303574ba3ea47dfa2a36d5"}], "stats": {"total": 49, "additions": 49, "deletions": 0}, "files": [{"sha": "7e96745d225583e750929836a6e4e8c8142fdcd1", "filename": "src/libstd/thread/mod.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 49, "deletions": 0, "changes": 49, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/4c2ddb33ad9e2dbfc3713438472ca85cb5aefd07/src%2Flibstd%2Fthread%2Fmod.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/4c2ddb33ad9e2dbfc3713438472ca85cb5aefd07/src%2Flibstd%2Fthread%2Fmod.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Flibstd%2Fthread%2Fmod.rs?ref=4c2ddb33ad9e2dbfc3713438472ca85cb5aefd07", "patch": "@@ -434,6 +434,55 @@ pub fn panicking() -> bool {\n     unwind::panicking()\n }\n \n+/// Invoke a closure, capturing the cause of panic if one occurs.\n+///\n+/// This function will return `Ok(())` if the closure does not panic, and will\n+/// return `Err(cause)` if the closure panics.
