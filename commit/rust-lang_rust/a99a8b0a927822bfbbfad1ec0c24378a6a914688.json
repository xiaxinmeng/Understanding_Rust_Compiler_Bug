Subsequent statements within a function may or may not initialize the\n local variables. Local variables can be used only after they have been\n initialized; this is enforced by the compiler.\n \n-# Runtime services, linkage and debugging\n-\n-The Rust _runtime_ is a relatively compact collection of Rust code that\n-provides fundamental services and datatypes to all Rust threads at run-time. It\n-is smaller and simpler than many modern language runtimes. It is tightly\n-integrated into the language's execution model of memory, threads, communication\n-and logging.\n-\n-### Memory allocation\n-\n-The runtime memory-management system is based on a _service-provider\n-interface_, through which the runtime requests blocks of memory from its\n-environment and releases them back to its environment when they are no longer\n-needed. The default implementation of the service-provider interface consists\n-of the C runtime functions `malloc` and `free`.\n-\n-The runtime memory-management system, in turn, supplies Rust threads with\n-facilities for allocating releasing stacks, as well as allocating and freeing\n-heap data.\n-\n-### Built in types\n-\n-The runtime provides C and Rust code to assist with various built-in types,\n-such as arrays, strings, and the low level communication system (ports,\n-channels, threads).\n-\n-Support for other built-in types such as simple types, tuples and enums is\n-open-coded by the Rust compiler.\n-\n-### Thread scheduling and communication\n-\n-The runtime provides code to manage inter-thread communication. This includes\n-the system of thread-lifecycle state transitions depending on the contents of\n-queues, as well as code to copy values between queues and their recipients and\n-to serialize values for transmission over operating-system inter-process\n-communication facilities.\n-\n-### Linkage\n+# Linkage\n \n The Rust compiler supports various methods to link crates together both\n statically and dynamically.
