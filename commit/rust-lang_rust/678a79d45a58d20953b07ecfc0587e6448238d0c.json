Great to see your interest in compiler internals and lints!\n+\n+## Getting started\n+\n+All issues on Clippy are mentored, if you want help with a bug just ask @Manishearth or @llogiq.\n+\n+Some issues are easier than others. The [E-easy](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/labels/E-easy)\n+label can be used to find the easy issues. If you want to work on an issue, please leave a comment\n+so that we can assign it to you!\n+\n+Issues marked [T-AST](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/labels/T-AST) involve simple\n+matching of the syntax tree structure, and are generally easier than\n+[T-middle](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/labels/T-middle) issues, which involve types\n+and resolved paths.\n+\n+Issues marked [E-medium](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/labels/E-medium) are generally\n+pretty easy too, though it's recommended you work on an E-easy issue first.\n+\n+[Llogiq's blog post on lints](https://llogiq.github.io/2015/06/04/workflows.html) is a nice primer\n+to lint-writing, though it does get into advanced stuff. Most lints consist of an implementation of\n+`LintPass` with one or more of its default methods overridden. See the existing lints for examples\n+of this.\n+\n+T-AST issues will generally need you to match against a predefined syntax structure. To figure out\n+how this syntax structure is encoded in the AST, it is recommended to run `rustc -Z ast-json` on an\n+example of the structure and compare with the\n+[nodes in the AST docs](http://manishearth.github.io/rust-internals-docs/syntax/ast/). Usually\n+the lint will end up to be a nested series of matches and ifs,\n+[like so](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy/blob/de5ccdfab68a5e37689f3c950ed1532ba9d652a0/src/misc.rs#L34)\n+\n+T-middle issues can be more involved and require verifying types. The\n+[`middle::ty`](http://manishearth.github.io/rust-internals-docs/rustc/middle/ty) module contains a\n+lot of methods that are useful, though one of the most useful would be `expr_ty` (gives the type of\n+an AST expression). `match_def_path()` in Clippy's `utils` module can also be useful.\n+\n+## Contributions\n+\n+Clippy welcomes contributions from everyone.\n+\n+Contributions to Clippy should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests. Each pull request will\n+be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with permission to land patches) and either landed in the\n+main tree or given feedback for changes that would be required.\n+\n+## Conduct\n+\n+We follow the [Rust Code of Conduct](http://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html).\n+\n+\n+<! -- adapted from https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md -->\n\\ No newline at end of file"}]}
