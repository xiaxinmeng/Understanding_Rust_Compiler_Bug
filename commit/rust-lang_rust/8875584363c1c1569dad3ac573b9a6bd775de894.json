The *length* of a word should be a familiar\n+    notion, and here we denote it for any word x by |x|.\n+    (We also allow for the possibility of the *empty word*, a word of length zero).\n+\n+    If x is any non-empty word, then an integer p with 0 < p <= |x| is said to be a\n+    *period* for x iff for all i with 0 <= i <= |x| - p - 1, we have x[i] == x[i+p].\n+    For example, both 1 and 2 are periods for the string \"aa\". As another example,\n+    the only period of the string \"abcd\" is 4.\n+\n+    We denote by period(x) the *smallest* period of x (provided that x is non-empty).\n+    This is always well-defined since every non-empty word x has at least one period,\n+    |x|. We sometimes call this *the period* of x.\n+\n+    If u, v and x are words such that x = uv, where uv is the concatenation of u and\n+    v, then we say that (u, v) is a *factorization* of x.\n+\n+    Let (u, v) be a factorization for a word x. Then if w is a non-empty word such\n+    that both of the following hold\n+\n+      - either w is a suffix of u or u is a suffix of w\n+      - either w is a prefix of v or v is a prefix of w\n+\n+    then w is said to be a *repetition* for the factorization (u, v).\n+\n+    Just to unpack this, there are four possibilities here. Let w = \"abc\". Then we\n+    might have:\n+\n+      - w is a suffix of u and w is a prefix of v. ex: (\"lolabc\", \"abcde\")\n+      - w is a suffix of u and v is a prefix of w. ex: (\"lolabc\", \"ab\")\n+      - u is a suffix of w and w is a prefix of v. ex: (\"bc\", \"abchi\")\n+      - u is a suffix of w and v is a prefix of w. ex: (\"bc\", \"a\")\n+\n+    Note that the word vu is a repetition for any factorization (u,v) of x = uv,\n+    so every factorization has at least one repetition.\n+\n+    If x is a string and (u, v) is a factorization for x, then a *local period* for\n+    (u, v) is an integer r such that there is some word w such that |w| = r and w is\n+    a repetition for (u, v).\n+\n+    We denote by local_period(u, v) the smallest local period of (u, v). We sometimes\n+    call this *the local period* of (u, v). Provided that x = uv is non-empty, this\n+    is well-defined (because each non-empty word has at least one factorization, as\n+    noted above).\n+\n+    It can be proven that the following is an equivalent definition of a local period\n+    for a factorization (u, v): any positive integer r such that x[i] == x[i+r] for\n+    all i such that |u| - r <= i <= |u| - 1 and such that both x[i] and x[i+r] are\n+    defined. (i.e. i > 0 and i + r < |x|).\n+\n+    Using the above reformulation, it is easy to prove that\n+\n+        1 <= local_period(u, v) <= period(uv)\n+\n+    A factorization (u, v) of x such that local_period(u,v) = period(x) is called a\n+    *critical factorization*.\n+\n+    The algorithm hinges on the following theorem, which is stated without proof:\n+\n+    **Critical Factorization Theorem** Any word x has at least one critical\n+    factorization (u, v) such that |u| < period(x).\n+\n+    The purpose of maximal_suffix is to find such a critical factorization.\n+\n+*/\n impl TwoWaySearcher {\n     fn new(needle: &[u8]) -> TwoWaySearcher {\n         let (crit_pos1, period1) = TwoWaySearcher::maximal_suffix(needle, false);\n@@ -436,15 +504,19 @@ impl TwoWaySearcher {\n             period = period2;\n         }\n \n+        // This isn't in the original algorithm, as far as I'm aware.\n         let byteset = needle.iter()\n                             .fold(0, |a, &b| (1 << ((b & 0x3f) as uint)) | a);\n \n-        // The logic here (calculating crit_pos and period, the final if statement to see which\n-        // period to use for the TwoWaySearcher) is essentially an implementation of the\n-        // \"small-period\" function from the paper (p. 670)\n+        // A particularly readable explanation of what's going on here can be found\n+        // in Crochemore and Rytter's book \"Text Algorithms\", ch 13.
