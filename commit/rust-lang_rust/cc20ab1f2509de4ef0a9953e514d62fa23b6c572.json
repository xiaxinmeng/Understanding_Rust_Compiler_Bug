This has been noted in a couple places:  #32677, #37045.\n\nThere has been some discussion about how to fix this problem in #32677, but no solution seems likely to land in the near future. For now, anyone who wishes to have robust error handling must remember to manually call `flush()` on a `BufWriter` before it is dropped.  Until a permanent fix is in place, it seems worthwhile to add a warning to that effect to the documentation.", "tree": {"sha": "ba585ca57d0bd959a72679ff74f26c72181130ed", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/ba585ca57d0bd959a72679ff74f26c72181130ed"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/cc20ab1f2509de4ef0a9953e514d62fa23b6c572", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/cc20ab1f2509de4ef0a9953e514d62fa23b6c572", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/cc20ab1f2509de4ef0a9953e514d62fa23b6c572", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/cc20ab1f2509de4ef0a9953e514d62fa23b6c572/comments", "author": {"login": "Mark-Simulacrum", "id": 5047365, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDczNjU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047365?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mark-Simulacrum", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mark-Simulacrum/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "web-flow", "id": 19864447, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODY0NDQ3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow", "html_url": "https://github.com/web-flow", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "6aeb0f0b2ed6d9577f741d27e9007b7f787557fa", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/6aeb0f0b2ed6d9577f741d27e9007b7f787557fa", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/6aeb0f0b2ed6d9577f741d27e9007b7f787557fa"}, {"sha": "c6b280e0396780179a20776b55e3fa4cf4b1a513", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/c6b280e0396780179a20776b55e3fa4cf4b1a513", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c6b280e0396780179a20776b55e3fa4cf4b1a513"}], "stats": {"total": 6, "additions": 5, "deletions": 1}, "files": [{"sha": "1b832453523fb8f747eb91100a8d1dd829b59717", "filename": "src/libstd/io/buffered.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 5, "deletions": 1, "changes": 6, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/cc20ab1f2509de4ef0a9953e514d62fa23b6c572/src%2Flibstd%2Fio%2Fbuffered.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/cc20ab1f2509de4ef0a9953e514d62fa23b6c572/src%2Flibstd%2Fio%2Fbuffered.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Flibstd%2Fio%2Fbuffered.rs?ref=cc20ab1f2509de4ef0a9953e514d62fa23b6c572", "patch": "@@ -276,7 +276,10 @@ impl<R: Seek> Seek for BufReader<R> {\n /// `BufWriter` keeps an in-memory buffer of data and writes it to an underlying\n /// writer in large, infrequent batches.\n ///\n-/// The buffer will be written out when the writer is dropped.\n+/// When the `BufWriter` is dropped, the contents of its buffer will be written\n+/// out.
