Here is an example:\n+\n+```rust,ignore\n+extern crate phrases as sayings;\n+\n+use sayings::japanese::greetings as ja_greetings;\n+use sayings::japanese::farewells::*;\n+use sayings::english::{self, greetings as en_greetings, farewells as en_farewells};\n+\n+fn main() {\n+    println!(\"Hello in English; {}\", en_greetings::hello());\n+    println!(\"And in Japanese: {}\", ja_greetings::hello());\n+    println!(\"Goodbye in English: {}\", english::farewells::goodbye());\n+    println!(\"Again: {}\", en_farewells::goodbye());\n+    println!(\"And in Japanese: {}\", goodbye());\n+}\n+```\n+\n+What's going on here?\n+\n+First, both `extern crate` and `use` allow renaming the thing that is being\n+imported. So the crate is still called \"phrases\", but here we will refer\n+to it as \"sayings\". Similarly, the first `use` statement pulls in the\n+`japanese::farewells` module from the crate, but makes it available as\n+`jp_farewells` as opposed to simply `farewells`. This can help to avoid\n+ambiguity when importing similarly-named items from different places.\n+\n+The second `use` statement uses a star glob to bring in _all_ symbols from the\n+`sayings::japanese::farewells` module. As you can see we can later refer to\n+the Japanese `goodbye` function with no module qualifiers. This kind of glob\n+should be used sparingly.\n+\n+The third `use` statement bears more explanation. It's using \"brace expansion\"\n+globbing to compress three `use` statements into one (this sort of syntax\n+may be familiar if you've written Linux shell scripts before). The\n+uncompressed form of this statement would be:\n+```rust,ignore\n+use sayings::english;\n+use sayings::english::greetings as en_greetings;\n+use sayings::english::farewells as en_farewells;\n+```\n+As you can see, the curly brackets compress `use` statements for several items\n+under the same path, and in this context `self` just refers back to that path.\n+Note: The curly brackets cannot be nested or mixed with star globbing."}]}
