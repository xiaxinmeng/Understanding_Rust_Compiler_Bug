Types\n+\n+Associated types are a powerful part of Rust's type system. They're related to\n+the idea of a 'type family', in other words, grouping multiple types together. That\n+description is a bit abstract, so let's dive right into an example. If you want\n+to write a `Graph` trait, you have two types to be generic over: the node type\n+and the edge type. So you might write a trait, `Graph<N, E>`, that looks like\n+this:\n+\n+```rust\n+trait Graph<N, E> {\n+    fn has_edge(&self, &N, &N) -> bool;\n+    fn edges(&self, &N) -> Vec<E>;\n+    // etc\n+}\n+```\n+\n+While this sort of works, it ends up being awkward. For example, any function\n+that wants to take a `Graph` as a parameter now _also_ needs to be generic over\n+the `N`ode and `E`dge types too:\n+\n+```rust,ignore\n+fn distance<N, E, G: Graph<N, E>>(graph: &G, start: &N, end: &N) -> u32 { ... }\n+```\n+\n+Our distance calculation works regardless of our `Edge` type, so the `E` stuff in\n+this signature is just a distraction.\n+\n+What we really want to say is that a certain `E`dge and `N`ode type come together\n+to form each kind of `Graph`. We can do that with associated types:\n+\n+```rust\n+trait Graph {\n+    type N;\n+    type E;\n+\n+    fn has_edge(&self, &Self::N, &Self::N) -> bool;\n+    fn edges(&self, &Self::N) -> Vec<Self::E>;\n+    // etc\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Now, our clients can be abstract over a given `Graph`:\n+\n+```rust,ignore\n+fn distance<G: Graph>(graph: &G, start: &G::N, end: &G::N) -> uint { ... }\n+```\n+\n+No need to deal with the `E`dge type here!\n+\n+Let's go over all this in more detail.\n+\n+## Defining associated types\n+\n+Let's build that `Graph` trait. Here's the definition:\n+\n+```rust\n+trait Graph {\n+    type N;\n+    type E;\n+\n+    fn has_edge(&self, &Self::N, &Self::N) -> bool;\n+    fn edges(&self, &Self::N) -> Vec<Self::E>;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Simple enough. Associated types use the `type` keyword, and go inside the body\n+of the trait, with the functions.\n+\n+These `type` declarations can have all the same thing as functions do. For example,\n+if we wanted our `N` type to implement `Display`, so we can print the nodes out,\n+we could do this:\n+\n+```rust\n+use std::fmt;\n+\n+trait Graph {\n+    type N: fmt::Display;\n+    type E;\n+\n+    fn has_edge(&self, &Self::N, &Self::N) -> bool;\n+    fn edges(&self, &Self::N) -> Vec<Self::E>;\n+}\n+```\n+\n+## Implementing associated types\n+\n+Just like any trait, traits that use associated types use the `impl` keyword to\n+provide implementations. Here's a simple implementation of Graph:\n+\n+```rust\n+# trait Graph {\n+#     type N;\n+#     type E;\n+#     fn has_edge(&self, &Self::N, &Self::N) -> bool;\n+#     fn edges(&self, &Self::N) -> Vec<Self::E>;\n+# }\n+struct Node;\n+\n+struct Edge;\n+\n+struct MyGraph;\n+\n+impl Graph for MyGraph {\n+    type N = Node;\n+    type E = Edge;\n+\n+    fn has_edge(&self, n1: &Node, n2: &Node) -> bool {\n+        true\n+    }\n+\n+    fn edges(&self, n: &Node) -> Vec<Edge> {\n+        Vec::new()\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This silly implementation always returns `true` and an empty `Vec<Edge>`, but it\n+gives you an idea of how to implement this kind of thing. We first need three\n+`struct`s, one for the graph, one for the node, and one for the edge. If it made\n+more sense to use a different type, that would work as well, we're just going to\n+use `struct`s for all three here.\n+\n+Next is the `impl` line, which is just like implementing any other trait.\n+\n+From here, we use `=` to define our associated types. The name the trait uses\n+goes on the left of the `=`, and the concrete type we're `impl`ementing this\n+for goes on the right. Finally, we use the concrete types in our function\n+declarations.\n+\n+## Trait objects with associated types\n+\n+There\u2019s one more bit of syntax we should talk about: trait objects. If you\n+try to create a trait object from an associated type, like this:\n+\n+```rust,ignore\n+# trait Graph {\n+#     type N;\n+#     type E;\n+#     fn has_edge(&self, &Self::N, &Self::N) -> bool;\n+#     fn edges(&self, &Self::N) -> Vec<Self::E>;\n+# }\n+# struct Node;\n+# struct Edge;\n+# struct MyGraph;\n+# impl Graph for MyGraph {\n+#     type N = Node;\n+#     type E = Edge;\n+#     fn has_edge(&self, n1: &Node, n2: &Node) -> bool {\n+#         true\n+#     }\n+#     fn edges(&self, n: &Node) -> Vec<Edge> {\n+#         Vec::new()\n+#     }\n+# }\n+let graph = MyGraph;\n+let obj = Box::new(graph) as Box<Graph>;\n+```\n+\n+You\u2019ll get two errors:\n+\n+```text\n+error: the value of the associated type `E` (from the trait `main::Graph`) must\n+be specified [E0191]\n+let obj = Box::new(graph) as Box<Graph>;\n+          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+24:44 error: the value of the associated type `N` (from the trait\n+`main::Graph`) must be specified [E0191]\n+let obj = Box::new(graph) as Box<Graph>;\n+          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+```\n+\n+We can\u2019t create a trait object like this, becuase we don\u2019t know the associated\n+types. Instead, we can write this:\n+\n+```rust\n+# trait Graph {\n+#     type N;\n+#     type E;\n+#     fn has_edge(&self, &Self::N, &Self::N) -> bool;\n+#     fn edges(&self, &Self::N) -> Vec<Self::E>;\n+# }\n+# struct Node;\n+# struct Edge;\n+# struct MyGraph;\n+# impl Graph for MyGraph {\n+#     type N = Node;\n+#     type E = Edge;\n+#     fn has_edge(&self, n1: &Node, n2: &Node) -> bool {\n+#         true\n+#     }\n+#     fn edges(&self, n: &Node) -> Vec<Edge> {\n+#         Vec::new()\n+#     }\n+# }\n+let graph = MyGraph;\n+let obj = Box::new(graph) as Box<Graph<N=Node, E=Edge>>;\n+```\n+\n+The `N=Node` syntax allows us to provide a concrete type, `Node`, for the `N`\n+type parameter. Same with `E=Edge`. If we didn\u2019t proide this constraint, we\n+couldn\u2019t be sure which `impl` to match this trait object to."}]}
