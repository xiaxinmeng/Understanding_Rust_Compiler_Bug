`rustc_attrs`\n+\n+This feature has no tracking issue, and is therefore likely internal to\n+the compiler, not being intended for general use.\n+\n+------------------------\n+\n+The `rustc_attrs` feature allows debugging rustc type layouts by using\n+`#[rustc_layout(...)]` to debug layout at compile time (it even works\n+with `cargo check`) as an alternative to `rustc -Z print-type-sizes`\n+that is way more verbose.\n+\n+Options provided by `#[rustc_layout(...)]` are `debug`, `size`, `abi`.\n+Note that it only work best with sized type without generics.\n+\n+## Examples\n+\n+```rust\n+#![feature(rustc_attrs)]\n+\n+#[rustc_layout(abi, size)]\n+pub enum X {\n+    Y(u8, u8, u8),\n+    Z(isize),\n+}\n+```\n+\n+When that is compiled, the compiler will error with something like\n+\n+```\n+error: abi: Aggregate { sized: true }\n+ --> src/lib.rs:4:1\n+  |\n+4 | / pub enum T {\n+5 | |     Y(u8, u8, u8),\n+6 | |     Z(isize),\n+7 | | }\n+  | |_^\n+\n+error: size:
