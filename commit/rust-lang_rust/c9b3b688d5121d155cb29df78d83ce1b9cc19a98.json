Still, some\n-things (like adding support for a new intrinsic or a shim for an external\n-function being called) can be done by working just on the Miri side.\n-\n-To prepare, make sure you are using a nightly Rust compiler.  You also need to\n-have the `rust-src` and `rustc-dev` components installed, which you can add via\n-`rustup component add rust-src rustc-dev`.  Then you should be able to just\n-`cargo build` Miri.\n-\n-In case this fails, your nightly might be incompatible with Miri master.  The\n-`rust-version` file contains the commit hash of rustc that Miri is currently\n-tested against; you can use that to find a nightly that works or you might have\n-to wait for the next nightly to get released.

So you\n-have to run `cargo update` every now and then yourself to make sure you are\n-using the latest versions of everything (which is what gets tested on CI).\n+Now try `./miri test`, and submit a PR once that works again.\n \n ## Testing the Miri driver\n [testing-miri]: #testing-the-miri-driver"}, {"sha": "043b2ee2edd7b147d9d07ab8126fe20662c7be9c", "filename": "toolchain", "status": "added", "additions": 40, "deletions": 0, "changes": 40, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/c9b3b688d5121d155cb29df78d83ce1b9cc19a98/toolchain", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/c9b3b688d5121d155cb29df78d83ce1b9cc19a98/toolchain", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/toolchain?ref=c9b3b688d5121d155cb29df78d83ce1b9cc19a98", "patch": "@@ -0,0 +1,40 @@\n+#!/bin/bash\n+set -e\n+# Manages a rustup toolchain called \"miri\".\n+#\n+# All commands set \"miri\" as the override toolchain for the current directory,\n+# and make the `rust-version` file match that toolchain.\n+#\n+# USAGE:\n+#\n+# ./toolchain: Update \"miri\" toolchain to match `rust-version` (the known-good version for this commit).\n+# \n+# ./toolchain HEAD: Update \"miri\" toolchain and `rust-version` file to latest rustc HEAD.\n+# \n+# ./toolchain $COMMIT: Update \"miri\" toolchain and `rust-version` file to match that commit.\n+\n+# Determine new commit.\n+if [[ \"$1\" == \"\" ]]; then\n+    NEW_COMMIT=$(cat rust-version)\n+elif [[ \"$1\" == \"HEAD\" ]]; then\n+    NEW_COMMIT=$(git ls-remote https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/ HEAD | cut -f 1)\n+else\n+    NEW_COMMIT=\"$1\"\n+fi\n+echo \"$NEW_COMMIT\" > rust-version\n+\n+# Check if we already are at that commit.\n+CUR_COMMIT=$(rustc +miri --version -v | egrep \"^commit-hash: \" | cut -d \" \" -f 2)\n+if [[ \"$CUR_COMMIT\" == \"$NEW_COMMIT\" ]]; then\n+    echo \"miri toolchain is already at commit $CUR_COMMIT.\"\n+    rustup override set miri\n+    exit 0\n+fi\n+\n+# Cleanup.\n+cargo +nightly clean # Use nightly cargo as miri toolchain might be broken.\n+rustup toolchain uninstall miri\n+\n+# Install and setup new toolchain.\n+rustup-toolchain-install-master -n miri -c rust-src -c rustc-dev -- \"$NEW_COMMIT\"\n+rustup override set miri"}]}
