That's a very nice side effect of contributing and getting feedback on reviews :blush:\n\nMoving on, there were a few things that I was unsure about:\n* The PR rust-lang/rust#86717 changes an old entry in the change log, is this worth mentioning? I've left it out for now.\n* The stabilization of `cargo clippy --fix` is quite awesome and important IMO. It sadly gets a bit lost in the *Other* entry, as it's the last one. Do we maybe want to move it somewhere else or change the headline order for this release?\n* I've listed the introduction of the new `suspicious` group under the *Moves and Deprecations* section. Is this alright, or should it be moved to the *Other* section as well?\n* Last but definitely not least, some fun! I've used the :tada: emoji in the `cargo clippy --fix` entry, is this okay?\n\nSorry for the bombardment of questions xD\n\n---\n\nThe PR already includes the entries for the new metadata collection and website updates. These are not merged yet, but should probably be to make this correct. This might also require the commit hashes to be updated (Not sure on this, though). It would actually be super fitting to get this into this release as we also stabilize `--fix`. TODOs:\n* [x] Merge metadata collection PRs:\n  1. #7279\n  2. #7298\n  3. #7420 (Hope to not get any merge conflicts)\n\n---\n\n[Rendered
