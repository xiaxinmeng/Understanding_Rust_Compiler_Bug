The ownership system in Rust does this through a concept called\n-lifetimes, which describe the scope that a reference is valid for.\n+three. In the small example above the Rust compiler is able to report the issue\n+as it can see the lifetimes of the various values in the function.\n+\n+When we have a function that takes arguments by reference the situation becomes\n+more complex. Consider the following example:\n+\n+```rust,compile_fail,E0106\n+fn skip_prefix(line: &str, prefix: &str) -> &str {\n+    // ...\n+#   line\n+}\n+\n+let line = \"lang:en=Hello World!\";\n+let lang = \"en\";\n+\n+let v;\n+{\n+    let p = format!(\"lang:{}=\", lang);  // -+ p goes into scope\n+    v = skip_prefix(line, p.as_str());  //  |\n+}                                       // -+ p goes out of scope\n+println!(\"{}\", v);\n+```\n+\n+Here we have a function `skip_prefix` which takes two `&str` references\n+as parameters and returns a single `&str` reference. We call it\n+by passing in references to `line` and `p`: Two variables with different\n+lifetimes. Now the safety of the `println!`-line depends on whether the\n+reference returned by `skip_prefix` function references the still living\n+`line` or the already dropped `p` string.\n+\n+Because of the above ambiguity, Rust will refuse to compile the example\n+code. To get it to compile we need to tell the compiler more about the\n+lifetimes of the references. This can be done by making the lifetimes\n+explicit in the function declaration:\n+\n+```rust\n+fn skip_prefix<'a, 'b>(line: &'a str, prefix: &'b str) -> &'a str {\n+    // ...\n+#   line\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Let's examine the changes without going too deep into the syntax for now -\n+we'll get to that later. The first change was adding the `<'a, 'b>` after the\n+method name. This introduces two lifetime parameters: `'a` and `'b`. Next each\n+reference in the function signature was associated with one of the lifetime\n+parameters by adding the lifetime name after the `&`. This tells the compiler\n+how the lifetimes between different references are related.\n+\n+As a result the compiler is now able to deduce that the return value of\n+`skip_prefix` has the same lifetime as the `line` parameter, which makes the `v`\n+reference safe to use even after the `p` goes out of scope in the original\n+example.\n+\n+In addition to the compiler being able to validate the usage of `skip_prefix`\n+return value, it can also ensure that the implementation follows the contract\n+established by the function declaration. This is useful especially when you are\n+implementing traits that are introduced [later in the book][traits].\n \n **Note** It's important to understand that lifetime annotations are\n _descriptive_, not _prescriptive_.
