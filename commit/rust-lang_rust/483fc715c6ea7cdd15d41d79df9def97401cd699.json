With the\n`make dist` support added in #32237 we should be able to produce standard\nrustc/rust-std packages for FreeBSD through a new slave with this cross compiler.\n\nCurrently, however, we don't \"Just Work\" when cross compiling FreeBSD and a\nnumber of changes were required (part of this PR). They include:\n\n* A few build fixes were needed in LLVM. Our own branch has been rebased on the\n  actual 3.8 release and I applied one extra commit [2] which contains two fixes:\n\n  1. The LLVM CMake build system passes the `-Wl,-z,defs` flag on many\n     platforms, but *not* when `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` is \"FreeBSD\". Unfortunately\n     this doesn't take into account when we're cross compiling, and as predicted\n     the build will fail if `-Wl,-z,defs` is passed (see [3] for more info). To\n     fix this we test `TARGET_TRIPLE` instead of the `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` which\n     is what we're compiling for which fixes the problem.\n  2. The `PATH_MAX` constant is apparently defined in a different location than\n     many other Unix systems, so a file which required this just needed some\n     help to keep compiling.\n\n* Support for compiling compiler-rt with CMake has been added to rustbuild. It\n  looks like it just emulates Linux in what it compiles as it didn't seem to\n  naturally produce anything else... At least the architecture is right, so\n  seems good for now at least!\n\n[1]: https://github.com/alexcrichton/port-of-rust/blob/master/prebuilt/freebsd/Dockerfile\n[2]:
