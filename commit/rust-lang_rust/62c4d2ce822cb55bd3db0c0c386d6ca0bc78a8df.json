As such, source builds require that:\n+\n+    * You are connected to the internet, to fetch snapshots.\n+\n+    * You can at least execute snapshot binaries of one of the forms we offer\n+      them in. Currently we build and test snapshots on:\n+        * Windows (7, server 2008 r2) x86 only\n+        * Linux 2.6.x (various distributions) x86 and x86-64\n+        * OSX 10.6 (\"Snow leopard\") or 10.7 (\"Lion\") x86 and x86-64\n+\n+You may find other platforms work, but these are our \"tier 1\" supported build\n+environments that are most likely to work. Further platforms will be added to\n+the list in the future via cross-compilation.\n+\n+To build from source you will also need the following prerequisite packages:\n+\n+    * g++ 4.4 or clang++ 3.x\n+    * python 2.6 or later\n+    * perl 5.0 or later\n+    * gnu make 3.81 or later\n+    * curl\n+\n+\n+Building and installing\n+=========================\n+\n+Assuming you're on a relatively modern Linux/OSX system and have met the\n+prerequisites, something along these lines should work:\n+\n+    $ tar -xzf rust-0.1.tar.gz\n+    $ cd rust-0.1\n+    $ ./configure\n+    $ make && make install\n+\n+When complete, make install will place the following programs into\n+/usr/local/bin:\n+\n+    * rustc, the Rust compiler\n+    * rustdoc, the API-documentation tool\n+    * cargo, the Rust package manager\n+\n+In addition to a manual page under /usr/local/share/man and a set of host and\n+target libraries under /usr/local/lib/rustc.\n+\n+The install locations can be adjusted by passing a --prefix argument to\n+configure. Various other options are also supported, pass --help for more\n+information on them.\n+\n+\n+More help\n+=========================\n+\n+Be sure to check out the 'Getting started' page on the Rust wiki:\n+\n+    https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Doc-getting-started"}, {"sha": "82ba2a82a6808757eed21d1349d109cc70485dbf", "filename": "mk/dist.mk", "status": "modified", "additions": 1, "deletions": 0, "changes": 1, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/62c4d2ce822cb55bd3db0c0c386d6ca0bc78a8df/mk%2Fdist.mk", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/62c4d2ce822cb55bd3db0c0c386d6ca0bc78a8df/mk%2Fdist.mk", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/mk%2Fdist.mk?ref=62c4d2ce822cb55bd3db0c0c386d6ca0bc78a8df", "patch": "@@ -15,6 +15,7 @@ PKG_GITMODULES := $(S)src/libuv $(S)src/llvm\n \n PKG_FILES := \\\n     $(S)LICENSE.txt $(S)README.txt             \\\n+    $(S)INSTALL.txt                            \\\n     $(S)configure $(S)Makefile.in              \\\n     $(S)man                                    \\\n     $(S)doc                                    \\"}]}
