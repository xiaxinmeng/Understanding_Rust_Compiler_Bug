However, that failed to account for the use\ncase in FFI code when dealing with integer type aliases.\n\nThis commit reintroduces the methods as `#[stable]`, since this is\nessential functionality for 1.0.\n\nIt's unfortunate to freeze these as methods, but when we can provide\ninherent associated constants these methods can be deprecated.\n\nr? @sfackler\ncc @alexcrichton", "tree": {"sha": "6499761f61de410a62768b27a58a1994c23c0361", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/6499761f61de410a62768b27a58a1994c23c0361"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/fb4029f8eadbf77a8d7a53fadb58decf3a1a49bc", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/fb4029f8eadbf77a8d7a53fadb58decf3a1a49bc", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/fb4029f8eadbf77a8d7a53fadb58decf3a1a49bc", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/fb4029f8eadbf77a8d7a53fadb58decf3a1a49bc/comments", "author": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "d55ffa93585a611a2b66605dc54ec84b4142c545", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/d55ffa93585a611a2b66605dc54ec84b4142c545", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/d55ffa93585a611a2b66605dc54ec84b4142c545"}, {"sha": "c0f86a953ca1fb6e7af0378ea99b3d91f9d50e46", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/c0f86a953ca1fb6e7af0378ea99b3d91f9d50e46", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/c0f86a953ca1fb6e7af0378ea99b3d91f9d50e46"}], "stats": {"total": 20, "additions": 20, "deletions": 0}, "files": [{"sha": "4e458e993a0ce662b6f489b05428d1fb28404a62", "filename": "src/libcore/num/mod.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 20, "deletions": 0, "changes": 20, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/fb4029f8eadbf77a8d7a53fadb58decf3a1a49bc/src%2Flibcore%2Fnum%2Fmod.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/fb4029f8eadbf77a8d7a53fadb58decf3a1a49bc/src%2Flibcore%2Fnum%2Fmod.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Flibcore%2Fnum%2Fmod.rs?ref=fb4029f8eadbf77a8d7a53fadb58decf3a1a49bc", "patch": "@@ -819,6 +819,18 @@ macro_rules!
