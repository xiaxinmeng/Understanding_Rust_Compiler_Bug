On other\n+platforms you need to build from a [tarball][].\n+\n+If you're on windows, download and run the installer. It should install\n+a self-contained set of tools and libraries to `C:\\Program Files\\Rust`,\n+and add `C:\\Program Files\\Rust\\bin` to your `PATH` environment variable.\n+You should then be able to run the rust compiler as `rustc` directly\n+from the command line.\n+\n+We hope to be distributing binary packages for various other operating\n+systems at some point in the future, but at the moment only windows\n+binary installers are being made. Other operating systems must build\n+from \"source\".\n+\n+***Note:*** The Rust compiler is slightly unusual in that it is written\n+in Rust and therefore must be built by a precompiled \"snapshot\" version\n+of itself (made in an earlier state of development). As such, source\n+builds require that:\n+\n+  * You are connected to the internet, to fetch snapshots.\n+  * You can at least execute snapshot binaries of one of the forms we\n+    offer them in. Currently we build and test snapshots on:\n+    * Windows (7, server 2008 r2) x86 only\n+    * Linux 2.6.x (various distributions) x86 and x86-64\n+    * OSX 10.6 (\"Snow leopard\") or 10.7 (\"Lion\") x86 and x86-64\n+\n+You may find other platforms work, but these are our \"tier 1\" supported\n+build environments that are most likely to work. Further platforms will\n+be added to the list in the future via cross-compilation.\n+\n+To build from source you will also need the following prerequisite\n+packages:\n+\n+  * g++ 4.4 or clang++ 3.x\n+  * python 2.6 or later\n+  * perl 5.0 or later\n+  * gnu make 3.81 or later\n+  * curl\n+\n+Assuming you're on a relatively modern Linux system and have met the\n+prerequisites, something along these lines should work:\n+\n+~~~~\n+## notrust\n+$ wget http://dl.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-0.1.tar.gz\n+$ tar -xzf rust-0.1.tar.gz\n+$ cd rust-0.1\n+$ ./configure\n+$ make && make install\n+~~~~\n+\n+When complete, `make install` will place the following programs into\n+`/usr/local/bin`:\n+\n+  * `rustc`, the Rust compiler\n+  * `rustdoc`, the API-documentation tool \n+  * `cargo`, the Rust package manager\n+\n+In addition to a manual page under `/usr/local/share/man` and\n+a set of host and target libraries under `/usr/local/lib/rustc`.\n+\n+The install locations can be adjusted by passing a `--prefix` argument\n+to `configure`. Various other options are also supported, pass `--help`\n+for more information on them. \n+\n+[installer]: http://dl.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-0.1-installer.exe\n+[tarball]: http://dl.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-0.1.tar.gz\n \n ## Compiling your first program\n "}]}
