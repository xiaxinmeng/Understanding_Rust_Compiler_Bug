In contrast, Rust, like C and C++, represents such types directly.\n-Another way to say this is that aggregate data in Rust are *unboxed*. This\n-means that if you `let x = Point { x: 1f, y: 1f };`, you are creating a struct\n-on the stack. If you then copy it into a data structure, you copy the entire\n-struct, not just a pointer.\n+A value in Rust is stored directly inside the owner. If a `struct` contains\n+four `int` fields, it will be four times as large as a single `int`.  The\n+following `struct` type is invalid, as it would have an infinite size:\n \n-For small structs like `Point`, this is usually more efficient than allocating\n-memory and indirecting through a pointer. But for big structs, or mutable\n-state, it can be useful to have a single copy on the stack or on the heap, and\n-refer to that through a pointer.\n+~~~~ {.xfail-test}\n+struct List {\n+    next: Option<List>,\n+    data: int\n+}\n+~~~~\n+\n+> ***Note:*** The `Option` type is an enum representing an *optional* value.\n+> It's comparable to a nullable pointer in many other languages, but stores the\n+> contained value unboxed.\n+\n+An *owned box* (`~`) uses a heap allocation to provide the invariant of always\n+being the size of a pointer, regardless of the contained type.

Rust's trait-based generics system (covered later in\n+the tutorial) is usually used for static dispatch, but also provides dynamic\n+dispatch via boxing. Values of different types may have different sizes, but a\n+box is able to *erase* the difference via the layer of indirection they\n+provide.\n \n-## Owned boxes\n+In uncommon cases, the indirection can provide a performance gain or memory\n+reduction by making values smaller. However, unboxed values should almost\n+always be preferred.\n \n-An owned box (`~`) is a uniquely owned allocation on the heap. It inherits the\n-mutability and lifetime of the owner as it would if there was no box:\n+Note that returning large unboxed values via boxes is unnecessary. A large\n+value is returned via a hidden output parameter, and the decision on where to\n+place the return value should be left to the caller:\n+\n+~~~~\n+fn foo() -> (int, int, int, int, int, int) {\n+    (5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5)\n+}\n+\n+let x = ~foo(); // allocates, and writes the integers directly to it\n+~~~~\n+\n+Beyond the properties granted by the size, an owned box behaves as a regular\n+value by inheriting the mutability and lifetime of the owner:\n \n ~~~~\n let x = 5; // immutable\n@@ -950,35 +988,33 @@ let mut y = ~5; // mutable\n *y += 2; // the * operator is needed to access the contained value\n ~~~~\n \n-The purpose of an owned box is to add a layer of indirection in order to create\n-recursive data structures or cheaply pass around an object larger than a\n-pointer. Since an owned box has a unique owner, it can only be used to\n-represent a tree data structure.\n+As covered earlier, an owned box has a destructor to clean up the allocated\n+memory.
