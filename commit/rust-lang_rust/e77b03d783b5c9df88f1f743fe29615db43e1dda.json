Currently the compiler chokes\r\non these paths as it assumes that each file in the archive is only the filename\r\n(which is what unix does).\r\n\r\nThis commit interprets the name of each file in all archives as a path and then\r\nonly uses the `file_name` portion of the path to extract the file to a separate\r\nlocation and then reassemble it back into a new archive later. Note that\r\nduplicate filenames are already handled, so this won't introduce any conflicts.", "tree": {"sha": "6d712c76ccad4d008a2bd8e30f1ed114d9a21f5a", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/6d712c76ccad4d008a2bd8e30f1ed114d9a21f5a"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/e77b03d783b5c9df88f1f743fe29615db43e1dda", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/e77b03d783b5c9df88f1f743fe29615db43e1dda", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/e77b03d783b5c9df88f1f743fe29615db43e1dda", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/e77b03d783b5c9df88f1f743fe29615db43e1dda/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "1b5b6390ba98577741261eef5961cc6e8b0075e1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/1b5b6390ba98577741261eef5961cc6e8b0075e1", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/1b5b6390ba98577741261eef5961cc6e8b0075e1"}, {"sha": "f1ab6648fc67ff8af274d2e65a400de9af0e9ddf", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/f1ab6648fc67ff8af274d2e65a400de9af0e9ddf", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/f1ab6648fc67ff8af274d2e65a400de9af0e9ddf"}], "stats": {"total": 15, "additions": 15, "deletions": 0}, "files": [{"sha": "cad1522ee1344b22b81a7382d18fe7104c83be49", "filename": "src/librustc_back/archive.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 15, "deletions": 0, "changes": 15, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e77b03d783b5c9df88f1f743fe29615db43e1dda/src%2Flibrustc_back%2Farchive.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/e77b03d783b5c9df88f1f743fe29615db43e1dda/src%2Flibrustc_back%2Farchive.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Flibrustc_back%2Farchive.rs?ref=e77b03d783b5c9df88f1f743fe29615db43e1dda", "patch": "@@ -306,6 +306,21 @@ impl<'a> ArchiveBuilder<'a> {\n             if filename.contains(\".SYMDEF\") { continue }\n             if skip(filename) { continue }\n \n+            // Archives on unix systems typically do not have slashes in\n+            // filenames as the `ar` utility generally only uses the last\n+            // component of a path for the filename list in the archive.
