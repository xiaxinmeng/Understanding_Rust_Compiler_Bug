By seeing graphs of CPU usage over time we hope to correlate\n+# that with possible improvements to Rust's own build system, ideally diagnosing\n+# that either builders are always fully using their CPU resources or they're\n+# idle for long stretches of time.\n+#\n+# This script is relatively simple, but it's platform specific. Each platform\n+# (OSX/Windows/Linux) has a different way of calculating the current state of\n+# CPU at a point in time.

The state capturing is\n+# all platform-specific but the loop at the bottom is the cross platform part\n+# that executes everywhere.\n+#\n+# # Viewing statistics\n+#\n+# All builders will upload their CPU statistics as CSV files to our S3 buckets.\n+# These URLS look like:\n+#\n+#   https://$bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/rustc-builds/$commit/cpu-$builder.csv\n+#\n+# for example\n+#\n+#   https://rust-lang-ci2.s3.amazonaws.com/rustc-builds/68baada19cd5340f05f0db15a3e16d6671609bcc/cpu-x86_64-apple.csv\n+#\n+# Each CSV file has two columns. The first is the timestamp of the measurement\n+# and the second column is the % of idle cpu time in that time slice. Ideally\n+# the second column is always zero.\n+#\n+# Once you've downloaded a file there's various ways to plot it and visualize\n+# it.
