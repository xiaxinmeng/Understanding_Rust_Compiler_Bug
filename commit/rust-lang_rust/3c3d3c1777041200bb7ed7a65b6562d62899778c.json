My guess is that it was meant to be removed in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23601, but was overlooked.\n\nIf I remove this bound, `./x.py src/libstd/ src/libcore/` passes, which means at least that this is not covered by test.\n\nI think there's three things we can do here:\n\n* run crater with the bound removed to check if there are any regressions, and merge this, to be consistent with other operator traits\n* run crater, get regressions, write a test for this with a note that \"hey, we tried to fix it, its unfixable\"\n* decide, in the light of by-value DSTs, that this is a feature rather than a bug, and add a test\n\ncc @rust-lang/libs\n\nEDIT: the forth alternative is that there exist a genuine reason why this is the case, but I failed to see it :D", "tree": {"sha": "1475fc81e1b201e1944a5cc843c89470e8587396", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/1475fc81e1b201e1944a5cc843c89470e8587396"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/3c3d3c1777041200bb7ed7a65b6562d62899778c", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/3c3d3c1777041200bb7ed7a65b6562d62899778c", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/3c3d3c1777041200bb7ed7a65b6562d62899778c", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/3c3d3c1777041200bb7ed7a65b6562d62899778c/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "8260e9676089363648dfbce072fca562093b4289", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/8260e9676089363648dfbce072fca562093b4289", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/8260e9676089363648dfbce072fca562093b4289"}, {"sha": "cc3abc4d2786be6d8366eb904b8ea4ac4a3e9f7e", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/cc3abc4d2786be6d8366eb904b8ea4ac4a3e9f7e", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/cc3abc4d2786be6d8366eb904b8ea4ac4a3e9f7e"}], "stats": {"total": 23, "additions": 23, "deletions": 0}, "files": [{"sha": "2e6bd82bda302b34a5da5c9f07b7d17bf067015d", "filename": "src/test/ui/unsized-locals/unsized-index.rs", "status": "added", "additions": 23, "deletions": 0, "changes": 23, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3c3d3c1777041200bb7ed7a65b6562d62899778c/src%2Ftest%2Fui%2Funsized-locals%2Funsized-index.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/3c3d3c1777041200bb7ed7a65b6562d62899778c/src%2Ftest%2Fui%2Funsized-locals%2Funsized-index.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Ftest%2Fui%2Funsized-locals%2Funsized-index.rs?ref=3c3d3c1777041200bb7ed7a65b6562d62899778c", "patch": "@@ -0,0 +1,23 @@\n+// compile-pass\n+\n+// `std::ops::Index` has an `: ?Sized` bound on the `Idx` type param.
