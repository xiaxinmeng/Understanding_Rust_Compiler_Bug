Does Mozilla need to own the copyright on code submitted to Rust?\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is that, since the last time I submitted anything to a Mozilla project, I started working at Google, and they (by default) own the copyright on code that I write (even in my spare time). There's a process to assign copyright to another entity, and it should be a formality for something like this, but I'd still have to go through it if that's a requirement for Rust.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm submitting this incredibly trivial thing because, if I have to go through that process for the first time, I'd like it to be for something that's trivial, so I can see how much of a hassle it is (if any) without having invested much time up front.\r\n\r\nI didn't see anything about copyright in the Mozilla contributor's agreement, but I could have easily missed something somewhere else.", "tree": {"sha": "49909c2ffc0ac805451eaada0d1ec757ff49690d", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/49909c2ffc0ac805451eaada0d1ec757ff49690d"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/f6fccdea8a16c276fa72c8faa35e8d568612e964", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/f6fccdea8a16c276fa72c8faa35e8d568612e964", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/f6fccdea8a16c276fa72c8faa35e8d568612e964", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/f6fccdea8a16c276fa72c8faa35e8d568612e964/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "8a60caa107b7a55f480ae60a5184bd2e2a6319e7", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/8a60caa107b7a55f480ae60a5184bd2e2a6319e7", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/8a60caa107b7a55f480ae60a5184bd2e2a6319e7"}, {"sha": "3503d0bcd19d9c6ce80961fd1d972afb64963cd9", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/3503d0bcd19d9c6ce80961fd1d972afb64963cd9", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/3503d0bcd19d9c6ce80961fd1d972afb64963cd9"}], "stats": {"total": 7, "additions": 2, "deletions": 5}, "files": [{"sha": "2d0b4f37b2f676dc01e6aba451a6dcb48c1d9546", "filename": "src/test/run-pass/deriving-self-lifetime-totalord-totaleq.rs", "status": "modified", "additions": 2, "deletions": 5, "changes": 7, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f6fccdea8a16c276fa72c8faa35e8d568612e964/src%2Ftest%2Frun-pass%2Fderiving-self-lifetime-totalord-totaleq.rs", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/f6fccdea8a16c276fa72c8faa35e8d568612e964/src%2Ftest%2Frun-pass%2Fderiving-self-lifetime-totalord-totaleq.rs", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/src%2Ftest%2Frun-pass%2Fderiving-self-lifetime-totalord-totaleq.rs?ref=f6fccdea8a16c276fa72c8faa35e8d568612e964", "patch": "@@ -1,5 +1,3 @@\n-// xfail-test FIXME #6257\n-\n // Copyright 2013 The Rust Project Developers.
