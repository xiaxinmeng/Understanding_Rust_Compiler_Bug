We must encode the command and arguments\nsuch that `CommandLineToArgvW` recovers them in the spawned process.\nSimplify the logic by using a running count of backslashes as they\nare encountered instead of looking ahead for quotes following them.\n\nExtend `test_make_command_line` to additionally cover:\n\n* a leading quote in an argument that requires quotes,\n* a backslash before a quote in an argument that requires quotes,\n* a backslash at the end of an argument that requires quotes, and\n* a backslash at the end of an argument that does not require quotes.", "tree": {"sha":
