CC @rust-lang/core.)\n\nCurrently, rust-lang/rust includes notices that say things like\n```\nThe Rust Project is copyright 2010, The Rust Project\nDevelopers.\n```\nor\n```\nCopyright (c) 2010 The Rust Project Developers\n```\nor\n```\n// Copyright 2017 The Rust Project Developers. See the COPYRIGHT\n// file at the top-level directory of this distribution and at\n// http://rust-lang.org/COPYRIGHT.\n```\n\nThese notices aren't accurate. \"Copyright YYYY Some Name\" has a specific legal meaning, and \"The Rust Project Developers\" isn't a legal entity. In practice, the actual legal structure is that all Rust contributors retain their copyrights when contributing to Rust, and just license them under MIT/Apache-2.0. Our legal notices should reflect that.\n\nThis came up because of RFC 2044, which proposed fixing this for the RFC repository. That effort started out by copying the rust-lang/rust notices, propagating this issue.\n\nBased on discussion with @aturon, the two of us propose the following:\n\n- Delete the per-file notices entirely, for any files licensed under the standard terms. (Keep notices for anything that's *not* MIT/Apache-2.0.)\n  - An alternative to that would be to just delete the first paragraph of the standard notice, and keep the second paragraph that points to the MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses.\n- Delete the first paragraph of LICENSE-MIT (the inaccurate pseudo-copyright line), leaving only the text of the MIT license.\n- Edit the COPYRIGHT file to more accurately describe the situation (changing the pseudo-copyright line immediately under \"longer version\", and editing the text that starts with \"additional copyright may be ...\", to just always state that copyrights are retained by the Rust contributors, and licensed under MIT/Apache-2.0 (with the exceptions to that explicitly noted in that file).\n\nIf @rust-lang/core is fine with this proposal, I'd be happy to provide a pull request with the proposed fixes.", "tree": {"sha": "aa0a2d6e9d5f164c32de0100b298747d28aee784", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/aa0a2d6e9d5f164c32de0100b298747d28aee784"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/0565653eecd7d667dbb28bb5d3008e783950892a", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/0565653eecd7d667dbb28bb5d3008e783950892a", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/0565653eecd7d667dbb28bb5d3008e783950892a", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/0565653eecd7d667dbb28bb5d3008e783950892a/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "f60d373422656da31863e3e7961142c420b28809", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/f60d373422656da31863e3e7961142c420b28809", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/f60d373422656da31863e3e7961142c420b28809"}, {"sha": "f1de27fe6b73a8463fb49d4d2c88a24fa7031b82", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/f1de27fe6b73a8463fb49d4d2c88a24fa7031b82", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/f1de27fe6b73a8463fb49d4d2c88a24fa7031b82"}], "stats": {"total": 43, "additions": 10, "deletions": 33}, "files": [{"sha": "f8b637d204aceaec782ac22668d2bd72c6c15820", "filename": "COPYRIGHT", "status": "modified", "additions": 10, "deletions": 31, "changes": 41, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/0565653eecd7d667dbb28bb5d3008e783950892a/COPYRIGHT", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/0565653eecd7d667dbb28bb5d3008e783950892a/COPYRIGHT", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/COPYRIGHT?ref=0565653eecd7d667dbb28bb5d3008e783950892a", "patch": "@@ -6,16 +6,17 @@ terms.\n \n Longer version:\n \n-The Rust Project is copyright 2010, The Rust Project\n-Developers.\n+Copyrights in the Rust project are retained by their contributors.
