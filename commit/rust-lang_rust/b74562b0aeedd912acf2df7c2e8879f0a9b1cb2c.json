You can't have a guessing game without the ability\n to guess!\n \n+## Standard Input\n+\n+Getting input from the keyboard is pretty easy, but uses some things\n+we haven't seen before. Here's a simple program that reads some input,\n+and then prints it back out:\n+\n+```{rust,ignore}\n+fn main() {\n+    println!(\"Type something!\");\n+\n+    let input = std::io::stdin().read_line().ok().expect(\"Failed to read line\");\n+\n+    println!(\"{}\", input);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Let's go over these chunks, one by one:\n+\n+```{rust}\n+std::io::stdin();\n+```\n+\n+This calls a function, `stdin()`, that lives inside the `std::io` module. As\n+you can imagine, everything in `std` is provided by Rust, the 'standard\n+library.' We'll talk more about the module system later.\n+\n+Since writing the fully qualified name all the time is annoying, we can use\n+the `use` statement to import it in:\n+\n+```{rust}\n+use std::io::stdin;\n+\n+stdin();\n+```\n+\n+However, it's considered better practice to not import individual functions, but\n+to import the module, and only use one level of qualification:\n+\n+```{rust}\n+use std::io;\n+\n+io::stdin();\n+```\n+\n+Let's update our example to use this style:\n+\n+```{rust,ignore}\n+use std::io;\n+\n+fn main() {\n+    println!(\"Type something!\");\n+\n+    let input = io::stdin().read_line().ok().expect(\"Failed to read line\");\n+\n+    println!(\"{}\", input);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Next up:\n+\n+```{rust,ignore}\n+.read_line()\n+```\n+\n+The `read_line()` method can be called on the result of `stdin()` to return\n+a full line of input. Nice and easy.\n+\n+```{rust,ignore}\n+.ok().expect(\"Failed to read line\");\n+```\n+\n+Here's the thing: reading a line from standard input could fail. For example,\n+if this program isn't running in a terminal, but is running as part of a cron\n+job, or some other context where there's no standard input. So Rust expects us\n+to handle this case. Given that we plan on always running this program in a\n+terminal, we use the `ok()` method to tell Rust that we're expecting everything\n+to be just peachy, and the `expect()` method on that result to give an error\n+message if our expectation goes wrong.\n+\n+We will cover the exact details of how all of this works later in the Guide.\n+For now, this is all you need.\n+\n+With long lines like this, Rust gives you some flexibility with the whitespace.\n+We _could_ write the example like this:\n+\n+```{rust,ignore}\n+use std::io;\n+\n+fn main() {\n+    println!(\"Type something!\");\n+\n+    let input = io::stdin()\n+                  .read_line()\n+                  .ok()\n+                  .expect(\"Failed to read line\");\n+\n+    println!(\"{}\", input);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Sometimes, this makes things more readable. Sometimes, less. Use your judgement\n+here.\n+\n+That's all you need to get basic input from the standard input! It's not too\n+complicated, but there are a number of small parts.\n+\n ## Guessing Game: complete\n \n At this point, you have successfully built the Guessing Game! Congratulations!"}]}
