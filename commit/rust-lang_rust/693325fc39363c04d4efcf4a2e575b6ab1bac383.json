A simplified AST that only contains items.\n+//!\n+//! This is the primary IR used throughout `hir_def`. It is the input to the name resolution\n+//! algorithm, as well as to the queries defined in `adt.rs`, `data.rs`, and most things in\n+//! `attr.rs`.\n+//!\n+//! `ItemTree`s are built per `HirFileId`, from the syntax tree of the parsed file. This means that\n+//! they are crate-independent: they don't know which `#[cfg]`s are active or which module they\n+//! belong to, since those concepts don't exist at this level (a single `ItemTree` might be part of\n+//! multiple crates, or might be included into the same crate twice via `#[path]`).\n+//!\n+//! One important purpose of this layer is to provide an \"invalidation barrier\" for incremental\n+//! computations: when typing inside an item body, the `ItemTree` of the modified file is typically\n+//! unaffected, so we don't have to recompute name resolution results or item data (see `data.rs`).\n+//!\n+//! The `ItemTree` for the currently open file can be displayed by using the VS Code command\n+//! \"Rust Analyzer: Debug ItemTree\".\n+//!\n+//! Compared to rustc's architecture, `ItemTree` has properties from both rustc's AST and HIR: many\n+//! syntax-level Rust features are already desugared to simpler forms in the `ItemTree`, but name\n+//! resolution has not yet been performed. `ItemTree`s are per-file, while rustc's AST and HIR are\n+//! per-crate, because we are interested in incrementally computing it.\n+//!\n+//! The representation of items in the `ItemTree` should generally mirror the surface syntax: it is\n+//! usually a bad idea to desugar a syntax-level construct to something that is structurally\n+//! different here. Name resolution needs to be able to process attributes and expand macros\n+//! (including attribute macros), and having a 1-to-1 mapping between syntax and the `ItemTree`\n+//! avoids introducing subtle bugs.\n+//!\n+//! In general, any item in the `ItemTree` stores its `AstId`, which allows mapping it back to its\n+//! surface syntax.\n \n mod lower;\n mod pretty;\n@@ -500,8 +530,8 @@ pub struct Import {\n     pub alias: Option<ImportAlias>,\n     pub visibility: RawVisibilityId,\n     pub is_glob: bool,\n-    /// AST ID of the `use` or `extern crate` item this import was derived from.
