For a recoverable error, such as a file\n-not found error, it\u2019s reasonable to report the problem to the user and retry\n-the operation. Unrecoverable errors are always symptoms of bugs, like trying to\n-access a location beyond the end of an array.\n+The Rust language provides two complementary systems for constructing /\n+representing, reporting, propagating, reacting to, and discarding errors. These\n+responsibilities are collectively known as \"error handling.\" `panic!` and\n+`Result` are similar in that they are each the primary interface of their\n+respective error handling systems; however, the meaning these interfaces attach\n+to their errors and the responsibilities they fulfill within their respective\n+error handling systems differ.\n \n-The Rust language and standard library provides `Result` and `panic!` as parts\n-of two complementary systems for representing, reporting, propagating, reacting\n-to, and discarding errors for in these two categories.\n+The `panic!` macro is used to construct errors that represent a bug that has\n+been detected in your program. With `panic!` you provide a message that\n+describes the bug and the language then constructs an error with that message,\n+reports it, and propagates it for you.\n \n-The `panic!` macro is provided to represent unrecoverable errors, whereas the\n-`Result` enum is provided to represent recoverable errors. For more detailed\n-information about error handling check out the [book] or the [`std::result`]\n-module docs.\n+`Result` on the other hand is used to wrap other types that represent either\n+the successful result of some computation, `Ok(T)`, or error types that\n+represent an anticipated runtime failure mode of that computation, `Err(E)`.\n+`Result` is used alongside user defined types which represent the various\n+anticipated runtime failure modes that the associated computation could\n+encounter. `Result` must be propagated manually, often with the the help of the\n+`?` operator and `Try` trait, and they must be reported manually, often with\n+the help of the `Error` trait.\n+\n+For more detailed information about error handling check out the [book] or the\n+[`std::result`] module docs.\n \n [ounwrap]: Option::unwrap\n [runwrap]: Result::unwrap"}]}
