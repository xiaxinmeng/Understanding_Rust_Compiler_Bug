As we approach a 1.0 release we are also looking\n+to limit areas of instability; in particular, post-1.0, the formatting of most\n+code should not change as Rustfmt improves. However, there are some things that\n+Rustfmt can't do or can't do well (and thus where formatting might change\n+significantly, even post-1.0). We would like to reduce the list of limitations\n+over time.\n+\n+The following list enumerates areas where Rustfmt does not work or where the\n+stability guarantees do not apply (we don't make a distinction between the two\n+because in the future Rustfmt might work on code where it currently does not):\n+\n+* a program where any part of the program does not parse (parsing is an early\n+  stage of compilation and in Rust includes macro expansion).\n+* Macro declarations and uses (current status: some macro declarations and uses\n+  are formatted).\n+* Comments, including any AST node with a comment 'inside' (Rustfmt does not\n+  currently attempt to format comments, it does format code with comments inside, but that formatting may change in the future).\n+* Rust code in code blocks in comments.\n+* Any fragment of a program (i.e., stability guarantees only apply to whole\n+  programs, even where fragments of a program can be formatted today).\n+* Code containing non-ascii unicode characters (we believe Rustfmt mostly works\n+  here, but do not have the test coverage or experience to be 100% sure).\n+* Bugs in Rustfmt (like any software, Rustfmt has bugs, we do not consider bug\n+  fixes to break our stability guarantees).\n+\n+\n ## Installation\n \n ```"}]}
