All references have a\n-lifetime, and so if you elide a lifetime (like `&T` instead of `&'a T`), Rust\n-will do three things to determine what those lifetimes should be.\n+Rust supports powerful local type inference in function bodies, but it\u2019s\n+forbidden in item signatures to allow reasoning about the types just based in\n+the item signature alone. However, for ergonomic reasons a very restricted\n+secondary inference algorithm called \u201clifetime elision\u201d applies in function\n+signatures. It infers only based on the signature components themselves and not\n+based on the body of the function, only infers lifetime paramters, and does\n+this with only three easily memorizable and unambiguous rules. This makes\n+lifetime elision a shorthand for writing an item signature, while not hiding\n+away the actual types involved as full local inference would if applied to it.\n \n When talking about lifetime elision, we use the term *input lifetime* and\n *output lifetime*. An *input lifetime* is a lifetime associated with a parameter"}]}
