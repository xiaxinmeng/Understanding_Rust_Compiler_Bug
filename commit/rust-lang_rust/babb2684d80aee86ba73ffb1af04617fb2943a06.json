A coercion is implicit and has no syntax.\n+\n+[RFC401]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0401-coercions.md\n+\n+### Coercion sites\n+\n+A coercion can only occur at certain coercion sites in a program; these are\n+typically places where the desired type is explicit or can be dervied by\n+propagation from explicit types (without type inference). Possible coercion\n+sites are:\n+\n+* `let` statements where an explicit type is given.\n+\n+    In `let _: U = e;`, `e` is coerced to have type `U`.\n+\n+* `static` and `const` statements (similar to `let` statements).\n+\n+* arguments for function calls.\n+\n+    The value being coerced is the\n+    actual parameter and it is coerced to the type of the formal parameter. For\n+    example, let `foo` be defined as `fn foo(x: U) { ... }` and call it as\n+    `foo(e);`. Then `e` is coerced to have type `U`;\n+\n+* instantiations of struct or variant fields.\n+\n+    Assume we have a `struct\n+    Foo { x: U }` and instantiate it as `Foo { x: e }`. Then `e` is coerced to\n+    have type `U`.\n+\n+* function results (either the final line of a block if it is not semicolon\n+terminated or any expression in a `return` statement).\n+\n+    In `fn foo() -> U { e }`, `e` is coerced to to have type `U`.\n+\n+If the expression in one of these coercion sites is a coercion-propagating\n+expression, then the relevant sub-expressions in that expression are also\n+coercion sites. Propagation recurses from these new coercion sites.\n+Propagating expressions and their relevant sub-expressions are:\n+\n+* array literals, where the array has type `[U; n]`. Each sub-expression in\n+the array literal is a coercion site for coercion to type `U`.\n+\n+* array literals with repeating syntax, where the array has type `[U; n]`. The\n+repeated sub-expression is a coercion site for coercion to type `U`.\n+\n+* tuples, where a tuple is a coercion site to type `(U_0, U_1, ..., U_n)`.\n+Each sub-expression is a coercion site to the respective type, e.g. the\n+zeroth sub-expression is a coercion site to type `U_0`.\n+\n+* parenthesised sub-expressions (`(e)`). If the expression has type `U`, then\n+the sub-expression is a coercion site to `U`.\n+\n+* blocks. If a block has type `U`, then the last expression in the block (if\n+it is not semicolon-terminated) is a coercion site to `U`. This includes\n+blocks which are part of control flow statements, such as `if`/`else`, if\n+the block has a known type.\n+\n+### Coercion types\n+\n+Coercion is allowed between the following types:\n+\n+* `T` to `U` if `T` is a subtype of `U` (*reflexive case*).\n+\n+* `T_1` to `T_3` where `T_1` coerces to `T_2` and `T_2` coerces to `T_3`\n+(*transitive case*).\n+\n+    Note that this is not fully supported yet\n+\n+* `&mut T` to `&T`.\n+\n+* `*mut T` to `*const T`.\n+\n+* `&T` to `*const T`.\n+\n+* `&mut T` to `*mut T`.\n+\n+* `&T` to `&U` if `T` implements `Deref<Target = U>`. For example:\n+    ```\n+    use std::ops::Deref;\n+\n+    struct CharContainer {\n+        value: char\n+    }\n+\n+    impl Deref for CharContainer {\n+        type Target = char;\n+\n+        fn deref<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a char {\n+            &self.value\n+        }\n+    }\n+\n+    fn foo(arg: &char) {}\n+\n+    fn main() {\n+        let x = &mut CharContainer { value: 'y' };\n+        foo(x); //&mut CharContainer is coerced to &char.\n+    }\n+    ```\n+* `&mut T` to `&mut U` if `T` implements `DerefMut<Target = U>`.\n+\n+* TyCtor(`T`) to TyCtor(coerce_inner(`T`)), where TyCtor(`T`) is one of\n+    - `&T`\n+    - `&mut T`\n+    - `*const T`\n+    - `*mut T`\n+    - `Box<T>`\n+\n+    and where\n+    - coerce_inner(`[T, ..n]`) = `[T]`\n+    - coerce_inner(`T`) = `U` where `T` is a concrete type which implements the\n+    trait `U`.\n+\n+    In the future, coerce_inner will be recursively extended to tuples and\n+    structs. In addition, coercions from sub-traits to super-traits will be\n+    added. See [RFC401] for more details.\n+\n # Special traits\n \n Several traits define special evaluation behavior."}]}
