I think we need to be careful not use the pedantic category as cover-all for lints with any amount of false positives. Lints with a high degree of FPs should be nursery or restriction IMO. If the pedantic category were to yield, say hypothetically, over 50% FPs, it would just be too annoying to use at all (to be sure, \"too picky for me\" is not a FP).\n\nCC `@rust-lang/clippy`", "tree": {"sha": "0b81a868e65a690fd90ad0d454e4b27593e1bdaf", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/0b81a868e65a690fd90ad0d454e4b27593e1bdaf"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/3cd54ba637760f301873358bd0fd8106b2d1a9d9", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/3cd54ba637760f301873358bd0fd8106b2d1a9d9", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/3cd54ba637760f301873358bd0fd8106b2d1a9d9", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/3cd54ba637760f301873358bd0fd8106b2d1a9d9/comments", "author": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "bors", "id": 3372342, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors", "html_url": "https://github.com/bors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "a4a8ec2d52f882c711491544f6831328f04882ea", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/a4a8ec2d52f882c711491544f6831328f04882ea", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/a4a8ec2d52f882c711491544f6831328f04882ea"}, {"sha": "27bb76b5f318d0e70ac19af283c5f70528e3c61b", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/27bb76b5f318d0e70ac19af283c5f70528e3c61b", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/27bb76b5f318d0e70ac19af283c5f70528e3c61b"}], "stats": {"total": 2, "additions": 1, "deletions": 1}, "files": [{"sha": "822335fc65f13f1616203bb5b0a989efa80c5154", "filename": "README.md", "status": "modified", "additions": 1, "deletions": 1, "changes": 2, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3cd54ba637760f301873358bd0fd8106b2d1a9d9/README.md", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/3cd54ba637760f301873358bd0fd8106b2d1a9d9/README.md", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/README.md?ref=3cd54ba637760f301873358bd0fd8106b2d1a9d9", "patch": "@@ -18,7 +18,7 @@ You can choose how much Clippy is supposed to ~~annoy~~ help you by changing the\n | `clippy::style`       | code that should be written in a more idiomatic way                                 | **warn**      |\n | `clippy::complexity`  | code that does something simple but in a complex way                                | **warn**      |\n | `clippy::perf`        | code that can be written to run faster                                              | **warn**      |\n-| `clippy::pedantic`    | lints which are rather strict or might have false positives                         | allow         |\n+| `clippy::pedantic`    | lints which are rather strict or have occasional false positives                    | allow         |\n | `clippy::nursery`     | new lints that are still under development                                          | allow         |\n | `clippy::cargo`       | lints for the cargo manifest                                                        | allow         |\n "}]}
