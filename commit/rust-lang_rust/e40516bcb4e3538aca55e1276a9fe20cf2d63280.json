The simplest way is to use a\n+`void *` argument:\n+\n+```c\n+void foo(void *arg);\n+void bar(void *arg);\n+```\n+\n+We can represent this in Rust with the `c_void` type:\n+\n+```rust\n+# #![feature(libc)]\n+extern crate libc;\n+\n+extern \"C\" {\n+    pub fn foo(arg: *mut libc::c_void);\n+    pub fn bar(arg: *mut libc::c_void);\n+}\n+# fn main() {}\n+```\n+\n+This is a perfectly valid way of handling the situation. However, we can do a bit\n+better. To solve this, some C libraries will instead create a `struct`, where\n+the details and memory layout of the struct are private. This gives some amount\n+of type safety. These structures are called \u2018opaque\u2019. Here\u2019s an example, in C:\n+\n+```c\n+struct Foo; /* Foo is a structure, but its contents are not part of the public interface */\n+struct Bar;\n+void foo(struct Foo *arg);\n+void bar(struct Bar *arg);\n+```\n+\n+To do this in Rust, let\u2019s create our own opaque types with `enum`:\n+\n+```rust\n+pub enum Foo {}\n+pub enum Bar {}\n+\n+extern \"C\" {\n+    pub fn foo(arg: *mut Foo);\n+    pub fn bar(arg: *mut Bar);\n+}\n+# fn main() {}\n+```\n+\n+By using an `enum` with no variants, we create an opaque type that we can\u2019t\n+instantiate, as it has no variants. But because our `Foo` and `Bar` types are\n+different, we\u2019ll get type safety between the two of them, so we cannot\n+accidentally pass a pointer to `Foo` to `bar()`."}]}
