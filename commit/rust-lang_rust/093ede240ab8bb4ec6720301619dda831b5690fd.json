The new format moves\ninformation around and compresses the lock file a bit. The intention of\nthe new format is to reduce the amount of git merge conflicts that\nhappen in a repository, with rust-lang/rust being a prime candidate for\ntesting this.\n\nThe new format wille ventually become the default but for now it is\noff-by-default in Cargo, but Cargo will preserve the format if it sees\nit. Since we always build with a beta version of Cargo for the\nrust-lang/rust repository it should be safe to go ahead and change the\nlock file format here and everyone building this repository will\nautomatically pick it up.\n\nIt's intended that we'll evaluate this lock file format in the\nrust-lang/rust repository to see if it reduces the number of perceived\nmerge conflicts for changes that touch the lock file. This will in turn\nhelp inform the development of the feature in Cargo and whether we\nchoose to stabilize this and turn it on by default.\n\nNote that this commit does not actually change the contents of the lock\nfile in terms of a resolution graph, it simply reencodes the lock file\nwith a new format.", "tree": {"sha": "e2d63a7c7d2235d7b299652a930199fea220bab3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/trees/e2d63a7c7d2235d7b299652a930199fea220bab3"}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/git/commits/093ede240ab8bb4ec6720301619dda831b5690fd", "comment_count": 0, "verification": {"verified": false, "reason": "unsigned", "signature": null, "payload": null}}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/093ede240ab8bb4ec6720301619dda831b5690fd", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/093ede240ab8bb4ec6720301619dda831b5690fd", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/093ede240ab8bb4ec6720301619dda831b5690fd/comments", "author": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "committer": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "parents": [{"sha": "f86521e0a33a2b54c4c23dbfc5250013f7a33b11", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/commits/f86521e0a33a2b54c4c23dbfc5250013f7a33b11", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/f86521e0a33a2b54c4c23dbfc5250013f7a33b11"}], "stats": {"total": 3786, "additions": 1892, "deletions": 1894}, "files": [{"sha": "910d6ba22c16f2a89e2708d7d49f079a9ae3f435", "filename": "Cargo.lock", "status": "modified", "additions": 1892, "deletions": 1894, "changes": 3786, "blob_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/093ede240ab8bb4ec6720301619dda831b5690fd/Cargo.lock", "raw_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/raw/093ede240ab8bb4ec6720301619dda831b5690fd/Cargo.lock", "contents_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/contents/Cargo.lock?ref=093ede240ab8bb4ec6720301619dda831b5690fd"}]}
