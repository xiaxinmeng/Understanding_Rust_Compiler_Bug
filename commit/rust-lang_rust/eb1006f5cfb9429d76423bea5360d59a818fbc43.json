While doing so, it will sometimes encounter a DepNode\n+/// where we don't know if it is red or green and we therefore actually have\n+/// to recompute its value in order to find out. Since the only piece of\n+/// information that we have at that point is the DepNode we are trying to\n+/// re-evaluate, we need some way to re-run a query from just that. This is what\n+/// `force_from_dep_node()` implements.\n+///\n+/// In the general case, a DepNode consists of a DepKind and an opaque\n+/// GUID/fingerprint that will uniquely identify the node. This GUID/fingerprint\n+/// is usually constructed by computing a stable hash of the query-key that the\n+/// DepNode corresponds to. Consequently, it is not in general possible to go\n+/// back from hash to query-key (since hash functions are not reversible). For\n+/// this reason `force_from_dep_node()` is expected to fail from time to time\n+/// because we just cannot find out, from the DepNode alone, what the\n+/// corresponding query-key is and therefore cannot re-run the query.\n+///\n+/// The system deals with this case letting `try_mark_green` fail which forces\n+/// the root query to be re-evaluated.\n+///\n+/// Now, if force_from_dep_node() would always fail, it would be pretty useless.\n+/// Fortunately, we can use some contextual information that will allow us to\n+/// reconstruct query-keys for certain kinds of DepNodes. In particular, we\n+/// enforce by construction that the GUID/fingerprint of certain DepNodes is a\n+/// valid DefPathHash. Since we also always build a huge table that maps every\n+/// DefPathHash in the current codebase to the corresponding DefId, we have\n+/// everything we need to re-run the query.\n+///\n+/// Take the `mir_validated` query as an example. Like many other queries, it\n+/// just has a single parameter: the DefId of the item it will compute the\n+/// validated MIR for. Now, when we call `force_from_dep_node()` on a dep-node\n+/// with kind `MirValidated`, we know that the GUID/fingerprint of the dep-node\n+/// is actually a DefPathHash, and can therefore just look up the corresponding\n+/// DefId in `tcx.def_path_hash_to_def_id`.\n+///\n+/// When you implement a new query, it will likely have a corresponding new\n+/// DepKind, and you'll have to support it here in `force_from_dep_node()`. As\n+/// a rule of thumb, if your query takes a DefId or DefIndex as sole parameter,\n+/// then `force_from_dep_node()` should not fail for it. Otherwise, you can just\n+/// add it to the \"We don't have enough information to reconstruct...\" group in\n+/// the match below.\n pub fn force_from_dep_node<'a, 'gcx, 'lcx>(tcx: TyCtxt<'a, 'gcx, 'lcx>,\n                                            dep_node: &DepNode)\n                                            -> bool {\n@@ -687,16 +730,16 @@ pub fn force_from_dep_node<'a, 'gcx, 'lcx>(tcx: TyCtxt<'a, 'gcx, 'lcx>,\n         DepKind::Hir |\n \n         // This are anonymous nodes\n+        DepKind::TraitSelect |\n+\n+        // We don't have enough information to reconstruct the query key of\n+        // these\n         DepKind::IsCopy |\n         DepKind::IsSized |\n         DepKind::IsFreeze |\n         DepKind::NeedsDrop |\n         DepKind::Layout |\n-        DepKind::TraitSelect |\n         DepKind::ConstEval |\n-\n-        // We don't have enough information to reconstruct the query key of\n-        // these\n         DepKind::InstanceSymbolName |\n         DepKind::MirShim |\n         DepKind::BorrowCheckKrate |"}]}
